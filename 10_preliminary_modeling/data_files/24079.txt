Me and my friend Lisa are in the theater watching a movie with Adam Sanders. In the movie we're watching he's picked up a hitchhiker and they're in the car talking. The conversation isn't funny; it's creepy for some reason, and as it continues I'm not in the theater any more. I'm watching the movie as I drive with Lisa and we're watching it transposed on the windshield of my car. In the movie Adam Sandler asks where the hitchhiker wants to get out and instead of answering, he pulls out a knife and starts stabbing him. Adam also pulls out a knife and there starts a bloody battle in the car. I'm watching this while driving and reach down at the dashboard and press pause because I don't want to miss this good part of the movie and we're heading into some sharp turns. As we round the first turn, we see boulders strewn all over the place and I have to weave in and out of them. And as I enter the second turn, the car loses traction and we enter a flat spin. I'm not worried at all, which I find odd, but Lisa panics and starts screaming. She lunges toward me and grabs onto me. We level out and she lets go, but just as she calms down, we start sliding again and Lisa puts her back to the window and screams, with an awful look on her face she yells, "Help!" And I wake up really scared, like from a nightmare.
