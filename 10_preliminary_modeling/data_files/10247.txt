I am asked to participate at a SWIM MEET: We are to practice the back stroke. I hesitate, but then I agree. I am wearing a dark blue bathing suit and am with Pedro and a woman who looks like Marissa Camden. I talk with them and others as we stand in the chow line: we get a bowl of grits and beans, which are ladled into the middle of my bowl. I am not very hungry.
