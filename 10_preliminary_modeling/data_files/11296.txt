I was in my house, in the basement. I was closing up the house. No one else was there. I felt as if I were escaping from something. There was a kind of mechanical contrivance which resembled a bicycle, which I crawled around and through. I became partially entangled in it, then escaped. Then I got on a very tiny railroad handcar no larger than a toy and began to pump furiously. Somehow it was large enough to hold me, but I got nowhere. The track took me right back to where I had started. Then I had a feeling of having made my escape and was sneaking off through the dark. I went out through a window in the garage. I closed it behind me and wanted to lock it to keep out robbers, but I couldn't. I was anxious to get away, and I left the vicinity.
