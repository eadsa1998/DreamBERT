I was sitting in the back of a car with my hands an overcoat and slouching down in the seat. I was flanked by my two roommates from Northwestern. Sitting on the end by the door was a fellow in my physics class at Reserve whom I don't even know. All of a sudden one rommmate turned to this kid whom he addressed as Katz and told him curtly to leave the three of us alone, saying he didn't have much time. Katz very docilely left.
