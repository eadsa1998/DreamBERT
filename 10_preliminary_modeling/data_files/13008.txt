I went to England. It was snowing and I was really excited. Ezra and I went to a shop. I was thinking 'Hello, we're Cockneys!'. I ate lamingtons at the shop. I was looking at stationery and was talking to some guy. Someone pulled down these quiz things from the roof. Paul Whitehouse was there and we knew each other and he did some quizzes too.
