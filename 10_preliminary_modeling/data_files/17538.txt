One of the guys who said he loved me; I ran from him as if he were Freddy Krueger.  He was very controlling.  There was a lot of running and trying to destroy him.  One strategy involved me pulling out my teeth one at a time, throwing them at someone.  I read a newspaper comic very strategically laid out, so that as you rip away one panel, it would reveal another.
