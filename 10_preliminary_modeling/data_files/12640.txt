I was at this big house and there was a werewolf. I ran into this room with Samantha and I had a plastic bag with me and it made a noise. There were little kids in the room. Elijah came to the door and the werewolf was behind him, but the werewolf only wanted me. I ran outside onto a balcony. I opened the door once I was outside so that it would open to a little girl. The wolf came and I closed it. Then I was naked. There was a place where people fix cars (and there were lots of cars). Samantha and I took a shirt from them. Then there was a clothes montage. So we took a suit. Ezra was there and we went on a seesaw. We had to stay on longer than these figures that were also on there. We won.
