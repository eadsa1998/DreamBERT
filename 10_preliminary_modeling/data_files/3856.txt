["Moving again."] I am looking at a site in Dover, or rather the outskirts of Dover where I may build a house near where Ginny and Ernie live. I see the house in the distance, with lots of windows and skylights. It looks nice. But I am a bit worried about how far away I am from the center of town. It will take longer to run my errands. I am on a bus for awhile and then I am walking and Ernie is riding a horse. We are talking in a friendly way. He reaches down his hand and holds mine. He asks me if that is OK with me. I nod and we continue talking and moving slowly on. It is a friendly and supportive moment.
