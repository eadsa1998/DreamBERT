I am trying to convince this man, who is aloof and does not respect me, that I am not a sexual slut as he seems to be convinced I am. I am looking at a scrapbook with each of my previous boyfriends in it, in chronological order. Each one has a fond memory but the overall feeling of each one is that he was a mistake. There was something wrong with each one, bad choices.
