I am considering marrying my ex-wife Bonita again.  I expect to feel a sense of revulsion at the idea, but for some reason I don't.  I do, however, feel great uncertainty.  I feel like the age I am now, but she seems to be the age she was then.  We are in bed together in her house.  We are getting ready to make love, she on top of me, and I don't feel very enthusiastic about the prospect.  She gets off, and is lying with her head at the foot of the bed when her mother comes in.  She seems a little upset--not at the fact that we are in bed together but at the way we are arranged.  At another point in the dream, I am coming by to pick Bonita up, and it turns out that on this particular night, her parents run a restaurant in their house.  The house is big, with more than one story, and the restaurant is very active.  I feel funny about just walking in, and in fact I am challenged by the maitre-d, but when I tell him why I am there, he lets me go in.
