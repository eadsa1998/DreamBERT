I dreamed I was at a huge party in some palacial ballroom that I have never seen before. The party seemed to be in my honor and I stood out in the crowds of people as if spotlights were playing on me at all times. No one came near me for there was a circle of about 15 feet where no one stood, about me and yet I was vastly happy. It reminded me of a scene in Il Trovadore during the duet.
