I was talking to Frederick about things but it was in front of others, I think, so we were doing it subtly. He said something like 'if you like the cuddling in bed it can start up again soon. But don't have any expectations. This kind of thing can create 'fairytale feelings'.' Which I took as him saying we're not dating, this is just for fun, and I tried to signal that I agreed.
