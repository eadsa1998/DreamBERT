We were having a block party and that we were driving around in a car, but first we were walking. And it was this guy's birthday, and I dreamt the calculator had a graphic equalizer and that I could do math and sing into it at the same time for this guy's birthday. And then we were driving in the car around the block party site and there were like 20 kids in line to take a ride on the fire truck. And the sirens were like unusually loud. And then I dreamt that I was laying on a bed with Maribel and my sister and I was just doing impromptu Spanish speech, and Maribel__ covered my face under the covers and then I couldn't see anybody making hand signals. And then I woke up.
