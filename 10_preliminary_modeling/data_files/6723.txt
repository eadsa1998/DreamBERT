I met Rae at church. She wanted me to go with her to visit the new Territorial Hospital at 1:30. She had to before vacation ended. I said their visiting hours were very short. We'd better find out what they were. I had their catalog at home which would give their hours. Church secretary said she had one. It was nearly 1 p.m. and I had to fix a bite of lunch first. Rae said then we'd go at 2 p.m. "Shall I come to your place?" "Yes", then both of us were at the hospital but I couldn't see Rae which disturbed me. The first impression was that the hospital was out of Koko head way, now it was in the opposite direction. We were taken to a small dining room and given lunch. The tables were for four. But the table where we were seated held more. Two women sat with us. The blond was the economic secretary. She was quite talkative. I asked many questions. She said they no longer had visiting hours. This dining room was arranged for the doctors at present.
