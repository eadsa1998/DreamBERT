I am watching a boy setting out toy furniture in a cardboard box lid to represent a Chinese home. He has a bag labeled Shanghai. I wonder if it came from there. He remarks that this furniture should help teachers who have never seen Shanghai. I told him I was born there, lived there until I was almost 13 and later taught in Chengtu. He asked if I couldn't talk to his class about China. I tell him I'm retired so it could be arranged. Another smaller boy chimes in, "sometime when your class and ours won't interfere." I go to my room and wonder how he can tell me when to come since I didn't give him my name. Find C. H. has left 2 bags in my room. I gather up mine. Notice puddle on floor and ask whence it came. Someone points out stains on ceiling to me. At the door another woman gives me a ticket to a school program on Monday morning. I can't figure out where the street is.
