 I'm at a party. I meet my friend Melanie McDyss' boyfriend Ben. It seems we have a connection because we start to joke, very subtly and seriously. He comes up to me and stands right in my face, and doesn't move. I'm lying on a beanbag chair. I do a mock kiss, to jokingly tell him to kiss off, or joke that I'm gay. There is a boxing glove near me. Ben talks to another man about the (harmful?) effects of eating a food with five ounces or five grams of O___ M___ (I forget). There are a lot of people at the party; many from high school. One man gets in my face. He is mad about his girlfriend and what she has been doing. He pulls me up to him by my head, dragging my lax body across the floor. I'm pretty drunk, and am jovial. I make up a rhyme of three words, something like, "Flab, Blab, ____", which indicates that his girlfriend has been cheating on him. The man confronting me is angry about this. He storms away. I say that my life now is college in the United States: I like the USA. But it seems I'm in Australia. I talk with people and later say that the man's girlfriend didn't really cheat on him. People laugh because of this and my non-caring attitude. Some young men laugh and call me dumb, making fun of me. I go over to them and yell that I'm kicking them out of the party. I pick up one of them and throw him over my shoulder. He doesn't resist. They yell out for someone to call security. I let out a righteous yell saying, "I am security!" I live here! I pick up the man and carry him outside. The whole time I do this I'm drunk. I worry about falling or faltering and doing something dumb. The atmosphere is relaxed.
