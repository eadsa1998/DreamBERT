I dreamt that I was taking some kind of a test and there were other people of my age. There was a teacher or professor who was giving this test and instead of having the test written out, it was coming over a PA system and we would write the answers down. The room that we were in was big like a hall and it had tables for many more students than were there. These PA systems were put all over the hall and the voice rang through the hall. As I can remember after the test we were marched out in single file and then driven to a barracks then we were locked in. That is all I can remember.
