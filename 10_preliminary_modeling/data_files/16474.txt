I was supposed to go over and see Margaret Henderson, and I went over there to her apartment complex, and I had to get the 8th floor, and I was going upstairs and going upstairs and going upstairs and going upstairs. And this apartment complex had like apartments that were on like the outside, like on a balcony, they weren't all enclosed in a hallway. And, oh, let's see -- I got to the 7th floor and knocked on their door, and the wrong person answered, and I said, "Do you where Margaret Henderson's apartment is?" and in my dream it was 813. And he said, "No, I don't." And he was like going to page somebody on his cell phone, but he said, "This is the 7th floor." And I was like, "Oh, that helps." Then I was like trying to figure out how to get up to the next floor and I couldn't figure it out, and there was all kinds of garbage and stuff around. And I think also that to get somebody, I had to go back home and help me get somebody to help me find it. And I called her and I said I was going to be a little late, and she just, she was so worried about me, and then I, people were just dawdling around the house and I had to call her and tell her I couldn't make it. And that was that.
