The bank or side of the hill along of shore way was put into green grass and corn came up amongst it. Some spots were bare and I talked of fertilizing it. I talked with a lenarcic. There were a lot of planes maneuvering over the lake. They dove into the water with the nose and half of the plane submerged. Then they came up and took up. I was close and they looked like toy planes. There were two large horses like elephants. We had a small one and I didn't want to go near them. I went around where I thought I would miss them and here they were looking at us at close range. I gave out a yell and threw up my hands and that frightened them and they ran away. There was all kinds of excitement. Ann was going to fry me some potatoes.
