I go into Susie S's house. It's in a run-down neighborhood, but it once was the best neighborhood, so the architecture and tile work are still beautiful, though dusty. She's going to have a baby. We see the nursery. The living room walls are white tile with brown tile square frames. In the nursery, I see a pile of old clothes of mine I'd forgotten to move into my house. I start to go through them, finding pieces I remembered I liked. Ellie is here. Then I find a pile of little kittens and dogs that had been there for a long time. I feel badly because they've been forgotten and hadn't had food or water for too long. One little kitten's paws are deformed and they are weakened. I gather them up and take them outside. I suggest to Ellie she take the littlest kitten. She'd rather take one not so bad off, one of the white ones. I get annoyed and insist she take the littlest one. Outside, my mother pours water into a bowl and I put the kitties near it so they can drink. One puppy lies on my lap, a golden cocker spaniel type. I pet it and say, "This one likes that. She could stay forever like this. I've got a friend for life." Then the puppy is a child with a British accent. I ask how long she's been abandoned by her parents. "Eleven days," she says. I ask her if she wants to get back with them. She says, "Oh, yes." I say, OK, we'll work on that."
