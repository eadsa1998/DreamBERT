I was walking along a secluded path in the woods, with a high hill along one side, and dense forest on the other. I was conscious of the beauty of the surroundings. After walking for awhile, I came to a brook, stopped to take a drink, crossed the beach and walked onward. As it started to grow dark, I turned back, but had forgotten something (what I don't know) and returned for it. Something happened to frighten me, and I ran as hard and fast as I could homeward. I never actually saw anything to cause my fear, but I am distinctly aware of that fear in my dream, and I was still unexplainably frightened when I awoke.
