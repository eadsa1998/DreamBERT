We were being pursued. I seemed to be the pursuer and also the pursued. We were overtaken. I slipped and fell. we were on a trip with Carter. Denny walked away, so we took off. We intended to give him a scare. As we were waiting by a light, he ran and caught up with us. A fellow with a big cart bumped the side of my car. I went out and it had a few dents in it, and it seemed to be old and dilapidated. We went to receptions of deaths in PA. I tried to park my car on top of a hill, but the brakes wouldn't hold and it wouldn't hold in gear either. I was working in the shop nude. Charlotte was working there again, so I looked for my clothes to put on. I took a dive and then was flying low, about a foot or two above the street. A fellow said, "That's the way you fly so the cops can't shoot you."
