I saw Vince P. I said something to him about him not returning my last calls or responding to my last cards or letters. I asked him if he was going to finally tell me what was going on and why he hadn't responded. He said he was. He told me why and I can't remember now. [This upsets me very much that I can't remember what he said. I would really like to know what has prevented him from responding when we used to be very close friends.] It was such a simple, little thing. It was based on a misunderstanding.
