I remember these dreams in continuity, but only relative to each other. When I think deep enough about one, it triggers associations with the ones around it. And when I remember a recent dream, I tend to remember other past dreams a lot more than usual. The dream connected to the dream with family in it was next to one where I was at a resort town in Thailand. It was packed, and I was trying to find a place to stay. The only hotels available were attached to the big mega firm in the city. It had two units. Near the main road, with the front facing a street lit up with many glowing orange lights and manicured trees, busy out front with lots of people running around and taxis and cars. The front was ornately built to resemble old Chinese palaces. I walked past, knowing the clientele of this building would be very wealthy and out of my league. Like women who wear pearls. The time frame seemed to shift. But I went to the club/bar behind the main building. It was an area I knew better. From my approach, I'd never even seen the front of that main building before until now, and I feel like I'd been here before. I met some other travelers in the bar. We conspired to just find a room with an open door and walk in. We did. It was on a top floor. I remember the elevator went up. Most of them got off on preceding floors. The numbers, glowing on the panel., went up to at least 10. I got off on 10. I went into the darkened room and remember feeling a thrill of getting away with something.
