I had this horrible dream that we were playing a hockey game. Our third line (my line) was completely out of it, and we just couldn't play. One girl was missing from the first line, so Chloe moved me up to play with them --big mistake! They were much faster and more skilled than I. I would try to pass the puck, and they'd be gone from the space I'd passed to. I couldn't position myself correctly because they would always skate away. Finally the game ended; we had won, and Chloe and Mrs. Carter were thrilled. Everyone then left and I was alone on the bench. Then all the lights went out. I began to take off my equipment right then and there. Doing so, I managed to lose my gloves, pants, and skates. When I finally had put what was remaining of my equipment into my bag, I assumed that my skates had somehow magically been transported to the locker room. I must have started a new dream, because next thing I know I am talking to Anthony. And it's weird because I know somewhere in the back of my mind that he's dead. But I kept talking to him. I was so sad because he was dead. But then I woke up.
