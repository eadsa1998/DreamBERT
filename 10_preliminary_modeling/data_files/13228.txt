I went back in time to when I was in pre-primary. I went back and was actually myself at that age. I still had my memory though. I was doing extremely well in all the work, even more so than I did the first time. I asked where people were on September 11, then remembered that hadn't happened yet. This teacher was going to make us read this book out one at a time. I hesitated and some other girl got made to do it first. Then I remembered it had happened before and I realized that stuff would stay the same even if I didn't do them, ie, I was worried about having to redo all of Runescape, but it was going to happen even without me playing. Evelyn was there and she wanted to talk on my mobile. I said they were banned and she said they weren't. I pulled it out and it was this big brick thing and I was saying how my real one was much smaller. I didn't let her use it. Someone was handing out work and Raquel was there. Some guy was called Eugene, but it was spelt "Micheal". I was then thinking about Eugene. It was then Year 8 and I was at Brookland. I saw Eugene and he was in the senior school uniform. He was talking to Autumn and Alejandro. Autumn jumped on Alejandro. This teacher told me to smile, as did these two guys. She said that was why I had no friends. I was doing really well at school.
