I'm in an English class. Bonnie is with me. I leave the class and bus somewhere to find this professor to ask him to lecture at the OCA conference. He seems reluctant and I continue to press. He finally agrees. I bus back and almost pick up another girl's homework paper. I tell her she left them behind. She's grumpy and doesn't care.
