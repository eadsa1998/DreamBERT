I was planning on going to a costume party. I had given the kind of costume that I was to wear much thought. I met someone I knew, who was also going to the same party and she asked me what I was going as. I told her that I would dress as a game of bridge. At that moment, hundreds of people appeared from nowhere, and all shouting at once, stated that they were going as a game a bridge also. They didn't seem to mind that they would all look alike but it disturbed me greatly.
