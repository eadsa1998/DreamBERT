I was in a car with Mom, Darren and Ezra. Ezra was using my iPod because I had a heap of songs from this new R&amp;B singer guy that I didn't like. Two Princes came on the radio and Darren was like 'Oh my God, I love this song!'. We dropped Ezra off. Darren had a shirt that Dad had. Then it was like a dream I've had before and no-one could touch anyone. I was with Eugene and a guy and a girl. There were zombie things too. There weren't many though. We went to this shed building. It had lots of floors and every one was the same and empty. It swayed too. The floors were just big rooms. We picked a floor and we lied down to sleep. Eugene and I slept next to each other, as we always did, and wore gloves and were completely covered in case we touched. This lady and son had something to do with it and they wanted to start it up again (it was like on a farm and it produced something?). They saw us and gave us food and it was weird and squishy and in balls. They gave us fruit too (lots of fruit). The guy was weird looking but I thought he looked a little like Michael Palin. Eugene and I never said we liked each other, but we and everyone else knew we did. One day I somehow fell off a cliff and he grabbed my hand and pulled me up. We looked at each other and realized we were ok and then we started making out.
