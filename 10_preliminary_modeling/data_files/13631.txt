I was somewhere and I was dying of thirst. I was trying to get in the McDonald's drive thru, but cars kept coming. A lady helped me pull myself behind her. I was then in a car with Mom and we asked for water. The girl was going to give me two cones. One was with chocolate and ice-cream and the other one wasn't. I was like 'what the hell?'. They had this big fancy chocolate thing which was $900. Mom said that there was a gas leak or something. I asked how she knew and she just stared at me. This brother and sister, who liked each other, had died on this evil Ferris wheel thing. I had warned them before they went on it. This lady had kids that looked exactly the same.
