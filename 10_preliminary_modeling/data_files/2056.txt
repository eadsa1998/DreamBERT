I am in my room. It is small and beautiful. The curtains have stars and moons on them, symbols of the cosmos. There is a typewriter. It seems to be a room for spirituality and writing. It is cozy and just right. John, a co-worker, comes in to give me a message. He seems nervous and klutzy. He'd knock over some papers and then have trouble getting them put back together. The roles were reversed. I was relaxed and calm and tried to soothe and reassure him. I leave the room. I see a huge, beautiful crystal on a table near my door. I admire it. Bonnie is there. Then Nate comes in. I am so glad to see him. We look at each other longingly. Bonnie goes and gets the van. She drives. Nate and I hug and lay down on the bench. It is so sexually exciting. I am throbbing in anticipation, but worried about if he has AIDS, is he still married, and is he still an alcoholic? We talk. Then we're at the movie house. It's the same one we were last together at. We enter through tiny door holes in the wall. Bonnie and Nate go ahead. I enter and see racked seating and can't locate them in the crowd. Then I see Bonnie waving at me. I'd walked too far in, so I back track and go to them. She was seated next to him but moves over so I sit beside him, between them.
