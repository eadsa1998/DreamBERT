There was a short circuit in a high school where I was a student. The boys were playing games and were getting shocked and sparks and flashes were coming up thru the ground. I called Illuminating Co. and a man came and I told him where it was and he seemed not to believe me. Then more men came and checked it, but didn't seem to find it. I had a dream that wild bull won and paid a bundle. Some woman told me she had a 71 to 1 in a race and she thought he wouldn't win. He didn't get a first, but was a winner. I borrowed a pencil from a student, then gave it back. I said I had one in my desk.
