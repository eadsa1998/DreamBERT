I went to some event thing with Dad. We left in his car although we had gone there in mine. I asked 'what about my car?' and I text Mom to ask if we could pick it up tonight. I was annoyed because I had almost finished my logbook. We got back home which was a bit different. This creepy guy came to the door and told me to come with him. I did and jokingly asked "I don't have to get in the back seat of your car do I?". There was a car across the road that was normal looking it was red on the side and black everywhere else. He told me to look inside and I saw my car keys (although I had them on me too) and other stuff of mine. He said that it was for me. It turned out that it was because Bret Michaels was related to us. His son, Eugene, looked like him but was uglier and they had only recently found out that they were related, which led them to finding out about me. Then he wasn't Bret but was some other rich guy/explorer. We were in a room with some others and he gave a speech and said that most of us would get money from him, but some wouldn't. He said that the first $500,000 was over there and he pointed to my car. There was a party game, where you did an 'evil' stare at people and if your eyes glinted, the person you looked at 'died'. You had to be drunk from a certain drink though and I wasn't drunk, but I played anyway. When I went out later some of the red paint came off. Poppa was around as well and I felt kind of bad because of my old car. I was driving the new car and there was no lag when taking off and it was really comfy etc. There were bad guys after the famous guy and he grabbed his daughter (who was me at this point and was a toddler). He ran up a lot of stairs which were gate like. He got to the top and then his son Eugene who was still the same age, was puffed out. There was a trolley and someone asked "why isn't this running?" and then jumped down.
