 I am in a snow-covered yard talking with my friend Ivory Alshire. There are sexual overtones. I walk away with a small leaf-less branch poking in the snow. I go to my neighbors, the Stein's, front yard. I approach three people to talk, one of whom is a college classmate Brad Chloe. Parked on the street is a white Cadillac, with two carpeted armchairs as seats in the front. It is my friend's mother, Patty Yams' car. I find this out be asking my friend Matt Yams, who is there. Matt's brother Jasper is driving. Jasper is walking down the street in a short-sleeved white shirt and tie, in the winter! It is slippery and slushy, with lots of snow on the ground. The car is parked on the west side of Home Ave, facing north. As a result, when Jasper pulls awake, he has to cross a lane of oncoming traffic to get to the right lane. I am in the car. We move slowly. It is slippery. It is dangerous because a car may appear suddenly over the hill in front of us and not be able to stop in time. We are all in a van, like a chicken catching van. I talk to Jasper about having sex. He says he doesn't have sex.
