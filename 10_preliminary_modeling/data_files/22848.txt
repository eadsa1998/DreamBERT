I am in jail.  It's sort of like a cafeteria, with an aisle along one wall, and a turnstile.  I don't know why I am there, but I am very angry and distressed on account of the various procedures they have to go through with which I am completely unfamiliar.  Finally, before going to bed (I guess) for the night, the head guy asks if there are any questions.  I stand up and start to tell him all about why I am there.  (There is some good legitimate reason.) and why, "just because all these other people are more familiar with a jail"-a sarcastic statement which I was quite proud of-I shouldn't  be subjected to all these silly procedures.  But when I try to talk, even though it is silent in the room, it is like trying to make myself heard in a football stadium full of screaming people-I just can't get any volume out of my voice.  He says I can tell him the next day.  I almost accept this, but go ahead and finally succeed in getting my point across, I think.
