 I explain to my mom and my uncle Rusty Redding what happened to my friend Kevin Simpson and his living arrangements. I tell them briefly that he got kicked out and is living in his truck. They seem concerned, so I elaborate: four men moved into the house without signing a lease because Kevin's father didn't have a renter's license because he wanted to evade taxes. Then Jose Ramos left, so Kevin's father Dilbert evicted the rest of them. I portray Dilbert as a greedy, unloving father. My dad is there. He says he is very proud of my siblings and I for the way we act. He says he's embarrassed of his own actions when compared to ours: we are caring, selfless, compassionate, and loving. I hug him, and we cry. I say I love him very much and that he means a lot to my siblings and I. He seems to be feeling belittled when compared with his kids, but we don't think so, and tell him this.
