I am in bed asleep. It is a small, narrow room. Ellie is asleep in a single bed across the room facing me. Theresa (client) sleeps on the floor by my bedside. [drawing is shown in journal.] She wants to be comforted. (Theresa slowly slinks up into my bed, hoping I won't wake up and throw her out. I am very aware that we are both naked and am concerned because it is not proper to let your client sleep with you. But I also am aware of her childlike need for comfort. I feel the softness of our skin touching and wonder if this will be sexual. But it doesn't feel that way. I pat her curly hair and arrange a barrette, thinking maybe no one will find out. I let her sleep (all the time I was pretending to be asleep myself).
