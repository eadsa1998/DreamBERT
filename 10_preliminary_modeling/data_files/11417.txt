I was in a small classroom with some students from my chemistry section; however the class seemed to be in French. We were given forms to be filled out for a student who was majoring in psychology. They were obviously a part of an experiment or project. We were to fill out these forms with the first thing that came to our minds, and we were working against a few-minute time limit. I couldn't think of a thing to write. Even after everyone turned his form in I still had mine and tried to fill it out but with little success. The words that I did put down didn't seem to form sentences and they were all simple words like cat, it, etc. The professor seemed to be one of the male faculty of the WRU romance languages department who I had met once but who had never been one of my professors. One girl of the class was very outstanding in my mind. The rest of the class I couldn't recognize, but I assumed they were in my chemistry section due to the presence of the girl. That girl wore large shining glasses.
