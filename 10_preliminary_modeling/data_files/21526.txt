Joe Lasko was talking to me into my ear and hugging me, but I couldn't see him. He told me how much he loved me. I asked him a question how I could get rich and Ann and I would be happy, but he wouldn't answer. Bob was sleeping on the floor. I told him to sleep on the bed, and when he saw the bed, he went for it. He was sleeping next to Grandpa Lasko and he was snoring. I was playing some kind of game. I got a rubber ball. I bounced it against the wall and it kept bouncing till it stopped, but Albert came by and stopped it. I yelled at him to keep his hand off, but he didn't and I threw a peach at him, hitting him on the head. The flattened peach fell on the ground and the ball was also a flattened peach. There were 3 balls to choose from a box and the game cost 40 cents. I said all I would play was one ball. Famous Gift came to me in my sleep.
