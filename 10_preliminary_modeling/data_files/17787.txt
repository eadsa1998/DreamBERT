I was in PE in 7th grade.  My mother picked me up and we were going to leave after she talked to someone, but we ended up staying.  Synesthesia was the topic of Oprah, so we were going to stay and watch.  My brother Stuart was there too, I think.  My mother was babysitting a little kid in diapers.  For some reason the diapers weren't all that effective and poop started to run down the kid's leg, and it smelled.  I was frustrated about what they were saying on Oprah and I wanted to call in and clarify some things.
