[1997-05-14] I was in a building working as a counselor. It seemed to be a very brightly lit office. A student came in who had a problem with drugs and I handed him his folder, it was the same kind of folder that we use for our vocational rehab cases and I remember picking it up with my right hand and I opened it and the client looked at it and somehow there were dog biscuits in it, I don't understand that, or maybe there were like edible biscuits for people, mixed up with the case so I really didn't understand it and the principal of the school where we were said that the student, the client could just read his folder and put it back and he would be all better, so I said okay and we let the student be his own counselor and somehow he looked at his folder and said "okay, I'll be all right now".
