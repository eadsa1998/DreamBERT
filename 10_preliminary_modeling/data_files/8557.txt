I am in my dentist office. We are sitting in chairs across from each other talking, but I don't know what about. He's leaning way back in his chair. We're sitting fairly close together, with maybe just 2-3 feet between us. I'm sitting in a regular office guest chair and he is sitting in an office desk chair without arms. I'm wondering if I should really be talking to him about this, questioning his credibility on the subject. Then I think, Oh. But being a dentist he is a medical doctor too, just like psychiatrists are. So I relax and finish the conversation.
