I build a tiny room behind another room to hide in. Capt. Kirk and Spock are looking for me. They are in their private office and Capt. K sees a seam on the wall that is part of my hidden room. He says to Spock, "This room seems different, smaller, and I don't remember that seam there." I realize then they'd found me. I feel caught. Kirk says, "Do you think she knows we know?" Spock says, "She knew the moment you knew. Ann is very smart, as smart as you." They leave the room to give me some private time.
