In penitentiary for few months for legal offense. Jailer, rather heavy-set, says he has vacancy but it would be inappropriate for me to apply for it seeing I'm a prisoner. Mention Ph. D. (This had been granted preceding August and I was really looking for a position.) He assigns me to making a mimeograph. Is called away. I hunt for (?) in desk. Lift lid and look in five drawers at side of desk, find nothing but tumbled papers, look again. Go to beds at side of room, pull one open. It has wet flannel sheet. Smell disgusting. Several people in room but none clear.
