I forgot about The Oscars and I woke up as they were announcing 'Best Supporting Actor'. An actor announced it and the winner was Geoffrey Rush. A woman I'd never heard of announced 'Best Director' and 'Best Picture' which were both the same and it was a lame 'cartoon' [like, new cartoons] sequel. I also announced an award.
