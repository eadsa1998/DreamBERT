I was in a restaurant or caf√© of some sort, which seemed almost like it was in a cave.  I'm not sure what was going on, but everyone was looking for a safe place because the lights were going to fall.  Eventually we got out.  I remember standing in the middle of a place; maybe a dimly lit mall, with some friends, including my longtime classmate Ralph.  I felt depressed.  My friends were talking and I just said it felt empty.  Something was missing.  I looked into my boyfriend Jeremy's eyes.  He tried to comfort me and put an arm around me, and started to lead me away from the group.  Just then my elementary school classmate Becky approached the group.  I said I was just tired as I was leaving.  Becky said she was tired too and asked me to get Bugs Bunny.  I didn't look back and raised my right fist.  I nearly flipped her off.  Jeremy told me I should, and I said I wanted to.  Later on we were all on a plane, and I was still unhappy.  There was a woman who looked something like a woman from choir, and she seemed concerned for me.  I asked her why, and she told me to talk to her on the console, so I turned to the console in front of me; everyone seemed to have one.  I asked her why she cared, though I don't remember getting an answer.
