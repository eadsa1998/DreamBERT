J got in line first and I second for tickets for the boat ride. Others came. H or R told us it was 12 cents to ride out to the ship. She told us how to go to the pier. We waited a long time and I sat down in a chair. At last the man came and said we need to pay now but finally said the 12 cents would clinch the bargain for the longer ride. H paid him for her two daughters and husband. When I started to the pier, I missed my brown handbag. Where had I had it last? It was Sunday at church.
