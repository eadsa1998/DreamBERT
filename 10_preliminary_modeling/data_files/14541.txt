There were heaps of seasons of Battlestar Galactica. Roslin found out she was a Cylon (one of the final five). They took her down to a planet, on a train without telling her. She was upset. Ezra was watching an episode and there was a black guy on the outside of something that I can't read (it looks like it starts with an 's'). I asked "Is that Sam Anders?" and then it had a picture of him. He had a ball with shapes on it and it was gold and was like a quidditch ball (the little flying thingy). Also, I had done something with some people. We were in a building and there was a TV and Eugene was there. He was listening to AC/DC and watching nature documentaries and I said "you're like my Mom". Calvin was there too. It looks like it says 'at the end', but it says there was a photo of us and a cutout and Eugene wasn't in it. I was watching 24. Jack and Aaron were climbing up a hill and they needed to warn people about something.
