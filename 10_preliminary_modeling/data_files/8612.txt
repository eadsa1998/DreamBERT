Again with the Excel sheets. and American Idol. This time, however, I can't say that I was specifically involved. It doesn't even necessarily feel that I was. The images I have are of the Excel sheets and the Idol judges. There are several columns set up for criteria for judging the contestants and several rows of information for each contestant. One section of the sheet was highlighted in pale green.
