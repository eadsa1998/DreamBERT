I dreamed that Jafar (from Aladdin) had captured me and was taking over my high school. It was really scary. He told me that the only way I would live is if I made out with Ray Romano, from Everybody Loves Raymond. I can't remember if I did or not, but I knew I had to get a haircut too. Then I woke up.
