 I'm at the public library. I leave the library and see I have a parking ticket for $69 for having a gang-related bumper sticker on the car. The sticker covered up a Pizza Pub bumper sticker I had on. I was in the library for only a short time. The meter was paid for 20 minutes too. I know that the bumper sticker wasn't on the bumper earlier, because I looked. Someone must have put the sticker on when I was in the library. I am going to fight the ticket; I should not have to pay. I had nothing to do with the offensive or illegal sticker on my bumper.
