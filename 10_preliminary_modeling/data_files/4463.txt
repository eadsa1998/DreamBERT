["Bonnie calls on her friends."] Bonnie needs help and she calls on her friends to come and help. I feel frustrated and don't really want to go help. I go and Bonnie is a bit upset with me for not being happy to help. A man named Carlos is there helping her learn how to drive. He is in the passenger seat and they hug as I watch.
