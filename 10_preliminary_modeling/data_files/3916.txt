["Mateo and School Work."] I am lying down resting and Mateo is doing some school work. Some man is watching. Now I have to go pee and I get up and find a restroom. I go in and see that there are no regular toilets. Only little short baby potty chairs. I have a hard time squatting down over one but manage and pee for some time. I pick up the potty and pour the thick yellow smelly urine into another container which flushes as it gets full. I am now gathering up Mateo's school work to return to him and some of my things. I change clothes. It is a lot to carry.
