 I'm in a restaurant with my friend from Brimson Beth Mock. There is a police officer or a security guard there. Someone we know works at the restaurant. Beth has a glass of water. I get a glass of soda. There is talk about something, which we don't want. We leave. Beth's mother is there, and gives Beth a nearly empty bottle of Sam Adams Boston Lager.
