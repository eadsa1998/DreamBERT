In the first part of the dream I was in a men's clothing store in my hometown looking for a rain coat. The only rain coat the salesman was able to show me was one made of woven straw and with isinglass panels on the upper part of the sleeves. I didn't buy the coat because both of the panels were cracked and I could image that the coat wouldn't last long. However, the price tempted me since it was only $5.30. The salesman began to tell me about his boss who was very disagreeable, tight and whenever he spoke the whole store smelled like sauerkraut. His boss broke up our conversation and I left the store. After I left I met most of the members of the Reserve football team. We walked down the street together until we came to an intersection. On the opposite corner was Harry Truman and in the adjacent corner was a friendly policeman. The football players couldn't catch the ball. I could. President Truman reported the friendly policeman to the chief of police for not staying on duty. We were all very disgusted.
