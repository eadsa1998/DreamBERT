Sondra from IHC called me and asked me again to come in for an interview. When I got there, there were several other people in the reception area waiting for an interview for the same position. She was fussing over me being the ideal candidate. She finally took me back to Scott M's office for my interview and was going on to him about how I was the perfect candidate. We were talking about how I excel in operational issues and the connection between my studies and their purpose.
