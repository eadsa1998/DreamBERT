Last night I recall a dream that I have had often. I'm always the hero. In this particular dream I was at a nightclub. There were many beautiful women. I was dancing and having a good time when this shady-looking dude walks in. I distinctly remember noticing him for a minute and then going back to my partying. I got a beautiful blonde to dance with me. As we were dancing the shady-looking guy grabbed my woman and put a gun to her head. Everyone was screaming and none of the bouncers would do anything. At one point the guy took the gun away from her head and pointed it in the air. In that instant I jumped at him and knocked him down. I took the gun. The blonde was so grateful and was all over me. I can remember all the other girls watching and wanting me, grabbing me. It was great and then I woke up.
