The characters from Friends were on holidays. They were in an auditorium thing which had a stage. Someone was gay. Jeff from Community was there and had a brother. Then they were at a house. Monica and Chandler had started seeing each other secretly and had slept together. They were kissing in a walk-in cupboard and the others walked in and caught them and Monica freaked out but they were all cool with it. They walked across train tracks and one was 'open' and the other had a train slowly coming. Then they were at some place and Chandler and I had organised the luggage. We put water bottles in the cupboard. Some girl was with us and we had to hide her. Someone was looking for her and I said I couldn't find her "there are like 50 girls wearing white singlets" but she decided to look anyway. The girl out of the little building thing she was hiding in and into some animal clinic.
