I am at a spiritual woman's house. I am lying on a couch and she's seated in a chair behind my head. She's talking into a tape recorder. I hear noise outside the house but ignore it. Then our session is over and I get up and go to the front door to look out. I see bushes across the road burning and her front garden and lawn has been flooded. The water hose is still on. I say, "Those vandals I heard about on the news were here! I'd best call the police. They've ruined your garden." She goes out to look. I call the police. I dial "0" and ask for the police. They are on the line very quickly. I say, "My name is Barb Sanders and I'm at...." "Hey," I yell to her, "What's your address here?" She tells me and I tell them. Then I describe the damage. I say, "You can even see their footprints." I hang up and wait for them. Then I hear her out there cleaning up the mess. I go out and say, "Don't do that. You'll ruin the evidence. You'll cover it up." I am concerned. I decide to go home. She gives me the tape of our session and says, "Don't work on this tonight. You've worked hard enough today." I say "OK. Maybe I'll just listen to it once." I smile because I realize I still intend to work on it. Then I look around for my car. I can't see it anywhere. I say, "Wouldn't I have parked it close to the house, so I wouldn't walk so far?" She walks up the side yard to look. I say, "Wait! Now when the police get here all they'll see is yours and my footprints!" [BL]
