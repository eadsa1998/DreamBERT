       Earlier in Church: I sit on the side, near the altar. Father Andrew is on the other side before the service starts; I go up and fix up a display of pictures; they are made of a Lego set; then see Father Andrew who asks me if he can have a green candle in a dish. "I made it," I say; "I'll pay you for it." "No you can have it." -- I run along a stone floor very quickly and then up to the Choir loft, where we begin to sing. They welcome me and make room for me. <br/
