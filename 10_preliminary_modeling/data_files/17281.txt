We found another digital camera.  We were going to figure out which was better and keep it but had forgotten about the other.  So we pulled it out again and started fooling with it.  Somehow this led to me walking into the my parents' bathroom as a guy, holding a round disk like our window shades, and letting the urine roll off of it into the toilet.  Some spray got onto the walls and I had to clean it up.  I found a piece of poop there too; I didn't touch that one.  Then I took a shower.
