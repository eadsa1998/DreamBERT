I was in a restaurant with the fellow I was going with at the time. We were with another couple our own age whom we doubled with and my next door neighbors (ages in their 40's). We were waiting to be waited on. When the waitress came, she asked us two girls to write down our ages on the check--even though we weren't ordering liquor, only ice cream. The other girl wrote down "twenty," but everyone knew it meant twenty-one. I wrote down twenty-one, but felt ashamed because it wasn't true. My date was angry with me. Despite the fact that he didn't say anything, I knew how he felt.
