I was with the cast of Red Dwarf in a basement place, which had quite a few levels. I saw this guy's head pop out from somewhere and I said "It's the 217 guy!". He opened this door, which led outside, and told us to go outside. It was Earth. I said that I should stay, but I didn't. We didn't walk too far and there was another door, on the left side of the path. As I went to go in, it started to close and I made it through, but Kryten was left behind. I had to run across this dodgy bridge and then I was standing with Rimmer, who had screwed up his line (which was something about Lister). People started walking towards us over this oval. There was this girl and Rimmer ran to her saying "Shamara!" and hugged her and she was confused about it. Poppa, Dad and Mom came, along with various other people I knew. It wasn't real though.
