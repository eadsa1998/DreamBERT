We were writing scripts and stuff to get selected. People were calling out the name of their script and others voted on whether they liked it or not. Claudine wrote a script called The Last Stand and everyone loved it. Jolene's was also popular and we were sure her's would get picked. Another class come in and Cecelia was there. There was this studio room and they were getting people to go in for each role to select them for each script. They were going to pick four and Tristan said there were too many people. Also Fletcher was hanging around us and being normal and I was glad that he wasn't acting weird.
