My boss, Yale, about 30, was clad in his undershorts. He was cutting Jean's hair. Jean is the other girl who works in my office. She is engaged and very, very righteous and completely lacks a sense of humor. I spilled a bottle of Ruth's cologne. Ruth is Yales's wife, and the cologne was slowly dripping down the sides of the dresser on to the floor. I was not afraid that Ruth would be angry at me, but I was very frightened that Yale would be angry with me for my carelessness. Their little girl, Dibby, was there but she was playing on the floor and didn't figure into the dream.
