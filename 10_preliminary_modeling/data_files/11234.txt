I was on board a train that was moving very slowly through Cleveland. I could see the buildings and streets, although it was night outside and there seemed to be no streetlights on anywhere. I kept trying to open a window because my girlfriend was walking along beside the train, and I wanted to help her get on. The train never seemed to leave the station, which was on the order of a small town's loading platform. Yet I saw the scenery moving by. I kept struggling with the window and couldn't budge it.
