I was evidently living in a strange apartment. And across from mine, lived my girlfriend, age 21, and her husband, age 21. She came over to see me and we talked for quite a while. Hearing a lot of noise, J looked out and saw a football game going on. It was a college game and we were living on a campus. The scene changed and I was on a farm. There was a storm coming up and I had to go out to the barn to do something (I didn't know exactly what it was) to protect the animals from the storm.
