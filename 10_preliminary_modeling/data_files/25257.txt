 I'm at my orthodontist's office to get my lower retainer out. My orthodontist says he won't take it out. I am furious! I yell at him, saying that I am the patient, and that he should do what I request! I also say that I have a wire that is poking out of a gash in my finger. This is what I want fixed. [Note: I had an orthodontist appointment 7/30/1996]
