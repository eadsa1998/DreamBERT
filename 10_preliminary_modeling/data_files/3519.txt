I am driving a car up a windy mountain road and park it next to my father's car as he was coming down the road. We are way off in the hills where scruffy hillbilly people live. I see an old rundown house and remark, "I've seen this kind of house before, as in my childhood, maybe living in them." I go in and a man and a woman, the sister to the woman who lives in the house, is being critical and judgmental. She doesn't like the way her sister does things and is telling her. The sister is angry and not responsive. I act as a negotiator and say to the sister "Look, you hit first. So of course, she has to hit back." The sister doesn't understand that her negative critical remarks are as harsh as attacking physically.
