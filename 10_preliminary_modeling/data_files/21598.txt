I was in Chester's car and the to or roof of his car was high like a bus. I was in the house in Rivertown and it was night. The door seemed to be open and I thought it was closed before. I told Andy P., "Let's go into the room and see if anyone came in." I looked in from behind the doorway and saw no one, so I walked in and Andy behind me. We looked behind the furniture and saw no one. I came to the window in the shop and looked out to see if a fellow's car parked outside. I came to work and Eddie K. came in also on the same shift. I was working at White's again. As I lay thinking who was going to win the 7th race, I saw a 6 on a horse. I came home by Grandma's and she gave me some food to eat. Someone was given a present. I heard singing a couple of times or it was music.
