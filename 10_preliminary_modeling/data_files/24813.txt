All I remember was coming out of some building with Haley and seeing this hella cool car (some little cute red sports car) and then my mom gets out. My friend and I were like, "Oh, my god!" and I asked my mom "Where'd you get that car?" and she goes, "On 19th and Sutter. I couldn't find our car so I took this one." So my friend and I said "cool" and jumped into the car. Then I woke up. Setting: Somewhere like San Francisco. It was outside with a lot of cars on the sidewalk. Characters: Haley is one of my best friends. My mom is my mom, but she would never do something like that. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy. Wow! It was weird cuz my mom or I wouldn't act like that, but Haley might have.
