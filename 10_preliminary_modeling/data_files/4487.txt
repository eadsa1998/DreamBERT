["Doing the dishes at family reunion."] I had bussed to the family reunion for the Sanders's. Aunt Naomi had driven down the night before to accompany me. She had wanted to party with me but I got busy packing and getting ready. I regret not taking the time to party with her. She drove her car and followed the bus I was on. Now I am in a large dining hall. My cousin is having difficulty getting his food and cleaning up the table he is seated at. I decide to help him. I walk back and forth from the table to the sink carrying dirty dishes. It is piled high at the sink with dirty dishes. I decide to wash them all to make room for more food coming in as more family arrive. There are double metal sinks, very deep. A woman cousin like Patricia comes by to bring more dishes. I wash and wash dish after dish. Bowls, silverware mostly. More female cousins come in and ask me did I enjoy Naomi's visit. I express my regret at not taking the time to have more fun and visit with her more.
