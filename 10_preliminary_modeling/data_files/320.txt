I'm somewhere with my brother and another guy, friend of his, in (perhaps) an office building, we're talking, occasionally I look out the windows and see the place next door. It has some signs on it, it might be a store or something, well known to us. [This is an old-fashioned place, these buildings are maybe from the 30's, 40's, 50's, 2-3 stories, brick.] Just now I seem to think my view of the building next door is moving, sliding sideways. That can't be right. I look away again for a bit, then back, and it still looks different. I look away again and take part in the conversation, but a minute or so later when we look again, the building's gone. We jump up and run to the window, and see that it's being hauled off by a truck. [It's just been hitched up to a cab like a giant trailer, and pulled away as if from a parking space.] I'm amazed, but my brother is very disturbed. He's sure it's being stolen - he runs out, going after it, I guess [or to call the cops], shouting behind him for us not to drive his car. His vintage car is here [something big and bulbous from the 40's, early 50's, he's restored it, it's quite a prize], and he's very touchy about other people handling it, even me and his best friend here. Well, this best friend of his (reminds me of the kid from the Pepsi commercials) is the let's-do-it, impetuous type, and he says, let's go after it in the car. I'm dubious, but likewise I think we should do something, and while I have lots of misgivings about this guy's driving, well, better him than me if anything happens. We take off.
