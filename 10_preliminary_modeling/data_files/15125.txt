It was like Civilisation IV. I decided to build a city, except it was more like a cottage next to a road. Then Ezra and I were in a car there at night. I plugged a cord into a power point on a pole. We parked under the street light. I put the seat down and tried to sleep. Ezra heard a noise. There was a dark house behind us and there were bushes rustling. I turned the car on (it was a US car) and drove around and chased some guy. Then we were walking and Rover was with us. A lady from the house was near our car and let us in. Rover wandered out and I couldn't find Ezra. I went in and realized they were dodgy and ran. I picked up some thin sticks. We were together again and went back, but nothing was there. Eventually we realized we were trapped there. My tooth was wobbly and I pulled it out. There was a young cheerleader girl. A guy who looked like Michael Cera was also in the first season of Arrested Development and he wanted to lose his virginity. An older lady said she'd do it. Then a guy at some place took this girl into his room and told her to do something and she was allowed to wish for something. He had sex with two women and at the end cried out "Oh shit! Fuck!". The girl said she wished to see a movie tonight with something that I can't remember. She got us our car back? The cheerleader went back to school. They were from the olden days or something.
