Our yard at my hometown is rather unkempt. Cal Carty had started to mow it and the strips he had already cut were plainly visible next to alley and also in back yard. Between alley and house was a small rectangular flower bed, largely planted to roses. The rose bushes had originally been planted in oblique rows of 3 bushes each but in some way the bushes had moved sufficiently to make the rows transverse, and the bushes badly crowded. The plant marked "R.S" was a rose of Sharon bush, about knee high, with several pink blooms. It had grown from a sprout. This plant (or possibly one of the others) was supported by a tall, black, iron pipe. The rose bed was full of a coarse grass. As I started to dig out this grass I found the soil exceedingly flaky and easy to work. In cellar of house there was another similar flower bed. The further end (end towards east) of this bed was protected from dog urine by a flat piece of metal, standing on its edge and reaching from side to side of the bed. This metal seemed to be a piece of some article (possibly a gas stove). It was bluish and marbled, like a certain kind of enamelware. My old trunk, containing several cardboard boxes, standing on top of one another, was somewhere nearby. The top box contained my good, winter suit. After taking the coat out, I replaced it, but then found the trunk wouldn't close properly. By moving the trunk lid up and down several times the boxes were caused to settle into their correct positions, on which the trunk lid closed easily.
