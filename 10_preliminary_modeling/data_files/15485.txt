I was at home, but it was a new house. We used to have an outside fridge which I had lollies and other things in. It was gone now, but Mom had just moved the lollies which I later found in the lounge room. Granma came in and I said "oh... hi" and she mumbled unhappily about it. There was a picture of Chris Colfer on display, as well as many others. She asked 'do you think that guy is gay' and I didn't know which picture she meant and then when I realised I said yeah and said that we met him, then he kept being over all the time but I wasn't inviting him over (Mom was). She made a joke that he was dating Ezra. I remembered a video I'd made with Cory Monteith talking to me as I filmed it. This guy was in love with a rat. It got hurt and he was angry at it. It could talk and stuff, but it was a bit weird. The rat crawled to the door and he told me to close it. I got a person to say these 'dying words' and the door opened and it died. He put it in his pocket and we tried to convince him to remember another way.
