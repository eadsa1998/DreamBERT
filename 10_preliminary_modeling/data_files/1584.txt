I'm walking down a long muddy lane. I keep seeing chains of different kinds and notice that they are malicious and one wraps around my left ankle and I pull it off. There is danger. I keep walking and then see a college. I wonder which one it is. Some man says the name of a prestigious school. Then I see a sign, "the Kennedy Center for Turkey Runs (or Farms)." I start laughing. People walk by me and I try to hide my giggles so as not to offend them.
