Another boy and myself were roommates. We had the room in a very neat condition. One day we were going on a picnic with my parents and some friends. We decided to take the portable television set along. When we came back from the picnic, we had a hard time getting the television set up the stairs. When my roommate and I entered the bedroom we found two other couples there. They had the room all messed up. The two girls were lying in bed. We told them we would try to repair the television set so that they could see a good picture. In the meantime, the people with whom we had gone to the picnic were waiting in the car. Finally my father got very angry and came upstairs and started throwing things around. After we explained our trouble with the TV set, he sort of quieted down and we all went out to the car.
