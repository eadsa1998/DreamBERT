We are going some place. Baby been very eager to go. We were dressing. I was to move room. Came into J's. It was very much littered with children's toys. Look as if some of missing toys are in toy box. Think I see my Tibetan idol there but it isn't; only some long carved wooden dolls. My steamer trunk is closed. I close drawers. After we set out I wonder if windows are closed in J's room. Decide I did leave them up far enough. The baby id laughing and running. I am climbing a steep hill. As I reach P., I ask man ahead of me for help and he helps me up to the last bit. As I attain summit I say to the man, "I'll be afraid to go down." Then we start on in opposite direction from where we cam and find a rough path leading down a small grade between high rocks and cliffs that turns in almost horseshoe bends. The man leaps down on the path below but I cautiously follow the long bend, it is very rocky. The summit was bare but trees are more numerous as we descend.
