I have some land and I want a fence to mark a small portion of it off to garden since I'm going to have to rely on myself. I might as well use the land to feed myself. I ask this man how much he'd charge to do a wire and wood post fence. He says 25 dollars. I say OK. Now I'm walking past my neighbor, and see them cutting down a tree and see they are pruning branches that sprout from a large trunk stump. I think it will be nice when I have trees growing on my land. It's so new still. Then I see the fences are up and I am not pleased. He's used tall burnt trees or poles and strung wire on them way too tall and the burnt wood is fragile. And I only wanted the one fence, not two lines of them. I complain to him and he agrees to cut them into shorter fences so they are more usable for me. Now I am in the house. There is no furniture. I see one skinny old kitchen table, formica top thing, and try to position it so the built-in bench is best utilized. After trying different ways, I am satisfied and say, "See, now I can seat four at this dining arrangement!!" I laugh at my own silliness of calling such a simple thing a "dining arrangement." Then I see a bigger, better table in the next room and walk in and feel the places on the wall and say, "The refrigerator will go here, and the stove here and the sink here." Then I realize my husband is coming to the house. I've never met him before (sort of a mail order thing). I sit in an alcove at a big wooden table with other people. He comes in and I am disappointed. He's heavyset, older and stern-looking. He looks at us all and wonders which one is his wife. He chooses the young girl in a high chair and I laugh and say, "No, it's me."
