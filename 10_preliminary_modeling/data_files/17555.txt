I dreamt of the test I had this morning.  First I stopped to see my maternal Grandma Jane before an operation.  I didn't get to see her.  In helplessness, I made a phone call- to my good online friend Del.  He picked up and I asked if he wanted to come down to visit from his home state.  Sure, why not, he said, and was there surprisingly in 15 minutes.  I found out he was in the state looking for places to have laser eye surgery.  We still had to make the half hour highway drive.  When we got there the test was over.  I went to ask the teacher if I could take it, since there had been a family crisis.  The professor ignored me.  Immediately after, I was in my philosophy class, but in the same room.  They were going outside.
