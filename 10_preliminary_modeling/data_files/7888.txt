I was walking around outside. I was sitting on a stone ledge. Connie B and Susan J were there. I was talking to Connie B about the old house. She said there were so many people living in there with her right now. She was so frustrated. She said the families, and one maybe in particular, had a bunch of cats living with her in her room. One part of the dream I am with Paulette W, Joan Collins, and another woman. There is a man there too. Paulette W and this other woman and I are under the control of Joan Collins. I don't know why. We're so afraid of her that we will do whatever she tells us. She tells us that it's time to go have sex again. Something happens to interrupt us and the man and Joan Collins and the other woman walk away and I am talking to Paulette W. We're getting dressed and washing up and talking about how horrible this is and how much we don't want to do this. We decide to get dressed hurriedly and try to get out of there before she comes back so she can't find us. I'm not quite dressed and we here her coming. So I just grab my clothes and we take off running for the elevator. We realize that we don't have time to make it to the elevator so we run into a bathroom. We each go into a stall and close the door but we stand on the toilet so they can't see our feet. Someone, and I don't know if it is one of us or someone else, is actually going to the bathroom when they come in looking for us. They obviously don't see us because we are standing on the toilets and can't see our fit or anything. I am afraid that she may be able to see our heads above the top of the door so I am trying very hard to make sure she doesn't see any part of me.
