I was reading in Reporter an article by Shep Insel____ which began with a reference to "Mr. and Mrs. Jones" visiting them in California. There followed something about Shep having recommended some forty-one year old teacher friend as the dean of Nason College, a job for which I had recommended Shep. The rest of the article was about this man who was himself actualizing teacher, artist, philosopher type who had never been recognized openly until now. Then I saw this man sitting in his living room surrounded by 4 or 5 purple shell-like paintings or sculptures like Bermuda coral.
