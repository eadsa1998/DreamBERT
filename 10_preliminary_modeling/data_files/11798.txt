I was at Jungle Gym. The people wouldn't let us (Whitehall High School people) in but they recognized my name. Ropes came down from the ceiling. We had to get away from this crazy monkey lady. Then we were having free time. I was swinging from ropes into the foam and then crawled through a tube thing and Mariam was waiting and sitting with us.
