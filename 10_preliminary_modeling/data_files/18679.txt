Dora was back. But she was very fat. I knew she wouldn't stay that way. Her butt was huge. Then she was gone and I was going to see her. I was trying to look nice but the make up I put on came out in red racing stripes over my eyes. We were going to hear the best band in the world in Charleston. I asked at the door is it free and I could hear outside the door anyway. It was not free. I left. ??? leftover framework. I was working on the assembly line of a factory. One toy came through. There were no other toys. It was a toy (small machine gun sized squirt gun filled with Gatorade. The original Gatorade. Yellowish green. It was made of see-through milkfish plastic, white. You could see the Gatorade. It was the last one. I had to get it for Rudy. I knew he would like it.
