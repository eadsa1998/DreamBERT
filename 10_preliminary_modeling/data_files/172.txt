I'm walking in a mall and there's a store that sells silver and I think I'll duck in and look at silver flatware but at first I don't see any and it all seems to be big stuff so I go out and around again. The store is sort of self-contained and has 2 or 3 entrances, so I can go around it and look in the windows and all. I get to the other side and see the room with the flatware is over here. Besides, there's a man following me (or he sure looks like it) and I want to get someplace else, somewhere with people. I go in, see some stuff and see that this outer room is only samples and the main collection's in the next room - they probably have everything. It's a big room with lots and lots of styles and their prices are good.
