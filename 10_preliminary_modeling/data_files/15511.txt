It was night, around 9pm, and I decided to go to the movies. I drove to Centerville cinemas and it was different. I was checking the times, then Ezra was with me and we were going to see some 'bad' movie, but we decided to see this other one. Then I was with a guy and he was 3 or 4 years older than me, but really short. He looked younger than me. I liked him though and I was worried that people would think I was dodgy if we dated.
