Walking along near "Basin" (in Potomac Park) I see 2 (or possible 3 or 4) hunting dogs about some distance ahead. The are tan and white, short haired, and shaped like hounds. Weight, about 25 lbs, perhaps less (i.e., they are smallish). Their movements are quick, erratic, and jerky. Presently I notice a man putting them into kennels.
