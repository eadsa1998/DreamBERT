I was a spy in a house in which there seemed to be a party. I didn't know why I was spying. I sat on the edge of a chair in which a man was sitting and decided to pretend to be a woman. I flirted with him and then left for the bathroom. On the way through the kitchen I saw some coffee and yelled to the man to ask him if he wanted some coffee. The house was the one in which I lived as a child. I went to the bathroom and undress. A woman knocked at the door and asked for something. I handed it to her through the door (opened a crack). The man was about 26 and a stranger. I didn't see the bathroom door but I I felt that she was in her twenties and a stranger.
