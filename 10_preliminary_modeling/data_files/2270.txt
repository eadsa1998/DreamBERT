I'm on a rock cliff and there's a dark storm going on. An earthquake happens. Now I'm in the water and swim away from the cliff because of the falling rock. The water is dark, cold and has very high swells. As I get out deeper, I see a shark fin, and become afraid of deep sea monsters. I'm stuck now. There are monsters to the left of me, falling rocks to the right. I go back toward shallow waters. Then the quake stops and I get back on land. My mother calls over from the apartments across the rocky ridge. She wants to go on the beach and wants to know if it's safe. I look out and see the tide's out and people are playing on the sand. I prefer being on the dry sand; it seems safer than the rock or the water. So I say, "Let's go." We go out to find things. I find two ink pens. I notice the tide is coming back in and warn Ellie. I see three books in a hole in the sand. I try to pick them up but the tide comes in and I get knocked down and all wet. I say, "Oh, no. I got wet and cold for nothing!" I go toward shore. There are little cubicles that people live in. Their beds and things are all stacked up in there.
