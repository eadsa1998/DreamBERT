Mom and I were running away from that Jeepers Creepers dude. We were running through this corn/wheat field place. We ended up at this house and this guy who was a father/friend of the Creeper told him to stop and he said "I want to see them grow up, and then you can kill me" or something. Then it was 5 years later and the Creeper dude killed the guy, but before he did, the dude stabbed the Creeper, so that his blood, which was black and acid like would go all over the place. Then the Creeper was trying to kill us.
