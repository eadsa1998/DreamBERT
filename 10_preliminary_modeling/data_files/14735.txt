Some people from university and school and I were sitting on a bench which was connected to the wall of a building. I was next to Verity who left after a while. She came back with two huge bowls of kiwi fruit. Everyone took some and started eating it. I got my phone out to take a photo of the bowl. There was a clock on the wall above us which wasn't working. I asked this foreign guy to get this tray for me which had batteries. He did and said something about his friend. There was no battery holder in the clock and I asked Verity and she said she had broken it. I sat back down and Elijah sat down next to me. Verity was then collecting confessions. I got up but came back as Elijah was writing his confession. He gave it to Verity and she wrote something down and handed me a bit of paper which said "he really likes you". I was then watching Dawson's Creek. Dawson was on a movie set with Todd. He was only a props guy or something. He was angry with the movie because it was taking so long and all they were doing at the moment was building a house for it. He yelled at someone and said "fucking" and I thought that it was odd for Dawson's Creek to have swearing. He yelled at Todd with a play on words of the movie to say that it sucked. Then he went to yell at some lower level people. I was on Facebook which was different. I had messages from Elijah and different things. The ones from Elijah were now from Selena. One of them mentioned some show that Donald Faison was on and he had left it, but then came back and then it was worse.
