A game.  Teams with many colors.  Each had to collect six signatures and tiny pebbles from each color team.  Then they get a frog of that color.  The team to collect all the frogs first wins.  Pink, green, blue, red, orange, black.  I passed by the red team on their field, talking about how rough and difficult it was, but if they could master it, a great advantage on home games.  End of the day, I tallied up how we did.  Ready for a green frog, at least.  My dad was on the blue team.  It seemed no longer just team players.  I abandoned all that I'd figured out the night before and went to a man for a green.  He was a car salesman and had me sit in a low rider.  Pedals, but no steering wheel.  I was sitting on the passenger side.  I had to get in and out through the trunk.  Getting out was a problem.  I was wearing my short black clubbing dress and had to undo the straps before sliding out.
