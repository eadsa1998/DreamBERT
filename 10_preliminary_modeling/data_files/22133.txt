I was in a slum where there was much poverty and I started to help people so that they would have a better life. We built adobe houses which had a dining room and three bedrooms. It was functional. I cleaned the streets and I wished that people would concern themselves with cleanliness, that they would work and that all the children could go to school. I also wished they understood that birth control was very important for a family to be able to have some of life's comforts. I felt sad seeing the empty looks on old people's faces, as though they had some profound sorrow.
