I'm living in a place that used to be a store, and trying to rearrange the furniture. I don't have much, and the place is really bare, but the floor isn't flat - there are steps all the way across the room, starting about a third of the way across. The wall on that side is a plate glass window. So I can't put any furniture on that side of the room, and it's discouraging. At first I think there's only the one room, and I won't be able to get my bed in here, but then I think, well, there's the other room, maybe I can make that the bedroom and this can be the living room. I'll see about that. I'm in a little store right before Christmas, it's dark outside, after work, and the store is dim and nearly empty. There are a few other customers poking around, and we're also trying to solve a puzzle for a contest the store owner has every year - a little thing, you solve the puzzle, blow a little whistle to announce that you did it, and you get a little Christmas trinket. I solve it and go look for the whistle but it's not there. I call out to the owner, "Are we supposed to just tell you when we've solved the puzzle, or what?" - he says, yes, that's fine, I'll go get your prize. There's a couple in the store who are really pissed. They think I cheated, and they're grousing to themselves. The owner brings out a bag and empties it out on a counter. I can't tell what it is yet, but it looks very nice, like it came from Neiman's - I figure it's probably something else; but it turns out (the owner says) that it actually is the prize. Oh, boy. Sandie has come by with a friend, and given me a Christmas card she's made from old bits of antique cards. I think it's really nice. There's a part on the front that's incomplete - it used to be a puzzle where you'd take the pieces off and there was another picture underneath. I tell her that it's really swell, she could actually market this. Actually I'm not sure if this is my card from her, or she's just showing me what she'd made.
