 I'm on a street that I know to be Gerald Avenue in Woodland, though in waking it is in a different vicinity, southwest of Brimson. I skip down the sidewalk going north. I take long strides, going fast, and seeing how much of the road I can leap over while I skip. I leap, and soar over the entire street. I cross Old Avenue, and am on Fish Street, coming from Brimson. I leap into the air, jumping ten feet or more, floating lightly, spinning, and twisting before landing softly and leaping again. On the northeast corner of Old Avenue and Fish Street is an old brick house. While I leap I land on the lawn of this house, on a small but steep hill that is in the front yard. A young girl rides by on a bicycle. She says something to me indicating that she's mad that I jumped on her grass; she lives in the brick house. She rides her bicycle around the back of the house to tell someone what I'm doing. I feel somewhat guilty, but not really, and I keep on leaping and twisting lightly as I make my way northward down Fish Street. I hope the people aren't so picky as to reprimand me for leaping on their grass.
