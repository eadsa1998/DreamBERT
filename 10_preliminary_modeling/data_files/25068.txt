 I'm outside at the Uptown Mall. My sister Ramona is there. She is all bundled up in snow pants, a huge jacket, mittens, etc. They are all too big for her. She is wearing my Milton hat. I think to myself: "Didn't I give that to Nicole Peterson?" ( I actually did in real life.) My friend Marge Drummond is there and she comments on Ramona's big, warm clothes.
