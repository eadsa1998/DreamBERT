I am the wife of some guy that owns a big business; we live on the 5th floor of the building. I am sorting things. I'm supposed to pay bills and record receipts of expenses, but I'm behind and it's confusing. I say next time, "I'll have him take care of the home stuff and I'll do the business or vice versa. It's too much to do both by myself." Then I go to the elevator. I'm going to inspect the library. I'm told that Delia, the librarian, is pregnant. I sign. More work for me. The elevator door is curved and narrow and I barely get in. We go to the 4th floor and I get out. I enter a lounge area where employees can recreate. There are musical instruments and tapes and so on There is a guy there, kind of arrogant and pushy. We talk.
