My husband had died and this is sort of a strange thing. I can't remember a lot of the details clearly because he never was, I don't know how he died, and he never acted really very dead because he talked to me and we made plans and everything as to what I should do and what, you know, everything about money arrangements and so forth. So after we had been talking for a little while I wondered whether he really was dead, why he couldn't be alive again because naturally I wasn't very thrilled with the idea of not having him around any more. So I asked him. I couldn't really be convinced that he was really dead. I thought it would be nice if I could take his place somehow because he had a lot to do that he had never been able to do and lots of things were important that he could do. I didn't have anything particularly important, but he didn't think that was possible either. He had been in this state all day that he was dead, so I decided it was time I called my mother and told her so she could come up and comfort me. Although I thought it was going to be awfully funny if she comes up here and she sees him still walking around, she's not going to think he's dead. So I tried to call her, but nobody answered at our house and I was wondering about calling my husband's mother, but I never did. I think the dream ended with us sort of sitting around discussing it and I was getting more upset with the idea of his going to be gone and not be there anymore, and also less convinced that he was dead all the time because he didn't act very much like a dead person would.
