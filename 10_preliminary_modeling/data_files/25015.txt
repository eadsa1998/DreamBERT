 I'm in a stadium playing a 4 on 4 on 4 basketball game. Each team takes turns going up and down the court. One of the teams gets a technical found and gets disqualified right away. One of my team members is somehow out. So it is my friends Hank Anderson, Norman Noman, and I against the other 4 guys. We play hard. I dominate almost every aspect of the game: rebounding, shooting, passing, and dribbling. I am stronger than the others and use my strength and toughness to beat others. <br/
