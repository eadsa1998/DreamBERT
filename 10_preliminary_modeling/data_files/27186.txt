The setting of this dream took place at school in H--. I was talking with a former student of Mother who also was a former psychology student. I dreamed that she was taking Personality &amp; Adjustment &amp; had recorded one of her dreams. I was reading it. I don't remember what the contents were - or I didn't dream it - but I do remember the short concise sentences. This student is about my age but who graduated last June. She is just a casual acquaintance.
