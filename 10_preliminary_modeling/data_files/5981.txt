I am reading about a new type of professional soccer league in a color weekly news magazine. There is a description of the game and some of the new teams, including a team named the "Cosmos", which the magazine article says may follow in a "tradition of dynasty by previous teams of the same name in earlier leagues." I find myself at the opening game playing for the "Cosmos". The rules are a bit changed from regular soccer: a center square portion of the field is quite a bit raised in elevation over the rest (i.e., it is not a level playing field.) This center portion is landscaped with bushes and trees, and the rest of the field, which looks like a standard field, is reached by steep ramps. Play begins at the center of the square section. The ball makes its way towards the goal of the opponents of the "Cosmos". I am standing there, and when the ball is nearby I kick it to the goal. I watch almost as if in slow-motion as the opponents' goal-keeper misses. I have scored a goal and everyone in the crowd cheers! Play resumes. I see that several players use their hands in this version of soccer, but I am not sure when this is allowed, so I decide to play as if it were regular soccer. Again I am standing near the opposing goal as the ball comes. I break out of a pack of players to get to the ball and from the right wing position I kick it into the goal. The poor opposing goalkeeper looks overwhelmed as the score goes by him. In an apparently new rule, after the goal is scored the goalkeeper himself kicks out the ball into play (instead of starting at the center of the field.) The opposing team plays sloppily and I quickly get possession of the ball again. I boot it hard directly at the goal and score a third time. The crowd goes wild as I exclaim, "I LOVE this game!" I turn to my brother X., who is one of my "Cosmos" teammates, and confide to him, "Their goalie is not too good; they should get another one."
