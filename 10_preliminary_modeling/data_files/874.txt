I'm in an acting class. We have to chose a final scene. I chose a humorous monologue that has few words, most of it is gestures. I start to practice. There is a feeling of nervous performance energy. I get into my costume. I'm pacing and rehearsing. The owner of the tavern/acting instructor comes over to me. He has to leave for awhile. He asks me to take over temporarily. I am a little annoyed and surprised because I'm into my rehearsal. I agree. I go out to the table and sit down. The customers are watching the finals. A girl is up onstage doing her monologue. A drunk yells out, "Everybody be quiet, I want to watch her!" A man at the next table behind him yells, "The only one being noisy here is you!" The drunk gets up. He yells, "I knew some drunk would ruin it." He goes to the other man and pulls and twists his nose. A big fight starts. I think, "Oh no," and then I feel strong enough to handle it. I get up and firmly grasp one of the fighters by the shoulders and firmly tell him he has to leave. Even though the place is in an uproar, they hear me and start to calm down. I think it is ironic that I have to throw out the man who claimed he wanted it quiet and then started the fight. After he leaves, the boss comes back. He's asking me how it went and I'm telling him. While I'm talking, he sits in front of me and looks up at me with sexy desire in his eyes. I look very beautiful but my costume is satin cushions or pillows over the front of me. He is caressing those pillows tentatively like he'd like to remove them and touch me but isn't sure of himself in terms of how I would react. I am emotionally somewhat removed and just watching him.
