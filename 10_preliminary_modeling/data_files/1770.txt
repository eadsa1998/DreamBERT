I am married to some rich guy. We have a huge house, lots of rooms. All the rooms have lots of dirty dishes. I am gathering up the dishes and taking them to the kitchen, feeling overwhelmed with so much. I get a phone call. A woman asks me if I'll have typing work for her soon as she needs the money. She can work because Susan doesn't need her now. I think it is Judy and I say, "Sure, I'll have some work for you next week," but I'm really not sure if I will or what I'm doing with my work. I hang up and then I see Judy and realize I don't know the name of the person I was talking to. I remember then it was probably Dovre R. I then go up very broad carpeted stairs to see the second floor. It's a hotel. I see room after room. Women are in the rooms. One is named Emily. Some of the women are beautifully carved statues in rose or teak wood. They are lying or sitting in their beds. I go to the 3rd floor. There is a conference room. A blind woman sits talking to herself. I do not respond to her and move on. I see a door made of glass and wonder where it goes. I open it and test the floor. It opened into a small square closet-sized room. The floor is a trap door and opens to create a chute down to the auto bay where my husband works on his racing cars. I think, "I might have known." Another woman fell into the chute and lands in the auto bay, so we've been found out. I realize the chute is illegal, another bad thing my husband does. I hope he gets caught so we can sell the house, but a small cottage where there are fewer dishes to do and maybe I can write.
