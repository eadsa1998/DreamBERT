A car full of my friends &amp; I went to pick up a boy whom I don't know at his home. It was an immense home. The rooms were divided by large pillars &amp; we drove right into the house. It was quite a test of driving skill because the pillars were close on either side of the car. I talked to the boy's sister while the others went upstairs to get him. We heard the sound of footsteps outside &amp; looked for prowlers. The wind howled. The boy was just back from the U--- of I--- &amp; said he was D--- C---'s roommate. The sister had red hair &amp; turned out to be only 14 after I thought she was my age. I woke up, looking for &amp; expecting to find a prowler in my room. I went back to sleep &amp; found myself selecting saddle leather handbags. The clerk was a girl who used to work for my Dad &amp; whom I have seen several times recently. All the bags were soiled and marked down. The scene shifted to the dime store where I was selecting jade rings. They must have been made of candy, because I nonchalantly chewed one of them. One was the figure of a Mexican, another a turban-covered face. I was with an older woman I knew but cannot now identify. She was holding my watch for me. It was five o'clock &amp; we couldn't put our call through to Italy since it was three o'clock there, and also because of the telephone strike.
