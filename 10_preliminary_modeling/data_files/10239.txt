Frank and I are living in a house with many women, they live upstairs and we live downstairs; we all get along very well; then I hear that one of Wendy's old friends, Sue S., is coming to stay with us as she has a child who needs to go to the nursery school that is being held in our house; I write her a check for the tuition of $18.- but she is angry at me for doing that; "Don't you think I have my own money?" There is some confusion and Sue finds a room in another house nearby. -- shift: I see Pedro who reminds me that we are to have dinner at 5 PM that evening I am glad because I had almost forgotten the date. shift: I am walking in deep SNOW along a road with the headlights of a car behind me shining on the road I walk fast until I get tired, then the car pulls up and I climb in and we drive off... (with whom?)
