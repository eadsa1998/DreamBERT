 I'm at Lake Jefferson in Wilmerton playing pool with my brother Wally and others. The pool table is on the north/northeast side of the lake, about where the stream flows in. I see the Thomas family arrive in the distance: Bill, Tamara, Tina, Jessica, and a female I think is my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas, but then realize she is Tina's friend. Jessica walks up to the pool table. I don't say anything to her, putting on my "cool" persona. She talks to Wally mostly, and some to me. She says that Annie and Wally slept next to each other from the 23rd to the 29th. I know that Wally wouldn't double-cross me: he wouldn't do anything sexual with Annie, so I'm not worried about it.
