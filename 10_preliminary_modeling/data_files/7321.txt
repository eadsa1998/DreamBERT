There will be no congregational singing because there are no hymnbooks in the renovated church. I had been ill and couldn't remember my schedule and where my classes met. But chapel came first so I went there but there was only a priest praying alone. When I returned a woman asked me where she should go to have her son's classes arranged. I asked and learned he was in high school. I told her the secondary school was cross the street but there were grade school buildings also there so she had better ask the way. I wanted to point out the building but there was now a closed door in the way.
