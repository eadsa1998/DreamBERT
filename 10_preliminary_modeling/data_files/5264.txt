I dreamed that I had bought the brand new Synergy hockey stick, and I couldn't wait to use it. There was a pick up hockey game some winter night when we were getting snowed in. When I picked up, however, I realized that I had bought a righty instead of a lefty. I was so disappointed at myself for my foolish mistake. No matter how hard I tried, the stick stayed righty. All the other girls laughed at me. Then I started a new dream that was at my brother's 2nd grade parent-teacher conferences. I was really bored and kept falling asleep until the teacher used me as an example of the student who had perfectly gotten through elementary and middle school, and that I was doing excellent now as well. Then another woman engaged me in a conversation about Pirates of the Caribbean but I fell asleep (in my dream). Then I woke up in real life.
