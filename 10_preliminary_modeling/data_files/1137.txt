Aunt Naomi, my mother and I are sitting at a table. Aunt Naomi is talking about past lives. I see someone changing right before my eyes. They are half-animal, a monster. I scream. Then I want to see mine. I stand up and look in a mirror. At first, I see a green face. It is ugly. Then I see an animal face, all hairy and coarse. Then I see rapid changes, like a fast chronicle of lives passing. I was a beast, a prostitute, a courtesan, and a nun in WW II. That was my last life before this one. This life is a life of transition from body, sex and egocentricity to spirituality, spiritually oriented and religious.
