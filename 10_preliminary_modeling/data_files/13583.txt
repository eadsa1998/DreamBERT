I was in a building underground. The entrance had glass windows around it and had glass doors. Ezra was there too. I was trying to leave. There were two doors that would take us to the entrance. I went to one, but I saw this freaky lobster/scorpion thing so I left there. I thought I saw a crocodile. A couple and a young girl came in and the baby was near the crocodile, so I called out to the parents and a light turned on. It was just a cat. It looked evil and talked to me. I said that I wanted to get through and it was like "Ok, go ahead". I asked it about the lobster thing and it said it didn't know what it was, but "maybe it is lethal". Ezra and I went to these stairs to leave and a girl went through some doors and a lobster thing got through. The doors to get out wouldn't open. There were these rope things hanging from the ceiling and I grabbed one and swung away from the stairs. Jude Law (as Jerome Morrow in Gattaca) was there, his name was spelt wrong somewhere. He offered to get bitten by the lobster thing to see what happened. He could then walk, so everyone was like "Let's go", but I said that it might still be deadly. Lots of people ended up dying. Some army guys came. Some lady had a card that would allow two people to leave. Someone and I left. We went to this place and they had this machine where you could ask about any one and see who their "soul mate" was. When I put in 'Mom', it said Nana and Poppa and they realized that I'd 'stolen' the card. I ended up back underground. Eventually a lady came through the doors and we were allowed out. I hugged a car when we got outside. They blew up the place and it turned out it was our school. I said "We start school in a few days and now they blew up the school". Dad said "only the nice part". Behind the school there were some big white buildings and I saw Mr Willingham walking on there. Ezra asked who the math teacher was and I said "Mr Gutenberg".
