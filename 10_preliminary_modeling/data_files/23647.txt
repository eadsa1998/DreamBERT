Some new persons at the dream practicum are discussing the method and they are saying that it is just as interesting to see what makes things change. Hanako, my Tokyo dream group co-leader, laughs and says: "We go from the assumption that it is possible to feel what the other character is feeling. But that is just an assumption because maybe we cannot." I listen very carefully and say, "That is a good idea, to see what makes things change." Because I am dissatisfied that we always end up in this paradox. It is always the same and we agree to try and follow how things change. I say this is a good idea because the Jungian problem is that you always end up with the paradox. It becomes boring as well.
