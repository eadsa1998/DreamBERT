I'm at some kind of convention in medieval times. It seems like it might be taking place in a tent or on a boat, like a barge in a park like the Boston Common or in a large building. Anyway, I come into this building and there's this very colorfully dressed and very masculine type of woman giving a lecture on some kind of apparatus. I do know where this comes from. Put this in now. Miss Whitlock, the principal of my elementary school, Lincoln School, and a convention in Atlantic City. Back to the dream. This woman is dressed in as a knee, like knickers and very fancy clothes and is pointing out various things to this group. I'm off on the side and Audrey is there. It turns out that this is really my speech, but that she's giving it. It turns out that this is the custom in these times. Nobody gives their own speech. They always have some kind of a stand-in. It's like a pen name except with regard to lecturing. It turns out she's talking about my scoring system. Audrey is there with me, and I'm pointing out to her some of the nuances of this scoring system that the old battleaxe is talking about. Somebody else is there like maybe my father-in-law, Max. He's getting a big bang out of this and Audrey is pointing out an inconsistency. One of the categories doesn't seem to quite fit. Then I say it does and she says something like, "Well, what if you had a dream item like this, it wouldn't fit." I suddenly realized that she's right on that one, but then I have this woman pronounce a new principle, like we'll deal with that kind, something like we won't. It's the opposite of burning bridges after you cross them. You don't look for trouble until you find it or something like that. The scene switches in here and I'm in a bar and something about some women. That's all I get of that.
