I'm having tea and sandwiches in a cafe garden in Sri Lanka with Juan. It's my treat. This place feels more like my country than Sri Lanka in terms of the countryside. I ask for the bill. It comes to something ridiculous - far too expensive for Sri Lanka - about four times what it should be. I get very angry with the waiter and refuse to pay that much. He insists that is the price and ends up getting very upset, because he says his boss will take it out of his wages if we don't pay. So I give him all my money but I'm still slightly short, so I start scrabbling around on the ground under the table for dropped coins. I do find some, but one of them is fake - it's a very soft metal. So I finally leave owing the waiter the rest. I intend to return to pay him. Juan doesn't have anything to contribute.
