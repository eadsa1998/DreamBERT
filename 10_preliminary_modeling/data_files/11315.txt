The dream included two girls and a boy whom I know. One of the girls was quite a close friend of mine. However, about two weeks ago I had a misunderstanding with her and the situation remains somewhat tense. In the dream this girl seems to question me about trivial things that I can't recall. Then the other girls enters but says very little. The boy enters and he also remains quite untalkative. This girl and boy then sit down and listen to the first girl question me. Finally, I take the girl by the hand, but she still continues to quiz me.
