 I'm going to the career development center at Brimson to talk with someone about revising my resume. There are two women there, both are busy talking. I wait to speak with one of them. Then I ask them if I can see one of them. They tell me walk in hours are not today, but are Wednesday night, and Thursday and Friday.
