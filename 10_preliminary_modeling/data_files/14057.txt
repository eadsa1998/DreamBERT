I was outside a shop. Mom wanted me to read this book, but I'd already read it and she didn't believe me. I was then with a guy friend and we were crossing the road from Midvale shops. There was a school across the road which was an all boy's school and an all girl's school in one (although in the dream, this didn't seem odd). Anyone who didn't conform to the gender stereotype was shunned. I was wearing a jacket, so tucked my hair into it so no-one could tell that I was a girl.
