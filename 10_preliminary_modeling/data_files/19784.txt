I was carrying some cleaning equipment. Later I was confined in a hospital and was looking for an exit so I could elope. I came to a large room with a high ceiling. There was an exit there, but there were some distinguished looking men there who looked like judges, and I was afraid to leave. Later I was walking up a stairway feeling remorseful for having gotten into trouble and having been sent to the hospital because of it.
