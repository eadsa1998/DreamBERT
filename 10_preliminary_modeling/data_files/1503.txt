Some leader of a cult religion is after me. My boyfriend and I are trying to hide. We take the car into a parking garage and park it, hoping the leader's henchman, Chuck doesn't find us. We take an elevator that has a toilet and smells. Chuck sees us and follows. I have a cat. The leader grabs us and takes us to his car. We are going to go to his chapel. We escape and the cat gets away from me. Chuck goes after it and I patiently wait for him to bring it back to me. He does, but he won't give it to me! I am angry because I realize I'd been too stupid, trusting him. I have to follow him because I love my cat. My boyfriend has to come, because he loves me. We get inside and sit at the back, just to the right of the door. It's like bleachers. I see Dora and am looking for Lucy. My boyfriend goes down to the stage and does a satirical song making fun of the religion. The audience is shocked and then start to "wake up" to reality. Another man gets up and warbles a crazy song. I get my cat, who keeps trying to get away. My boyfriend sees Bishop Tutu and makes fun of him. They have lost their controlling powers. He comes to get me and we walk out, past the angry, but powerless leader.
