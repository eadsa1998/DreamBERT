I had another dream earlier about F again, he and I were in a room. I think, just standing and talking and all of a sudden he said, "Oh, I get it!" and he looked up and d here was this shelf with 2 hats on it, one was his and one was mine; a red baseball type cap with the Marine emblem on the front, like I bought at the PX of the [veterans hospital]. His was like a felt hat that men wear in the winter but it was made of straw and it was on top of my hat, and apparently this was a very sexual thing to him because he turned to look at me and he said "I know why you did that" and there was a sexual tension in the air and you (the researcher) walked into the room and looked at us and looked at the 2 hats and began to laugh.
