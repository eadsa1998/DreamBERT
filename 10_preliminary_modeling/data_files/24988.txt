 I'm playing a basketball game in which Amy Leopard is the referee. I get a fast break, one-on-zero. I dribble and run funny, because I want to dunk. I get close to the hoop and jump. The rim is already bent down. I jump and dunk it lightly. The other team complains that I was hanging on the rim. I disregard their complaints.
