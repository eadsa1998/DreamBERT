I am a patient in a hospital, just being admitted. I overhear some nurses saying that they are going to strike and they will hide out at the OCA. I know this is serious and I must tell the authorities, so that patients won't be left in a dangerous situation. I notice some of the nurses coming near where I am hidden, behind some partitions, and I scoot down and hope they don't find me. They do find me and I pretend I am unconscious. They read my name off the bracelet I wear, the admitting plastic bracelet. Now, I know that if I tell, they'll probably be able to trace the leak to me. They leave, and I decide to go find the police. I tell them, hoping I won't get in trouble.
