I am in a church in my old hometown. Something is being said about "you think the date and the dinner are the same. Go to this restaurant." My husband is acting negative. I am thinking about finding an apartment. It is Sunday afternoon and I can't find a newspaper to look for ads. It is winter and I decide to go for a sleigh ride outside for something to do because he is so negative. The trail for the sleigh ride is in my grandmother's field where there used to be an old cesspool when I was a kid. The trail goes over that cesspool.
