["Disability and creative writing."] I am at a meeting of disability rights people. I am seated in my wheelchair near the front. I notice a great many more people than usual are attending. A boy sits in my chair with me. I am startled but try and accommodate him. He sits on my left. The chair seems to look like a large leather upholstered chair in a library but on wheels. The crowd swirls around me and I politely move back a bit as it surges around me to get to the front. Lucy and her family walk past me moving out of the room. She says she'll be back soon, but there are things she needs to do for the family right now. I am a bit annoyed, but let it go. Now the crowd quiets down and I see I am at the back in the back row. I realize I usually would be up front, but it seems fine that I just be an observer right now. Now I am holding a long index card box with many cards in it. I am showing someone a fat group in the middle that represent my creative writings. It's a lot. I feel pleased with the amount. I pull out a large manila envelope and pull out a laminated cute colorful picture of a dinosaur. I chuckle at it. I then tell the person that this isn't actually my writings. Someone else did this. I find a couple more cards with projects that aren't mine. I feel a bit nervous that my large group of cards is getting smaller. I can't seem to find one of my own projects in this group.
