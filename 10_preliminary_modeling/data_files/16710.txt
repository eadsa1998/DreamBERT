My first memory was seeing this blonde girl that looked familiar. When I asked for her name, she said Michelle, and I playfully jumped on her. When she acted surprised, I said, "Oh, sorry, I thought you were another Michelle." She said her name was Michelle. (There is a senior at my school with the same last name, but I don't know anyone named Michelle.) Yet the name sounded very familiar, even to the point that I checked my old yearbook for someone with that name after I woke up (without success). In my dream, she was probably related to Alex in some way, and she was a shadow at Prep Academy. I wanted her to shadow me, but she went with someone else instead. I was supposed to be in class, but went into another room to look for Michelle. Instead I found some people, presumably teachers, since the one person I knew was Mr. Grant (Some of the others seemed to know me, and shook my hand, but I didn't recognize them).
