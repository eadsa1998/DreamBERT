My boyfriend Jeremy and I had traveled somewhere and stopped for some reason.  I wanted to hurry up and get going- we were going to stop by the Greek restaurant on the way home.  He was dawdling and told me to go ahead and go home with my mother.  He wanted to rest.  I got mad at his laziness and that I wouldn't be able to go to Zolco's (is what I called it).  I told him, "fine, I'll go by myself...but then I won't be able to use the coupon."  Finally we got in the truck, but skipped the restaurant.  He went past our turn as he wanted to go to the bank.  For some reason we went to the one in a distant tourist town.  It was crowded and there was a huge line weaving around and up stairs to the tower where the ATM was.  Finally we went home.  I don't know why, but I decided to go for a walk back toward the bank.  I started walking, and when I saw the stoplight in front of me, I realized I was in the street.  I moved to the left where there was a path on the meridian.  A man across the street was being harassed by a fairly large dog.  One moment it was brown, another it had black and white spots.  I knew the dog would only go after him if there was a reason- the guy had to have drugs or have robbed someone.  The dog was drawing attention to him, but not hurting him.  The man responded by mistreating the dog and dangling him by his rear legs.  I looked down toward my feet, and there was a small white bunny in the grass.  I looked back up and caught the glance of the man.  He had a thin face and a very short hairstyle.  He had a dull caramel-colored complexion; he appeared part Caucasian part African-American.  I woke up still feeling mad at Jeremy.
