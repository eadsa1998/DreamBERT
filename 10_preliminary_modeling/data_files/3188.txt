Howard and I are in a house. I walk to a back room I haven't been paying attention to. I see a window pane is broken and a large bush is growing in through the hole. I see that someone has tried to fix the window problem. Howard comes in and wants us to talk. I groan, laughing a bit at myself and my resistance to this connection. He is gentle and coaxes me to sit beside him. I point out the broken window and say I hadn't noticed it, but obviously someone did. I was glad they did. [BL]
