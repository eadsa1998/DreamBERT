["Fire breathing villain is me."] I the dream ego is watching as "I" am standing in front of a bleacher full of people. I see that "I" have flames in my mouth and lungs. I am amazed I can survive that. Some special protective stuff I probably used, or experience and spray these flames onto the people. They are killed. I then stand in the center of where the fire burned originally as the flames spread out killing others. I am safe in the black charred remains of the burnt area. Now the authorities are after me. Someone is nice and opens a curtain for me to slip through. I am now backstage. Blocked. I see a tall curtain and see a rip in the end seam. I crawl into the curtain rather than behind it. The authorities come and check that area. I can see their shapes through the curtain. I lean back when they feel the area I am in. They somehow miss me. They leave. Then I escape unharmed.
