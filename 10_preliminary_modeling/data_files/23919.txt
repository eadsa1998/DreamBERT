All I can remember is the end. I'm sure there was more. I was told (or maybe just decided) to drydock our canoe. So I went to this old fisherman's house/store/restaurant and asked if he could do it. "Sure", said he and his wife. They were a cute old couple. He made me carry the canoe by myself to the racks to be tied. It was surprisingly light. My mom and dad showed up with a new puppy. It's running all around with the fisherman's dog. I tell them what I'm doing with the canoe. "No. That's not what I wanted you to do. You were supposed to get it repaired", said my dad. We tried to talk to the old man but there was another customer. The old man ignored us because the other customer was going to be spending lots of money. We waited around and waited and waited. We decided to name the puppy Sylvie. One of the decks was also a frying surface for cooking. There were fish frying all over it. The puppies would walk on the frying surface because their water faucet was right in the middle.
