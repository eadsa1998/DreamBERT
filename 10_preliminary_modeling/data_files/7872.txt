I was pregnant and experiencing labor pain in my back. In waking life my back was aching from walking the mountains today. I don't remember who my husband was but he was there along with another man. I was also trying to get married before I had the baby. There was a problem with the dress and something else I think. The pain in my back was worsening so I knew birth was near.
