I was walking across campus and was approaching the corner of Mather gym when I noticed a crowd of girls and a few boys, all my own age, standing in front of the gym. I was dressed in a brown suit and light green hat, which I recognized. As I walked past the crowd, there was a lot of laughter and I took off my hat and looked at it to see if anything was wrong. I kept on walking through.
