I was flying above the road about 3 ft. Then I flew up as high as the trees and I flew leisurely. I looked at a home. The lights were on and I could see the occupants within. I had a brick or a block of wood in my hand. I was going to throw it at a window and break it, but my conscience told me not to, so I flew by. I came to a river. Then I awoke. I was putting gas into my car and when I took out the nozzle, the vapor from the gas as it oozed out was so thick, it made a steam like and I was a little excited because I was afraid it might ignite and blow up. I was by Hilts and the phone rang 3 rings, then stopped. I picked the receiver up and said, "Hello." I heard a voice and couldn't make out who it was or whom they wanted.
