I dreamt about an Ethics class in which the professor was discussing with all my classmates. The professor was wearing sports clothes and he was very confused by the disturbance in the class. All of us started to speak and at a given moment we started to run, chasing the professor, and we ran so much that he started to get smaller. And then we realized what had happened and we felt sorry, and then we didn't bother him and the professor started to grow and reached his normal height. The colors that stuck out among the girls' dresses were green, red, and brown. I know something about dreams in psychology, and one dreams about what has happened that day or the previous day. Well, that day the professor of Ethics asked for a critique on the negative side of his conduct of the course, and the criticisms were plentiful. And this interests me very much because I am the class representative and any criticisms about a course become a point of discussion with the head of the program.
