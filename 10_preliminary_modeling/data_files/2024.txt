I am in the back seat/trunk of Ginny's car. She's backing into a gas station to get a tire fixed. I say, "I've done this before." A good-looking Spanish/Mexican guy is driving. He and Ginny are trying to decide what night we should all go out and have fun. Wed. night is suggested and I say, "Sure. Sounds good to me." Then he turns and looks at me and says, "Are you already taken?" meaning do I have a relationship with Hector? I say no. He smiles. I get out of the car and find us all now in a tall thick tower. We are way at the top. He has a small baby in a pink sling strapped to his chest. He's going to take care of her for a while. I think that's neat. I look down and get scared. I say, "Ginny, how do we get down?" She says impatiently, "You climb down." "How?" I cry out. She points to a spiral tower with lots of coffee cup-like handles all around it. "Just step on them and go around and around until you're down." "I can't." I wait. She looks at me disapprovingly, like I'm acting like a baby. So I try. I grab a handle and put my foot on a toehold. The tower sways and goes around and I cling, going down one scary step at a time.
