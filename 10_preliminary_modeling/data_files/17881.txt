I was asked to take care of two black kids.  I was on my way back to sleep so I sent the older one off to play and kept the younger in front of me and curled up to sleep, but the kids wouldn't have it.  They wanted breakfast.  So I got up and we made something.  Later my father was there and asked about something I was letting the kids do.  I looked over.  The kids were different- one was my longtime classmate Mark Adler's brother Tyler.  I told him they were old enough- Tyler was out of high school, after all.  I shouldn't have to take care of them.
