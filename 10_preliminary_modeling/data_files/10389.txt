Frank, Zena, Reynaldo and I are packing up ready to leave the Retreat Center. I ask Reynaldo for some money and he gives me some Japanese coins. I ask if they are going to work in the washing machine, and he says: "Try it." When I find the suitcase among bags and boxes, I can only fit my shoes into the suitcase. I say: "I wish I had known where these shoes were all along, as I have been wearing these same shoes every single day." I see Reynaldo and friend playing chess, and not sure if they are coming along. I am getting nervous, as Frank is taking so long to get ready. In the end, I guess Reynaldo stays on and we leave....
