 I'm in Carter Church. My mom reads both the readings and the Gospel reading. I am going to give the sermon. I wait for my mom to finish. I am nervous. I fidget, sitting on the steps next to the pulpit. Before I go up to the pulpit I whisper to her. For the sermon I talk about loved ones. It seems almost funeral-like. I say I'd rather leave this living world than lose a loved one. It turns out to be a decent sermon. I relax and talk okay.
