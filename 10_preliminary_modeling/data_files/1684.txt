I return "home" to show something to Ellie and see Arvonne is out near the door. I am upset that I have to go past her and she will see me. I go past and show Ellie my long chain of linked key chains. She shows me hers of equal length. Arvonne shows hers. I am surprised she enters into the discussion. We all sit at a long table. Arvonne says, "It's a good thing we've taken the afternoon because it will take lots of time for her to share all about her new boyfriend." I think, "Humm. Another one so soon. She's fast." I take a sip of oxygen off a tube out of the wall because we are on another planet and we need oxygen. Merle comes and joins us. I notice he is thinner and better-looking. I ask him how he does something. He growls, "That's personal. I won't tell you." "Well," I say, "You sure are in a grumpy mood. What's so personal about that? I'd ask anyone that question." I am aware that Arvonne had been ready to share and we were using the time focused on someone else. I felt badly.
