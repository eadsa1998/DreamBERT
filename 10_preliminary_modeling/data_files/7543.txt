Mary and I are in bed. She is lying on her side and I am behind her. She has a splitting headache and I'm trying to comfort her. I can't see her face. We both are clothed. I think she is wearing a robe. I place a paper or sheet of paper on her cheek and am stroking her head/cheek/forehead through this sheet of paper. There appears to be some sort of design on this paper and I'm trying to trace some kind of pattern on this paper in the hope that if I touch the right spots on the paper, and in the right sequence, that Mary's pain will go away. I am repeating over and over again, "I wish I can do something to make you better (or to make the headache go away").
