I was working at the computer and creating three different things. I don't know if they were documents or spreadsheets. I don't know if I already had the information or if I was thinking of it and then deciding which spreadsheet or document it would go into or where it belonged. It may have just been three different sections of one project or one document or spreadsheet. Part of this information involved weblinks. Part of it was informational and partly questions. The whole point of the questions was to get them to come up with answers that would compel people to take a certain action. I actually think I started out with just two documents or sections and then I had an idea for a third that I thought would be very useful in helping us to get people to take whatever action it was. I don't even know if it was CAS work or something else.
