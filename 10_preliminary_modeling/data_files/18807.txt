The first part of this dream I can remember was about grade school children voting on some issue. They were using red ballots so that collection would be easier. It seems that the ballots were left by the doors of their houses. While this was going on, I was talking with a street sweeper. He was quite well informed and had run for several offices. The last one he ran for had something to do with assisting the town manager. He said he had really done a job at cleaning out the corruptions in the offices then. (This man was a gas station attendant and school bus driver in my home town.)
