I had a dream that my friends and I went to Florida for spring break and I forgot to pack my hairbrush and my razor. I remember I was really frantic because I needed those two items. My friends kept saying that I could buy new ones, but I did not listen to them. I was pretty mad at myself for forgetting. Then I woke up.
