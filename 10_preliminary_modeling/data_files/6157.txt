In the room, there are my parents and a grandmother who in real life is dead. And I am crying, I am crying very hard. Tears running like a river. I was holding my grandma and she was crying too. We didn't say a word; we were just crying. I remember, that it was in a country, because through the window I could see a beautiful garden on the hill, which was far away. My parents were sitting and their faces were very surprised. Then we went to the backyard and I saw people sitting on the ground, in a narrow space between two houses and eating something from it. Also around there were small pieces of bread. From the place where we were sitting to the place where we saw those people, the way was very narrow. We had to squeeze between two very high walls at some point. These walls were [illegible] from [illegible] and I could see the beautiful [illegible] through them.
