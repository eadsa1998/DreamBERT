I had been working for hours ruling off a card to use for roll call in a swimming class. I did it all in India ink and as soon as I had al l the members in the class listed on the card, I gave it to the instructor of the class, Dorothy Crandall. However, she already had a swim roll exact like the one I had made, and so I told her that I had made it for the fun of it and she didn't have to use it. But she said that she needed it and so she decided to keep it.
