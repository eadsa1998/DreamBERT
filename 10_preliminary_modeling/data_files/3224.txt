I work for a radio station and am very well endowed in the breasts. I wear a shapeless sweatshirt to cover me up so men won't stare. They are going to a company party thing at the ""farm." I go inside and then overhear a conversation the men are having about me. One says, "I don't know if she's with us or not." I can't tell if there is a commitment. She seems to not care one way or the other. I realize this is so, and go to a closet and choose a pretty jacket to wear to the party. Now I look very good and I go out there to join them but all the men stare at my breasts and it makes me very uncomfortable. I get on the piece of shingled roof we are going to fly on with the man, who is like the WKPR radio salesman, a sleaze ball. I tell Charla to sit nearer me and not so close to the edge. We start to fly. It is precarious and I nearly fall off several times. We arrive at the farm and I see the cows, one a scrawny tough old male. I say, "I hope I don't meet up with him." We go on to the house.
