Several times I thought I was trying to wake up and trying to get Matthew to help me wake up. I felt I was napping too long but I was in too deep asleep to wake myself up. I tried to call to Matthew, Help me. Help me. Help me wake up. But I couldn't get anything out. I tried to roll over and was paralyzed and this frightened me. I thought to myself, This shouldn't frighten you because you know what it is and you tell other people about it. Still, it was frightening. I wanted to roll over to my side. I finally was able to do so. Then I thought I had somehow made it to my bedroom door, though I was lying on the floor. I was still trying to call for Matthew to help me wake up. I was trying to hit the door and/or the doorframe to get his attention. I thought I was moving my arms but I don't know if I was actually hitting the door or not. Whatever was happening wasn't working. I was not getting Matthew's attention and he was not helping me. I thought I had been asleep way too long and wanted to wake up. I didn't want to waste so much of my day off and I had a lot I wanted to do today. Still, I was in a very deep sleep and couldn't seem to wake myself up. I'm not sure if I looked at the clock 2-3 times in my dream or actually woke up enough to look at the clock in waking life. I had the sense that I had been asleep for about four hours. When I lay down to take a nap I was only going to nap for about a half-hour.
