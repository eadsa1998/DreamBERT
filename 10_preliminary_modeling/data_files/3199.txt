I am working a script and Ernie is there. I think I'm at his house. Ricardo and Rigo are there too. Now I want to go out, perhaps to a rehearsal. I borrow Ernie's car. Ricardo has the keys. I run out to get them from him before he leaves. The key is shaped like a tiny miniature loaf of bread. I have trouble getting the key turned in the ignition. Then I am backing up and nearly hit a car behind me. The car doesn't stop very well and I must really press hard and long on the brakes, but still I slide and keep moving slowly. Ernie is outside looking around the rear bumper saying, "Be careful, you nearly hit that car." I am annoyed because I knew what I was doing and didn't hit it. I am also feeling some relief that I had managed to not hit the car, as it's almost out of my control. I drive forward, slipping and sliding, and look carefully to see if cars are coming. Ernie is concerned that I'll screw up.
