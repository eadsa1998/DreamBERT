I am laying in a bed in a living room. Jared is laying on the couch across the room. It's night and we're getting ready to sleep. He starts talking about his beliefs in aliens in space. Something interrupts him and he stops talking. I do not encourage him to start up again, and then I wonder if his feelings are hurt, so I start the conversation again, saying how interesting I find the subject. I noted in the dark room that a gumball machine had been put up on the wall under Tom's picture. I think, "Who had the nerve to decide where to put my gumball machine?" I am annoyed. Then I notice we have fleas. I think about Howard and wonder if, since we never make love anymore, if he has affairs on the side. I decide that it's OK if he does. A woman says, "Oh, I think he does. I once talked to a little girl who said he was going to be her daddy soon."
