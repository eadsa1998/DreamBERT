This dream took place in an apartment which was supposedly my home, and was located on Cedar, near the top of Cc--- Hill. The building resembled an apartment, but the bottom floor was a huge mansion in which I lived. I saw two girls I knew, both named Virginia, and was talking to them through the window. I suddenly realized that I had missed a girlfriend's wedding, in which I was supposed to be a bridesmaid. The wedding took place at 9:45. I ran downstairs, and suddenly our basement was composed of many long tunnels with wooden posts, cobwebs, and insects. It resembled a mine and had many rooms off of it. I was with my freshman year roommate at college, and we were being pursued by an invisible worn! My roommate said something which angered the worm, and the next thing I knew she was being cut by a razor blade! I recall seeing scratches on her face and blood coming from there.
