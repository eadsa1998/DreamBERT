I was out the front of Mom's. We were sitting in the car. Mom started crying. A lady came and gave us a long stone, which was bumpy and was to be used as a tombstone for Ivan. It had 'Knepper and Padalecki' on the top and I thought it had something to do with Robert Knepper playing Freddy Krueger and Jared Padalecki being in Friday the 13th. I said "Robert Knepper for the win!". Later, I was near the sea. It was very murky and green. I was with others and we were talking to this girl in the water. I asked her about some episodes of Lost to find out where she was up to. I asked "the one with the taxi driver?" and she wasn't sure and I asked "the one with Bill?". I was actually talking about the episode of 24 when Bill got killed. She went to say whether she had seen it or not, which was somewhat suspenseful and then suddenly she got taken under the water. We laughed and then ran up the path to get away. Some skinny, murky green tentacles were flailing about. Then it was Jack and Sawyer from Lost. They went opposite ways to save themselves. Sawyer was then sitting on a playground with Juliet and was upset that Jack had left him to die. Jack was lying in a slide (it was enclosed). It was full of leaves and insects and things and he was talking to these two green snakes, about how depressed he was about Sawyer. They had a red bit on each of them, one said "1st" and the other "2nd". It meant they were the 1st and 2nd most poisonous snakes. He then heard Sawyer talking and slowly crawled out of the slide wondering why he was in there with the snakes.
