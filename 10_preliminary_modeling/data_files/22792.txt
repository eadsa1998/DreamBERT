I am at a conference somewhere.  Suzanne Sterme is there.  Clayton Thome proposes to her, and they become engaged.  We do a lot of swimming where we have to go up and around some hills.  One hill is especially steep, almost vertical, and I am all tense, fearing that the car won't make it and will start rolling backward.  The motor sounds loud and strained.  Something exciting or dangerous happens, like hunting a dangerous criminal, but I can't remember the details.
