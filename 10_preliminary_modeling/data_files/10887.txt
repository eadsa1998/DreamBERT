I was crossing the street and saw an accident. On the curb reclined a woman surrounded by about five or six people (men and women). They seemed to be supporting her. As I looked at her I saw her legs ended at the knees. She was uttering horrible sighs and screams in a somewhat rhythmical way. I sensed the street as 105, but I noticed a double street car standing on the track.
