I dreamed I was preparing a meal for a large number of people. I recall seeing these people seated at a table in a large dining hall, yet I knew that they were in my home. I had the feeling that there were a great many people here, some of them strangers, yet I could only see a few familiar faces....most of them my family (mother, father, mother-in-law, sister-in-law). I then remember being in the kitchen getting ready to serve and some of the women had come in to help me. I remember dishing out noodles and soup into small bowls and serving them amidst a great deal of confusion. I then discovered to my dismay that I had not prepared enough food for everyone. I served the main course feeling very embarassed, but my sisters-in-law were assuring me that there was enough for everyone.
