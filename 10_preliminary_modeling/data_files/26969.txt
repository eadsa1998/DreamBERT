Joe Louis was at my house. It seemed as though he was playing an engagement here as a trumpet player. He sat in a familiar chair in my living room and played hot trumpet music. Our front door was open and there were a great many people on the front porch and in the front yard who had come to see and hear him. I sat opposite him and became more and more interested in him. I decided that, since there was some place I had to go after his performance, I'd promote things so that he'd take me. He kept looking my way and smiling and I felt greatly encouraged. All of a sudden a young colored girl hurried through the room and upstairs to remove her hat and coat, casting a coy glance at Joe as she passed. I wondered whether it was his wife or his girl. He turned to me and said, half to me, half as though he were talking to himself, "At last she came to see me! I didn't think she would, she hasn't come for so many of my shows, but now she's here!" I looked at hlm and saw that his eyes were brimming with tears. I was very surprised to see evidences of such deep emotion, and also considerably crestfallen because that ended my chances.
