I was out the front and Josephine was there. She had a bag from Bunnings and she said "oh I have a job there" and I said I might and she was like 'I don't care'. I said I needed money and she was like 'that's why you're doing it? My parents give me all the money I need'. I said 'so do mine, but I want my own'. She said that her family had a maid.
