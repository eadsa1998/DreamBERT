 I'm near the south entrance of Carter Church. I'm working with another man my age. We hang up or stack jackets of little kids. My mom says we have to wear onion-like sacks with the number nine on them, so that what we're doing is legal. We seem to have something to do with beer. There are many new parishioners coming into the church. There are people from Rival High School who arrive in their high school apparel. I'm dressed in my pale green outfit with Doc Martins on my feet. I'm performing a trick or feat for a group of kids. A woman from my psychology class is among the kids. There is an electric door to the living room, and a big light switch.
