 I'm with my friends Stephen Ramos and Emerald Reinhold. They are selling red t-shirts that say, "I scored a goal" on the back. I ask them if I can have a shirt. They say okay. I'm in an apartment. Three men are moving in: one now, and two later. It's a surprise. I'm cleaning out the cupboards, throwing away old and bad food. Matt and Troy, whom I know from working at Grocery Ghetto, are there. They are leaving. I find a couple full gallons of milk on the bottom shelf of the cupboard. I yell to Troy and tell him to buy milk in smaller containers so it won't spoil. There is some spoiled hair dye and some applesauce in plastic jars like the ones that Planters peanuts come in. The applesauce is still good.
