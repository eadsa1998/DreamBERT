I was walking down a path and on both sides of the path were sand dunes. I was walking with two people and it looked like we were trying to find a place to sit. I knew ahead of time that once we found a place to sit that I would leave the two people I was walking with. I was just dropping them off, I guess. As we walked down the path, I noticed a lot of people sunbathing on the sand dunes. I commented to the people I was walking with that as we went down the path, the bathing suits I saw the women wearing were getting weirder and weirder. I said, "People are just using them for show and not to swim in." During the walk I didn't recognize the people I was walking with, but when we reached our destination, I recognized the mom as TV star Roseanne Barr and I was also walking with a little girl. As soon as we found a pot to sit, I left.
