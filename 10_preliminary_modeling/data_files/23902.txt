I was in Muleshoe Canyon, the left fork.  As I walked in the canyon, to the east I saw a side fork slot canyon that I had not noticed before.  It was more like a tunnel or cave with a high ceiling, closed in at the top.  But it went back a long way, curving.  I went in a ways, a little hesitantly.  I had never noticed this side canyon before, which I wondered at and was amazed at.  Was it here all the time?  It was like those dreams where you find a room in your house that you never knew was there.  In the side canyon it was dark and hard to see, my eyes had to adjust.  It seemed like there were people living in there, pockets of groups of people and children, maybe even dogs too, who had made the side slot-tunnel their home and now lived in there.  They seemed poor or unfortunate, they were living on the dirt floor.  I came upon them in little groups, and didn't want to alarm or disturb them, it seemed they felt they had found a hiding-place from the world, and now I had opened it up - hikers! tourists!  I didn't want to bum them out.  Also in this dream a group and I had to go do something, we went alternately from Muleshoe Canyon area to some city, motel, or office/bank building.  I remember the ceiling in a motel or office building, a stifling claustrophobic feeling, and looking at the rectangular windows right under the ceiling.  There was waiting time with them while we scheduled our obligations.  Then back to the canyon.  So there was a contrast of living in a canyon and living in a city.
