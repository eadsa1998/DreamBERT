My wife Bonita and I were in a place like Shakey's Pizza Parlor-- with a lot of the agency people, I think, though the only one I can remember specifically was Bob McNamara.  We were sitting at two long benches at separate tables, with our backs to the tables, so that we were facing each other rather than the tables.  Someone (male) at the opposite end of my bench was naked, and I sort of put myself in his situation and remembered the times I had been (in dreams) naked in public.  Soon, though, almost everyone was naked (though I never saw them disrobe).  Everyone on the bench opposite me was naked; all were men, and they were leaning slightly to their right, bent slightly forward, and staring soberly at the floor, as if to affect a humorous pose, sort of like in a barbershop quartet.  Since the few remaining clothed people were taking off their clothes, I figured Bonita couldn't object if I took mine off too, so I did.  Our bench then also struck a pose similar to the others, but leaning in the opposite direction.  <p
