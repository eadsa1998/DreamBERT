I'm in a big white apartment that I've never been in before. I'm here to watch a movie with this girl I don't know, and Sally Z. When the movie is over Sally falls down next to me and looks at me, then starts kissing me, but soon has to stop. She says, "I'll be right back." I get up and sit on the couch and she comes back and puts on music and pulls me to a big beanbag and lays on top of me and now she smells like weed. "So that's what she went to do," I think. She kisses me for a second and then has to change the music again. She gets up and so do I. Then I notice that one girl I don't know is still watching TV. I just kinda wanna keep making out. Another girl comes in named Sophe, then Shane comes in and says, "Hey, Dude, so you're finally hanging out again." I say, "Yeah." Then it becomes clear that there is a ton of food on the table, big slices of sourdough bread and sliced turkey and pineapple wedges. More and more people continue to come into the apartment and I apparently know most of them. We're all friendly. All the sudden Nate, Sally, and a few others go into a separate room together. I think, "Oh no, Sally is Nate's ex-girlfriend and she'll tell him we kissed and Nate's my best friend." I go to the table and make a turkey sandwich and sit down at the counter to eat it, and think, "Naw, Sally won't tell and Nate won't care," and then I wake up.
