I dreamed that I was at the beach and was swimming against Rachel. I had to swim from one dock to another, so I dove in and touched the bottom. Immediately, I felt like I couldn't breathe. I struggled to the surface, feeling the pressure on my lungs. It was really scary and I kept pushing upward. Finally I reached the surface and gulped air in. I was breathing really hard in real life and woke myself up for a second. Then when I fell back asleep I was walking home from the beach in my comforter. I was so tired I could barely stand up. It started raining and this little boy appeared carrying an umbrella and he kept me dry. When I got to my house, I asked him his name. It was Colin. So I got home and Kylie called asking me to help her on her math placement exam. I really didn't want to, but she kept begging me, so I couldn't just hang up. So then Sue drove up and asked me if I wanted to go with her to the mall and then to the movies. I really wanted to go with her, but Kulie wouldn't stop bugging me, so Sue drove off. I was really mad. Then the power went out and I couldn't turn my computer on.
