["Multi layered Paulina."] I am in a series of rooms. I am looking through drawers and trying to organize all the things I find. I find an old shirt I wore many years ago and can't see any spots or messes or rips on it. I then see a few, because I am convinced there has to be some. Then as I am about to toss it in the goodwill pile, I see I'd hung many of my necklaces on the same hanger so I keep it all. I find many small cloth pouches that jewelry might have been kept in. I gather them all up in one place. My mother is around there somewhere. Children are around and make noise. It spooks the horses outside. I go to a back window and warn Dwight they might try and stampede. I see small groups of horses in small barbed wire squares and see they can't break out though they whinny and raise up on their hind legs. I am relieved. I continue with my organizing project. Now Jerry and I are in a room and I say you need to relate to me how you fixed two items of mine and I will write it down. He tries to remember. He finally says well, I sort of looked at them and jiggled them and then they worked. I try and write this down on a framed glass sheet. That is the shape of Dwight's stamp B'day gift. I say Oh, so you sort of didn't do anything and they worked just fine. We laughed. Now I am at a dinner table with lots of people. Paulina is there. She is standing in front of me showing off her new work uniform. I say I see what you mean about multi layers. I see 3 or 4 different colored shirts a gold one, a green one and a white one, an off the shoulder peasant blouse. I say they want you to be sexy but keep it hidden. She also has on a large billowy jeans dress that makes her look a hundred pounds larger than she is.
