I was on a trip with a bunch of people. Some of them were characters from the TV show Will and Grace - Will, Grace, Karen, and Leo. Will received a phone call that Jack had died. He collapsed to the floor when he got the news. Grace ran up to him to see what was wrong. We thought Karen would probably take it very hard as well. we were in a building with no heat and it was the middle of winter. There was a lot of snow outside. It was almost as though we were in a cabin in the mountains somewhere. A number of people were either ill or becoming ill. Leo went outside and was hiking up this mountain to get this special box that would allow him to heal everyone. Someone else went out also and found it before Leo and brought it inside without telling him. Leo came back and saw what had happened and was very angry with this other guy, telling him that it would be useless to anyone but himself. I was trying to divide up the blankets fairly so everyone would have about the same amount to keep them warm. I gave Karen a sheet and a lighter blanket to make up for others having a heavier blanket.
