We are at a resort with our whole family. I am shown to my own bathroom, very beautifully outfitted with wall paper on the walls. The landlady shows me a bee-hive nearby. As we leave she says: "Go inside and close the doors and windows, or they can sense your smell and follow you. I look out the window and see Joshua (son-in-law) fighting violently with Mark (son-in-law). I can only see, but not hear, because the window is closed. Awakened.
