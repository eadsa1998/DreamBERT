I was at school/university. I finished math and went outside, in the rain, to walk to the bus stop. I then remembered I had Communications after lunch. I called Mom to get me so we could straighten my hair again. Dad picked me up. Darren was somewhere. I was going to have a shower, and then straighten but then realized it would take up too much time. Also, I heard a song on the radio that was by The Angels. It was really catchy and had 'January' in the title.
