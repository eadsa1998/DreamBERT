The first part I can remember the best is that Mom was going to have lunch with Lenny, and I was in Best Buy looking at some stuff, and I had my long book bag and it was dragging it around. And it had all kinds of stuff in it; it was real heavy. And sometimes I wonder if I look suspicious in stores before I have to look so closely and touch so many things. But in this dream a security guard from Best Buy started giving me a hard time and I said, "Here, do you want to search through this bag? Go ahead." And he said, "Yes, I would like to search through this bag." And he started pulling out all my books, my umbrella, my sweater, and I told him, "There are some blank CD RW's in the bag, but they've been opened. They don't belong to the store. And there's also a MiniDisc recorder that has my ID on it." And he's looking and looking through the bag, and then he packs everything back in just like I had it. He seemed satisfied. That was crazy, man. And then, the next little scene was that Mom and Dad were at this circus place with me, and there were these animals that would supposedly harm somebody, but they were so friendly and so gentle, this tiger -- actually there were two tigers and a bear. The next thing I knew, they were in our bed and we were just loving to have them. And Analisa, the little Jehovah's Witness girl, showed up in my dream and she said, she was sitting at the foot of our bed talking with us. And she said how having those animals in that bed was sort of like infidelity. And we were explaining to her that we just needed to give them a home and stuff. That is when I woke up.
