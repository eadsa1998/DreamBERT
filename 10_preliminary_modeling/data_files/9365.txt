I'm at a football game or music festival with Emma and my mother and father. It is in a Greek-type amphitheater so the top seats are ground level. There I'm to meet our friends Nancy and Joe. We are early. I wonder if we are in the right place and they know where to come. Then I see them standing above us. I go up alone. Nancy has on a see-thru blue blouse (light and airy) and a Navy-blue skirt. She has dark brown hair--between chestnut and brunette. It is sort of upswept, a little like Gibson Girl. Joe is thin and sharp-nosed, a little like William Powell in Thin Man series--no hairline, mustache--both look about 35 to 40. He speaks first, "I'm hungry." And I said, "Go to an Eastern Airline cafeteria. If line is too long, break in at front, if no line, start a new one." Nancy looks at me and says, "So this is what professors are wearing these days." I have on a brown suit and tie. Mother and Dad have extra seats. I slow down as we enter so Joe sits next to Emma, Nancy next to Joe, and I on the outside next to Nancy. I have to find out where they are staying, how long, when they can meet for dinner. Nancy is cool and correct, not revealing plans.
