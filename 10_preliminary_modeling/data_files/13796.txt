Dad worked at this little 'ticket' place (like a booth thing) and he had been working there for a while, but I didn't know. Ezra had known though. Dad liked this girl that worked there. We went there and these bad guys came. They wanted to steal the shampoo. We got in the car and the girl did something that allowed us to get out. I was then at home and there was a class next door and Ms Madsen asked me if I was "logical" and then a while later asked what I thought of some story "with the purple stuff". I said it was stupid. The next morning, I think, I woke up and felt dizzy and sick. I was walking down the hallway and fell over. Dad said he wanted to look at my phone. I slid it over. I told him I was too sick to go to school and he was annoyed.
