I was at a CLE (Continuing Legal Education).  Maybe in California.  I was looking for a seat, did not want to sit right up front, but didn't want to sit by myself either.  I found a seat I liked, or thought someone I knew was saving a seat for me beside them.  But when I approached it, someone else took it or it had been saved for someone else.  I was a little put off by this, I told that person I thought it was saved for me, but they could have it.  I looked for another seat.  The only seat left was one of those school desks, with the desk attached.  It was way over on the side, by itself, near the front.  I sat there although I did not want to, and resented it.  Steve B (an attorney I clerked for briefly) was there.
