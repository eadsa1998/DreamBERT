Huge feast at my house: see Lucinda and her mother; Mrs. FDR; Hillary, Pat, John B. etc. Pat is a great help; we have steak and potato salad 2 kinds of dessert; all done while I am asleep. Fight with Frank: about leaving, but he returns; everyone is happy, except Hillary, who is to fly back to her mother the following Sunday; she says But I can't go to two picnics."
