I took out $4000 our of $5000 that belonged to someone else. I stole it from him. I was at the track with Frank Hardwood. I had a bunch of tickets for the main event. I counted the tickets. I had about 24 of them. I counted them about 3 times, then I said, "I will have 12 and you two can split the other two." They didn't like that, so I said, "You have 15 of them and I the rest." Still they didn't seem to be satisfied, so I said, "Ok, we split them 3 ways," and that was satisfactory to them. I said, "Now we split the money down the cent." I left the track and I looked into a small box. There they had the horses or images of them. I looked at them and was not satisfied with it. I walked across the street into a drug store and there I sat down and was going to look at the program. The clerk came by and said, "Whose boots are those on the floor?" A lady clerk came by and picked them up and put them aside. Judy walked into a side street. I went after her and here she was in line with the school kids. I looked at her. She had mud around her mouth. She was eating mud again. I slapped her face a couple times and carried her down the street with Ann. I was down by the beach by Gordon Park. There was a girl with a rifle. She picked out a girl from the crowd and shot her. She was shooting at different objects on the beach. Then she pointed her gun at a woman with her husband, but it seemed she moved and she couldn't shoot at her. I asked her why she wanted to shoot her and she said she would be better off if she was dead. I said, "You may be wrong," and she agreed, "You may be right." Then she turned into Tommy Lasko. He gave me the rifle because I said, "Let me see how far this carries straight." The gun had a scope. I pointed at an object and fired and I missed it. I went into a store and there were about 4 show windows with baked bread and it was baked so nice and brown. We were sliding down the steps. I helped someone's car to slow down or let down the steps slowly.
