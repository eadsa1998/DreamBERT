I play the violin. I have two of them. One of my violins was the old one that I used when I was in the 4th grade. It used to be my mother's. The other violin is a serviceable one that I use. I play fairly well. I hope my fingers can manage the notes so I won't embarrass myself. Jock is around. He has unpacked a huge bass fiddle. I wonder how we'll fit it in the car. I put the violins on the back seat, without their cases. I hope they don't slide around and get broken. A man comes up to me. He is interested in me. He is married and has children and doesn't seem to want to divorce them, and at the same time he wants to have an affair with me. He is a bit plump and bearded. He reminds me of Pat Brown. He hugs me and kisses me. I let him without really feeling reciprocal feelings. I tell him that I don't want to have a sexual affair with him as he is married. I am also not that interested in him.
