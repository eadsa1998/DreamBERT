I stepped out of a parked car and walked from the east end of the block where the car was parked to the extreme west end and entered a drugstore. There the girl who waited on me was seated in a chair behind the counter which was situated in a partially hidden corner of the room. We became quite friendly and at once I felt guilty about this because I remembered I had just left a girl seated in the car. The girl waitress resembled a great deal the girlfriend of the girl I had left in the car. I was torn between staying with this waitress or returning to the girl in the car. I remember returning to the car, driving past the drugstore, and not telling the girl about the waitress incident that just had taken place.
