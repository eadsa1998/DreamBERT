I was in the stone courtyard of a medieval castle. I was with a boy. I don't know who he was, but I felt strongly connected to him in some way. I crossed the courtyard, going Southwest, and entered a heavy brown wooden door under an overhang. I entered the room. There was another room behind the wall, hidden, but the whole wall pushed back and there were two rooms. In the second room was a door, and I entered from it into a barn, sort of where they kept pigs, but there weren't any there now. There were about five people in that room, talking. I turned right, and I saw a personÑmale or female, I couldn't tellÑbut they said they knew my mother, who had died, and they took a dress down from the rafters that belonged to her. It was magic. I took the dress, and suddenly I was in the Northeast part of the walled-in stone courtyard, and the boy was next to me. Everyone was making fun of me for wanting to fly, but I didn't care. I called on the dragon. After a few minutes of calling it, it came, and now everyone was scared except for me and the boy, because we knew we were going to ride the dragon and it would take us to a better place. It flew over us and landed. We approached it. I woke up.
