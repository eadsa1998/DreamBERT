Am in the water at the beach. The sea is rough and white with foam. See the heads of several swimming children. I get out and start up a steep path thru a garden. I pick up a bunch of yellow discarded daisies and orange marigolds as I enter the house and offer them to mother. She thanks me and suggests I help her make the beds. I say that I had been going swimming again in _ an hour. Go on upstairs where she told me she had put the bathing caps. Find mine but must go to toilet even if hard to manage in a bathing suit.
