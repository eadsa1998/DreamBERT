We were friends with Tommy Wiseau. I was at home, but it was different. I went to my room and my computer and bed had been taken; only my desk ad cupboard remained. I had only been out for 5 minutes. I knocked on Ezra's door to ask him, but he hadn't noticed anything. We found Wiseau and he had gone crazy? He chased us and we ran into my room and locked the door. The door knob was round and had a lock on top of it. I could see his shoes through the bottom of the door. He was going to release some "prune juice" into the air -- which made it smell and hard to breathe. I put my head at the window (against the fly wire). Ezra wanted to leave so I said to get weapons first -- I grabbed scissors. He also had tongs which had been heated up. We opened the door and Wiseau had foil on his hands. The scissors were blunt and I couldn't cut him. I grabbed another pair and dooped him a bit in the stomach. Then we were at an airport and he got caught. There was a small rotating thing with socks on it. We drove past school and I yelled out "rapist, animal killer!" and the people there had a cat. Mom was driving.
