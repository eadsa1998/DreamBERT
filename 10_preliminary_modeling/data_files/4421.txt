["Holey shorts."] I am in a house. My mother is there. So is Charla and Lydia. My mother is lying on the floor, her head in a corner of the room, her body diagonally out from the corner. She is exercising. Charla is going to exercise too. I walk into another room and see a guest room. A single bed, a headboard and an empty bookcase all scrunched together in one corner of the room. I walk out again. I am seated on a mattress. I am trying to put on a pair of shorts Lydia gave me. I see holes in them and take them off again. These aren't any good. I need to change my clothes.
