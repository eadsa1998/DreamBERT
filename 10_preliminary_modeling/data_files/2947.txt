I am hiding in a rectangular basement room, thick cement, white walls and little else. There is a bed and some food stored there. I peek in little holes in the wall to see what the enemy army is up to and see a general talking his plans and see a map on the wall. Now I must try to escape and get the information out and I open the door and skulk up the stairs. I see soldiers and I hold my rifle ready to shoot and nearly shoot one, but I notice that if I just keep walking and don't draw attention to myself, they seem to not notice me. I had nearly blown it by making them pay attention to me. So I get across the lawn and see lots of parked cars, interesting designs. I decide on one and get in. I discover it's a sort of hang glider. I peddle like mad and notice I'm on a dirt road going slightly uphill and hope I can get momentum going before they get me. Then the road starts a gentle down slope and I start to go faster. Then I get a bit of wind and rise up in the air and then I see a cliff and off it I go, gliding and looking down the steep mountain slope. I save lots of time as the road is windy and I can take a shortcut this way. I see off in the distance far below a city and head for it, hoping I don't run out of wind or whatever it takes to keep me up there before I arrive where I need to go.
