There was a woman (called Essie?) with a Goa'uld (we were calling them that, though they functioned differently). We were keeping her under lockdown in this room and she couldn't pass the barrier, although she did once and you just had to say a word and it was like in vampire movies and she'd get 'dragged' back in. If people went into the room she could transfer over. We had to keep the door open for some reason and there was a kind of party/celebration happening. A dog ran into the room and I chased it out, but as I was trying to get it, a young girl (like 2) wandered in and went into a bed. As I went to get someone, the kid walked out. We concluded quickly that the dog was not infected but then I mentioned the kid had gone in. The kid looked shocked and was holding this bottle and had really small hands and I thought it looked weird. She was also very ugly. The girl said she wasn't infected, but was talking in 'homie' speak and her sister was like 'that's not her'. She looked defeated and went back to the room with us and transferred out. Not sure if same dream or the same 'storyline', but I had some group of people after me (though I wasn't 'me'). I ended up having to jump out of a window into water at night and then hid under this bridge - the building was surrounded by water for some reason, about waist-high, since while I was hiding under the bridge, people were walking around in it looking for me, though while I was swimming around in it, it was deep. Anyway, I kept going under the water to look at their feet and which way they were facing. But I was stuck under there all night. In the morning the 'head' of the group - a lady - said she'd found a body. Then at some point there was a baby/young kid and it was 'bad' for whatever reason, so I strangled it fairly violently, whilst also crying.
