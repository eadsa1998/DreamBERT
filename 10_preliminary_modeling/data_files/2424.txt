I am crying, sobbing. I feel enormous sadness. I'm leaving the man I love. His name is Jack Kennedy. He's very upset. I run from him and slam the door shut, struggling with the lock to get it locked before he pushes open the door. The lock is like an old one at M City House. He's hurt and begging me to open the door. I start packing my things. I pick up bouquets of flowers and toss them across the room in my sadness/anger. I pick up roses in green florist paper and realize I've got thorns in my left thumb and finger. It hurts and I cry as I try to pull out the thorns. Howard forces open the door and gently pulls out the thorns.
