A woman in a theater near where I sat started talking with me. A Puerto-Rican man sat behind mer, and he appeared jealous because I was talking to the woman. Later I was in the aisle, and I undressed. Then I went back to my seat and I asked myself aloud why I had undressed. An officer was nearby. I dressed and went outside. A real estate man was driving a car that had a camera-like gadget in it and the car resembled a police car. I was sure it was a police car at first, and I wondered why the salesman was driving it. Later the officer I had seen inside came up to me and said I should pray. I walked toward a bus stop to catch a bus. When I had gone a ways, I noticed that I had passed my usual corner. I missed the bus. I caught another bus and asked if it was going to Long Island. A woman answered no, but she said she would phone and find out how I could get there. She told another woman to phone. She was a giddy young blonde lady. As she phoned, she giggled in a silly way.
