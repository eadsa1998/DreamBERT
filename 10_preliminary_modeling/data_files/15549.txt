I lived in a dorm at a school. I think it may have been in the UK, but not sure. Someone said something bout Benjamin. There was a voicemail from Benjamin saying he was going to get laid. Arnie said something like 'oh, you're finally meeting up with Izzy?' and it had 5 likes. I was annoyed at the voicemail. I left the dorm at one point and it was difficult to get back. There were stairs at the other end and bridges. There was a guy trying to find money from his kid and asked me where I kept my money. Someone suggested my bedside table and I said "no, that's my underwear". They pulled out the drawer and it back. He asked again and I said "in my wallet!". I talked to Benjamin on MSN and he was seeing some Irish singer guy at a concert and said he liked Irish music.
