[1997-05-07] I dreamed that I was thinking about how I am different at work because of my blindness and how I'll never be like other people. The next thing I know, I was standing at the kitchen sink eating out of the sink with a fork and I knew exactly what I was eating, I could taste it even. We have some noodles with vegetables, like a pasta salad, that you just put in a microwave and mix with water and heat up. I was eating that out of the sink and I was thinking to myself I shouldn't be eating out of the sink, that's not very sanitary, I should be using a plate, but then I thought, well, I'm blind and that's why I'm eating out of the sink.
