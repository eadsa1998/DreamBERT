I dreamt that my younger sister, who is 10, had left the house at 8 a.m. and hadn't come back at 8 pm. I said to my uncle (who is dead) who was visiting us, eating, "Uncle, my sister is not home since she left early and it's already 8 p.m." He told me, "Go look for her with your mother." Suddenly there was knock on the door, and it was a neighbor who had a baby in her arms (it was no longer my sister but my godchild who is 2). And I noticed she was sad and asked her, "What's the matter with the baby?" She told me, "Don't get scared, she has cancer in her behind." And I held the baby against my breast and started to cry desperately and I awoke sobbing.
