I was at work. It was hectic. It was the beginning of the new term.I was trying to work on a report. People running in and out. Malcolm asked me to lunch. I said, "Yes," and then remembered I already had promised another person. I told her I couldn't make it, just as another woman came in my office to talk. Then the phone rang. A male voice said, "What's for dessert?" I laughed and started searching for my appointment book. I said, "This time I'm going to find the time." Then Malcolm, girl and I went to lunch. I was cutting a journalism class. I felt guilty. I then decided it was OK. A guy with long hair and a big sombrero sat next to us. Malcolm made some snide comment. The lady "sombrero" we were with gave an indirect apology and explanation.
