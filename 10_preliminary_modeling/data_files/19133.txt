The last thing that I remember, just before being awakened, was driving in a car with Doris and Brett. The area we were in was rather unfamiliar and there was some question as to where I should turn off this street. Brett was sitting beside me in the car and Doris was in the back seat. As we were driving along, at one point Doris tried to climb over into the front seat, but bumped into me and I was complaining that this was not a very safe thing to do while I was still driving. I believe she remained in the back seat and I turned off on one street, and they both said this was the wrong turn. After driving a short ways, I turned in order to be back on the original street we were driving on, and pointed out a building which was supposed to be a landmark and indicating that I did know where we were. Then it seemed as if the car were parked and Brett and I were walking toward this building just mentioned, and the building seemed to become more clear as a church now. As we walked toward it, we passed a group of 4 or 5 people containing both men and women who were strangers. At first it seemed as if we were rolling rocks toward this church, and then later it seemed as if we were picking rocks up and placing them around the grounds in such a way as to make it more beautiful. At one point as we were near the church, I remember Brett placing a cardboard box upside down and then we placed some rocks on top of this so that the arrangement would have the right height for the surrounding decorations. We walked along the sidewalk toward the church then and the grounds seemed rather unkempt and untidy. Just then church was letting out and large crowds of people were beginning to come through the door, so he and I ran to get ahead of them on the steps so that we could get down to the street.
