I am preparing to give a speech. I've got lots of notes and I'm putting them in order. I see maybe 20 or 30 file folders full of paper. Some get out of order. I go into the lecture hall. The exhibit is all set up. I start the speech with a bit on vocabulary and what words mean. The next section is a small aside about my father's interesting research. It's not really related to the main part of my speech. My father is standing to my right. He is impressed with all my work. I tell the audience to be ready to concentrate for 2 hours. Then everyone gets noisy. I can't be heard over the roaring background noise. I ask, "Who is interested in hearing the speech?" A few people raise their hands. I am annoyed.
