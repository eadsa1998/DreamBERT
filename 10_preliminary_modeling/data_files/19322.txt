I had a dream that two cars full with gangsters (guys) were chasing me. I ran and called 911 but the phone didn't work. I was going to jump out of the window of my back  house but then two gangsters were out there. A couple of minutes later someone told me (in the dream) that they really like me and they were chasing me because they really only wanted to see me. Then they drove away.
