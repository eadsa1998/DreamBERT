Mom, Ezra and I were in the car. Mom went to this house and this girl came out. She gave her smokes and the girl called out to her brother to pay for them. Her brother was Eugene. He saw me, but said his name was Bill. I was asking Mom why she was giving kids smokes. We went to this shop. Clayton and a made-up sister of his were there. I wanted a Yogo. We left and this guy on the road was using a trolley thing as transport. It went backwards and he was almost hit.
