I was getting a suit fitted. Then I noticed that five of my shirts were missing. Later I saw that they had been made into a tablecloth. I recognized the patterns. One was the shirt with barbershop signs printed on it. I was discharged from the hospital then, but I was upset about the shirts. I passed the patient named Reynolds and I told him I'd been discharged. I was on a narrow ledge, and a stout woman was coming the other way. She was annoyed when she had difficulty passing me. I almost fell off the ledge.
