Mom and I were out the back. She kept complaining about this ant [she was trying to kill ants yesterday]. Later, we went around the side of the house and he and this female ant turned into people. They were making out in the wood shed. He was kind of ugly. He was also Scottish and came inside. He kept saying how big everything was. He ended up taking a bus somewhere and we had to find him. He went to this big sandy place. Then I think he was an ant again, sometimes. He kept getting under the sand and I was following the hills he made. He killed this guy in a pool and later he killed another guy. I found him and he was small again (but now he was sand). I wet him and he turned into this creature that was mud coloured but was like a see-through cushion. I wet him again and he went darker and went back to being sand. He went to these stars (like in Super Mario Galaxy) and he said it was a portal to a place with awesome technology and stuff. The people he killed came back to life.
