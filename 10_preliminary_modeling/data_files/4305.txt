["How fat AM I?"] I decide to weight myself. Ellie and Charla are there. I want them to bring me the scales. I try to stand on one to discover that three different scales are stacked on top of each other and they are piled on clothes. It is high. I am standing holding on to the top bunk bed. I get frustrated and call to them to fix this. They aren't very helpful. I see the number 193 and am unhappy. I know that's not correct. We continue to try and weigh me with the same kinds of problems constantly keeping me from seeing how much I weigh.
