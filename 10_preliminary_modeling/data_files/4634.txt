["Hypnogogic images."] Lush growing plants like in my front window. As I was aware I was in the hypnogogic state I examined them and saw they were slightly different kinds of leaves. The background is a plate glass window. This image is in the top left corner of a dark purple background. I enjoyed looking at them and thought about how this is a good image that represents growth and health and healing. Another image comes. White with textured swirls. I become aware it's a ceiling. I wonder if my eyes are open and then I know I am seeing a mental image. It goes away. I think how interesting that was a ceiling. Then it pops back up as I thought about it. Another image. A lacy crocheted white rose. Very pretty.
