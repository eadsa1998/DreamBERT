I was at dads. I think Granny was over, or we were there earlier and she gave us microwaved chips for food. Ezra ate some, but it was gross and I didn't want to eat it. I called Mom and she told me to text her because she couldn't talk. She said she was looking after Amelia. I wanted to go back to her place to watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Later, Ezra and I were crossing the street and Ben (Lost) walked past behind us and I was like 'Ben is awesome!' and Ezra was like 'meh'.
