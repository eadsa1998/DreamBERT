 I'm at SuperAmerica and I buy a lottery ticket. The Powerball jackpot is $58 million. The person asks me which numbers I want. I say, seven, 31, and two. Other numbers I have are nine and 39. I also buy a scratch off ticket. The total bill is $4.51. I pay with a $5 bill. It's 2:00am. I may be with, or something may happen with a second ___ (I forget) wife (my second wife??). The real wife may be mad or jealous.
