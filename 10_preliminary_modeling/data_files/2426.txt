I am in a play or movie. I'm playing a sexy slut, with a platinum blonde wig, a furry white bra, halter top, big boobs. I come on stage wearing a sexy dress over the sexy outfit. I'm waiting for my boyfriend. Another man, the "bad guy," sits near me and on the arm of the chair I'm seated in, curled up in a sexy way. He moves his hand to cause my dress to fall more revealingly to show more leg. Then he sits next to me, his arm now around me. He asks me to dance. I agree. He pulls me close. I see he has a large butcher knife. I have one too. We fight like swords fighting. I feel sad, but I must defend myself. I try to knife his balls. He dodges. He's a good-looking man. I'm attracted to him but he's clearly trying to get at my boyfriend through me. [BL]
