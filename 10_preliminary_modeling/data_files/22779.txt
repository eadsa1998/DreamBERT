I was in a room and I saw two of my classmates suddenly and we started to talk about clothes. I saw I was putting on a pair of light brown men's slacks (striped with red). I tried it on and found that it was too big, and I immediately thought I would fix it up and wear it. I also thought that fashion these days is very similar for both sexes.
