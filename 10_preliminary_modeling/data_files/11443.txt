I was in a classroom taking an exam. Everything went smoothly until I hit the last question which involved the use of some mathematics since the problem was one of the applications of pressure to a gas and its consequent compression. I worked on the problem for what was a long time in the dream and was not able to finish it in time. As I read this created a great deal of anxiety.
