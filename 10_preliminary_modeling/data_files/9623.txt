I am a SERVANT in a large household: Father Andrew comes as a guest. I have to serve him coffee and cookies. He is nervous and sits at a table. I forget to bring him a spoon. I also have to put away the candles. There are many rooms, tables - them move to a different house: Father Andrew comes to visit us; I loan some girls some soap.
