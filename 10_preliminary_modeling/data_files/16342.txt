Originally I thought that this dream was way too silly to put on this tape, but now that I've had enough conscious time to mull it over, I think it'll be okay. Matter of fact, let me say that, first of all, this dream was the first one that I've ever thought was too silly to put on this tape. [laugh] Here's what it was: I dreamt that I had to go to Grad Night that evening, which really is what is today, but before I went to Grad Night, Dad put this responsibility on me that I had to prepare this like little pizza thing in the fry pan, and I also had to turn on the air conditioner. And how you would do it is you would light a torch and you would kinda light the air conditioner with a torch, and the air conditioner, we called it the Hossle (?), so I had to take this torch -- believe it or not -- the plastic end (?) -- this gets sillier! There was this prize that I won from a raffle that was a little pocket torch keychain, like a cigarette lighter, except when you turn it on, it smells like a torch. And they called it a portable cruise torch. So I was using this portable cruise torch to light the Hossle and so I think I had to like turn it on and I got it near the air conditioner and it didn't light. It was starting to like get out of control and so I like threw it in the water to put it out, but it wouldn't go in the water. I ended up shoving it into the side of the blue cabinets, flame and all, then there was a towel close by and then I realized that it might burn things. So I took it and I had to like, it got stuck like a magnet there. I had to like pull it off. And I threw it outside and I never did get the Hossle air conditioner lit, and I know there was more. I think I was trying to fix some kind of food for somebody, and I think somebody was coming to town, but I don't remember anything more.
