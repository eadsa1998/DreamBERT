I was driving my wife's automobile down one of the more busy streets in Cleveland. What street it was I cannot tell although I am very familiar with the municipal thoroughfares of Cleveland. Snow blanketed the ground and the streets shone like glass. Suddenly the car went completely out of control and a dense fog appeared before my eyes through which I could see oncoming headlights but nothing else. Everything appeared to be gray and the car began turning complete circles as rapidly as a whirling dervish. Vainly I attempted to get the car under control but the more I tried the more the car spun. I began getting sick to my stomach and waited for an accident to occur but nothing happened. I heard horns blaring and people shouting but from whence they came I knew not. The car stopped spinning and I woke up happy to discover that it was only a dream.
