I was in some kind of pageant or play in an auditorium.  It was a military affair, and we wore uniforms and carried guns.  A battle was part of the scenario, and sometimes I couldn't tell whether we were acting or whether it was for real.  At one point, for instance, I couldn't find my rifle and was very much afraid I was going to get into trouble.  Then I found one, but it didn't have the right serial number.  I finally did find mine.
