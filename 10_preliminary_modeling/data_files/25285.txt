 I'm in the Olympics playing tennis. It is me against a star player. I don't use a racquet, and I do okay. Then I have to jump over the net to get to a shot, and I don't make it. I start using half of a racquet, broken off at the handle. I don't do well at all like this. I can't serve the ball. We are playing over water. I push some metal doors forward to get more room to serve. I don't score a point in the final match. I get beaten very badly. My dad is in the crowd. My last serve nearly hits my grade school principal, Candy Bevner, who is near or in the water. I lose horribly, but he crowd cheers for me, to be nice. My dad says I got smoked "royally", which somehow a joke on a royal flush hand, in poker. I have never completely failed at anything in life, until now.
