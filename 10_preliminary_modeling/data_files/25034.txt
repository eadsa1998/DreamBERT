 There is a young man in the military. He is a specialist who does something with cows. He gets fined $130 a month for something he did. Two officers with nightsticks chase him. They beat him. Later, he is chased again. This time he is chased down Hill Avenue towards 3rd Street in Oak Valley, which is one street over from where my home is. The man is then Charles from my Geography class. He gets the cop's nightsticks somehow. He is chasing them. One officer lags behind, and Charles goes after the officer in the lead. He chases the officer into the garage of my neighbor, Alvin Broud. There is white powder all around. If the powder gets sucked/vacuumed up, that will be detrimental to Charles, so he breaks all the lights above his head. While breaking them, most of the powder gets sucked up. The officer gets away. Charles walks into the Broud's house like nothing happened: cool and collected.
