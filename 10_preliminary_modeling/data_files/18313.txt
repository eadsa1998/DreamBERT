An involved dream about two girls who were cheating jurists out of money, blackmailing them in some strange way. A corrupt family in which these two sisters brought their daily earnings home to their father. Also a young man was involved somehow in these dealings, and it seems there was some sort of sexual attraction between him and me. It was a mixture of reading about the episode on a poster, seeing it, and being involved in it. Linda and Lori were in it too. I was taking care of them and telling them a story about a pumpkin who lived all alone in the forest, with vine arms and legs. He wanted someone to like him and play with him, but no one would because of his scary Halloween face. A dog and a deer ran away from him. The kids weren't paying too much attention to my story, so I never got to finish it, but the ending was going to be that a little boy would come along and take the pumpkin home to be his jack-o-lantern.
