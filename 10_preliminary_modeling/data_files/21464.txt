I was at the race track betting on a horse by the name of Bob's Birthday. It was a $25,000 race. But there seemed to be no rider and they wanted me to ride him. I never rode a horse in my life and I was nervous. I thought of falling off and I also thought I would win my race and bet. There was a man that was a rowdy. He teased everyone, especially me. He finally had me, a policeman put him in jail. He was angry, but that seemed to be the only cure for him. I had some kind of contraption that had a handle on it or it was glass squares attached to a slingshot handle and inside these glass squares there were rocks or stones. I was looking at them and couldn't make it out, what it was. I was waiting for a streetcar in Fairchance, PA. One was coming, so I hurried to the stop. When it stopped, there was a crowd waiting to get on and they all got ahead of me. I thought I would change my position and get on the car sooner, but I ended up with some kids marching by from school, so I went back to the old crowd. I was looking for the men's room and there were mostly women in the rooms. I was changing my pants, had them off when a woman came in. I hid my legs behind a corner or wall. Then I got to my locker and changed my pants. I was late when I came to where this woman was and she was still there with a clean pair of slacks on. I patted her on the rump as I went by.
