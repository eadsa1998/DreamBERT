I was on a Euclid Avenue streetcar about 9 o'clock on a Wednesday morning. Suddenly a girl in one of my classes came up and sat down next to me. We talked about school and then she had to get off at Abington to go to Clark Library. I noticed how exceptionally nice she looked as she jumped off the street car because she was wearing anklets and loafers. This was unusual because she works part-time and always wears black shoes and stockings.
