       We're still in the neighborhood, and we come to a corner where a group of people are outside, all dressed up in costumes - mostly fanciful, like SCA or fantasy - one girl seems to be Morticia Addams-like. There's something like a garage sale going on [though I think it's more than that], and we know a few of these people somewhat, so we stop and talk to them. Inside, Jenny's met up with somebody she knows well, and she's hitching a lift back with him. (It seems to be Mel Torme - he's here, but she hasn't said it was him.) [There are big tables in here, piled with big things like maybe carpet rolls or something. It's a bit musty and there's a yellow light, as from a single bulb. Warm.] I say, "You don't want to ride with us on such a nice day?" - I've been teasing her for some time about keeping up the pace, are we going too fast for you?, etc. She says, "I'm a needy smoker - I've got to have a cigarette". We all laugh, tease a little more, we plan our next route.
