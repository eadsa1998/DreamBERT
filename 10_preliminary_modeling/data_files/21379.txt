I was by Charvats and there were a lot of snakes. One crawled up my leg and up under my shirt. We looked for them and I saw a pot around. I looked into it and there were snakes in it. I said, "Put in on the stove and boil it." That's what we did. I was in a field with Bob and there were a couple fellows knocking a ping pong ball with sticks. I had a stick and I ran for the ping pong ball. I went to the men's room and urinated and it was an odd-looking urinal.
