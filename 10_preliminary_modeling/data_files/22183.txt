Today I dreamed that I was with a young girl, thin, with short hair, about 16 years old. She was wearing a skirt and a short-sleeved sweater, and low heels. Both of us were in a room with no furniture; the only thing I remember is a small table which came up to about our knees. We were standing, facing each other on each side of the very small table (it was about two feet long and 1 foot wide) and I was telling the girl, "Today I have to remember my dream, because I have to tell everything." She kept staring at the table where there were some blank papers. At one point I took the papers and continued talking to the girl about more things that I don't remember. The room was big and dark. The two of us were in the middle, to one side of the wall.
