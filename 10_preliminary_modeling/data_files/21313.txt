I was in the basement of the shop. It was dark there. I used the light. It was creepy there. We kept the tools there. I heard a voice say "John" and I yelled, "What?" and it said "John" again, so I said, "What do you want?" and it said, "Up what?" I said and I said, "Up again," then it dawned on me an up horse.
