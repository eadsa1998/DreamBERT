I had a dream that I was on the subway on my way to Suffolk. On the train I saw a friend that I have not seen in about a year. We started to talk but I can't recall about what. We finally came to the station,. When we got to the street he walked a different way. I followed him and continued to talk to him. Finally when I realized how I was so far off track I told him I had to go to school. He was going for a job interview. Then I woke up.
