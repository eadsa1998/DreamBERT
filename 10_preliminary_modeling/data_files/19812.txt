I was in a modern house owned by a man. A room had been converted into a garage. Angular halls led to a wall where there were 2 valves, one for oil and the other for water. A young woman wanted some oil. I turned the water valve by mistake and the oil and water mixed. A fuss blew, and I had to go and buy another. I had a 4 dollar bill, but I didn't want to change it, so I looked for other money in my wallet. (When I awoke, I thought it odd that I had a $4 bill.)
