Double dating with a fraternity brother. I was with a tall blond 5'9", just a little taller than I am. I was going to a scheduled party. Just before we went in we got to laughing about height; the girl said it didn't make any difference. The girl was Marcia, from home, and I had never been out with her or consciously had a desire to do so. At this party was a girl I had been going with just recently. She was wearing a red dress (part of costume for skit told me in advance). Nothing has been said at all about our not dating anymore. Since I leave her alone and concentrate on other women, particularly my date, she begins asking questions as to why and what and why I am moody. I answer that I am not moody or particularly avoiding her.
