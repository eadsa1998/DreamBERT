I'm doing visual research in the medium of cut paper and card, at a shopping centre - it's a pedestrian square of shops that's full of middle aged and old people - many of them tourists. My aunt Catherine worked in a Chinese restaurant in the square. She tells me to go and draw or take photographs of a troupe of Chinese dancers in the square. I watch as a group of uninspired men go through the motions of a tourist-orientated piece of choreography.
