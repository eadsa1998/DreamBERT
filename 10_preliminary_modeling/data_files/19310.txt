I was at work with my friend that I work with and my car would not start, and the building was locked so I couldn't call for a ride. Then Dale the dishwasher came out and my friend and I asked him for a ride. So we were driving to my house but my house turned into a bar and we stop there and we went to the bar and he left and told us to stay. He came back with his girlfriend that looked really young and she had long orange hair. She went to the bar and ordered a beer. We were sitting in the far side of the bar. And it was dark. Then my ex-boyfriend come into the bar and sat down across from me. Then I and my friend took a drink from the beer and the cops come and gave us a test for drinking. My friend and I come out positive and cops took me to my house. It turned to morning and my mom and dad were home and yelled at me.
