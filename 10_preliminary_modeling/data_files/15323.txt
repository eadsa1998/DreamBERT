I was talking with Evelyn and mentioned 4chan. Eugene overheard and asked if I'd mentioned 4chan and I said yes. I put pictures of Zoltan on Dad's wall. I went to the cinema and there was a sci-fi movie from the 70s I had seen before and it was bad quality. There was a magnetic storm that had been going on for the last 10 hours. We were sleeping almost outside and had shutters on the 'roof'. There were electrical things in the sky.
