I was swinging on vines near the cars at school. People were watching and Daryl was there. He said "How dare you say such a thing" and laughed. Elijah and Calvin were there too. I was looking for my bag. I didn't know what time it was. I had math, but I had science in a different class. There was this after dinner thing. Everyone had been drinking, even Ezra, except for me. I was getting my desk at 'school' ready to sleep on. There were some Monty Python commentaries on and I taped them. I had dreams of people in cartoon form and they were in a tree and there was something about a foot. There was this creature with a pear for an eye.
