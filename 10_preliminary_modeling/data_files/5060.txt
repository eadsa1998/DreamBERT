I'm swimming in the ocean. I've been shipwrecked and am swimming for my life. Some buoy that looks like a giant bottle is floating and moving away from me. I must catch it or drown, and I do get it and rest on it. I look up and see heavy surf. It is very dangerous. People are boating past me and I yell out, over and over, "Help me. Help me." They don't hear and then I wake up on shore, safe, and I cry and cry in relief. I don't know how I made it alive, but I did. [BL]
