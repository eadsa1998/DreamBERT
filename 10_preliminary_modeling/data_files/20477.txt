I was with my sister. There were broken pieces of china on the ground and I threw them into a ditch. There was a pole in the ditch. The ditch was about 20 feet deep and about 15 feet in diameter. I looked down into the ditch to see what was there. I fell into the ditch. I called to my sister to help, but she said she was afraid to go to the edge of the ditch. I climbed the pole and was able to reach the top of the ditch.
