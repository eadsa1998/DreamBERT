Strange dream about drugs and my son getting involved in either taking or selling drugs. His father is there and Ken is there and it's threatening. I'm afraid Charlie will get into trouble and I'm telling him both that they better watch out for him because he's getting ideas that drugs are okay. There's an implication that both Ken and CharlieÃ•s father do drugs also.
