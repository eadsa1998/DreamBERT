I was at Sandra Bullock's house.  She was gone and I was to watch her animals.  She had a room designated for them.  A creature somewhat like a light colored capybara, something that looked like a flying bat-ray that had to soak in water, and a large squirrel monkey, about 3 feet tall.  There were other animals as well.  Somehow I had to 'rescue' or bring them back.
