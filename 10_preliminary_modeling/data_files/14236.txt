I was walking down the street and there were lots of African kids were walking about. One of them, about three years old, hit me and said "tag, you're it" and I said "I'm not playing!". I kept getting tagged though. I was then at a shop and it had a section with a TV and chairs. It was called 'Cinema for Convenience'. People from school were there. Then there was a house or something there and it was getting blown up because there was a bad guy there. I had something there too, which was getting blown up. I was hiding behind the chairs. This girl got told a code and mimed it to me and I couldn't read her mouth and I asked her again and she whispered it, it was "7355". Some people noticed me hiding but were too busy dealing with the bad guy. I grabbed a big box of Ferrero Rocher and was going to pay for it with the school's money, since they were expensive. The thing got blown up and then we left. I grabbed a box of wafer sticks as we went out. I forgot to pay at the checkout and security came. I used the card to pay, using the code 7355. There was only a limited amount of money though and I couldn't afford the wafer sticks so took them back and got given a marshmallow chocolate instead. We weren't allowed back to the cinema and there was a wall in the way now. It was night. Mom and Ezra were waiting outside in the car.
