 My deer-hunting license gets torn up and run over in a parking lot. It isn't authentic, then, and I'll need to get another copy made. It will cost about $15 to duplicate. I am in a store looking at shotgun shells. I'm in a swimming pool, though I feel no water around me. There are two big white seals or sea lions that are very friendly, and a baby white seal as well. A woman takes a photograph of me with them. They are cute, friendly animals.
