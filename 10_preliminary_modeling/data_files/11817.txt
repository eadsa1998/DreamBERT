I was at home and I was sleeping in Dad's bed and Mom was too. All of a sudden, Mittens screamed and we saw Tinkerbell and Tigger were inside but Dad hadn't let them in. We went back to sleep. I woke up a while later and Mom was gone. I got up and my computer had been stolen, along with the DVD player and the video player. I looked out the front and these men were taking our stuff to these cars. I rang Mom and she wasn't listening so I called the police and they came in about 5 seconds and I got my stuff back.
