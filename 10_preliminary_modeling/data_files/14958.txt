I was at school. I ended up with some older guys and I was helping them with something. Calvin didn't like them. We were in a computer room and I was next to Calvin and this guy I liked was on the other side. He looked like Cory Monteith. We had an in-joke we kept giggling about. There was a 'Top 6 upgrades' and number one was Charizard and then "Ninetails, Vulpix, something I don't remember, Pokemon, Runescape". Later some friend and I went to this caravan to visit another friend, who was Doug from Dawson's Creek. The caravan looked like it had been broken into and he was acting weird. I saw him wipe blood off his hands and I walked down the hall and saw the bath/shower curtain had been pulled to. I opened it and there was a dead guy in the bath. This girl saw it too. I asked my guy friend in and we thought we saw the dead guy breathing. It turned out that Doug actually didn't like this guy and he had come over, but didn't actually break in. I was later driving with Mom and I said something, but I can't read what I wrote -- "that's my [something something]".
