A group of people are in a circle, two of them in wheelchairs. A man teacher asks students if they are prepared for today's lesson. He asks a boy in a wheelchair. The boy says, "Oh, I couldn't because I didn't get my check yet." "You understand," the teacher responds. "No Gary, I don't. I speak English." Then there is a toy-like game. I'm it. Someone puts a thing in my arm and I drive around in my chair, lamenting, "I can only go 4.8 m.p.h. How can I win?" Everyone else is running and faster. Somehow I do manage to keep out of their way.
