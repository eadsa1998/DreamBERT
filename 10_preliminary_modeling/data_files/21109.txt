I looked into my pocket and it was full of money loaded with bills. A friend of mine was giving me tokens, passes and silver for streetcar and bus money. I saw a river that the water was forced into it. I watched it and the force and volume was terrific. The current was so swift in the river, I thought it couldn't make the bend in the river, but it went around it. A lady came to me and kissed me. I said, "You better watch yourself because my wife is here."
