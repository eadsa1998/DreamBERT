Some friends of ours were coming over, friends who recently had a new little baby, and this old friend of ours named John K. who we haven seen in years, who is a physics graduate student. It seems that this John was going to baby-sit with our daughter while we went out to dinner with this other couple somewhere. But we weren't even sure that he was really coming, but finally they did get there, and he was going to baby-sit for us. I was showing him things about the baby -- how to change her diapers and various things. So he and I were talking to each other. While we were, we weren't in the apartment any more. We were in this big building that was under construction. I know it was at night, but there were workmen all over the place. They were all working at something. There were lots of little stairs going up and down and half finished boards and it was fairly dark. Exactly what we were doing there I can't remember. I remember having to go past a couple of workmen who were soldering something with some soldering guns and they had left them there. I was afraid of getting burned. This one workman made this sort of nasty remark to me as I went past. Then I told him he'd better not do that again. Something confused happened next, I don't remember.
