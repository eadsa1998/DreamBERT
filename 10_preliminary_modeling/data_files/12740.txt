Dad and I watched a movie. There was a piece of paper on the back door to see if I had gone out the back. I had some medicine thing in the cupboard that was Michael Palin's or something. It was one year old and there was a ransom note. I was thinking 'Oh my God! I've killed him!'. There were photos of him being tortured. I was going to watch another movie with Dad which had Marlon Brando in it and was supposed to be really funny. I ended up watching the beginning of another movie.
