I was in a sort of gymnasium.  It was set up with tables and stands like a science fair, but it was for cheesecake tasting.  Some of the cakes were amazing.  My dad was missing- had been for months.  I had to leave for work.  I found my father.  There was a lot of blood.  He had been freed by God, so I thanked God.  I drove, and my father was with me.  I asked him to get a Listerine strip out of my purse.  I looked for the building I was supposed to work in.  There were three other people looking as well.  We went into a bridal shop towards the back room.  There were 18 people or so waiting for interviews.  Both of my parents were there.  It was the first day of 'work', but just interviews- I wouldn't even have mine that day.
