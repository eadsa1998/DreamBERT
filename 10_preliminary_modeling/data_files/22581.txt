I dreamt that I was in Mexico. The setting was a hotel (this is a short dream since the only places in which I was in the dream were the elevator and the kitchen of the hotel, but I also saw the kitchen of my house and long corridors which resembled those at the office where my father worked. That place was half-familiar since I saw my own kitchen and those corridors, but I got to Mexico using some tickets that had been given to us). The characters I talk to are my father and an uncle, who is his brother, who arrives there later with a cousin of mine. I remember that I find myself tasting some delicious rice dishes and that later I find my uncle and my father in the elevator and that my uncle tells us that on the other side (of the kitchen) there were much better entrees. I also remember that when I was eating, I saw a group of people (they are my neighbors, even though we are not friendly with them) who looked at us suspiciously when we were eating, as though they would have liked to ask us, "What are you going at our hotel?"
