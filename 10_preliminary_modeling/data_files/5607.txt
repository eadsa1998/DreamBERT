[1997-06-07] On the show "A Prairie Home Companion" (weekly radio comedy show) they must have had a contest where you send in tapes and then they would judge you from there and the winners would go on the show. So, our friend DD who is also blind, and plays piano at many of the night clubs in our area and he was one of the winners. They told him that he could invite some other people to fly out to Minneapolis and be on the show with him, so he chose Mort and I. Maybe because we've been friends for so long. He just gave us a call one day and asked us how we would like going out and meeting Garrison Keilor after the show. That was really cool. We went out there and listened to him play and we did meet Garrison Keilor I think. That was it.
