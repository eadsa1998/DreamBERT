 I'm talking to my classmate Robyn Masters. I explain what lucid dreaming is, and how to manipulate a dream, giving her examples. I talk about willing a car to move, to come towards her. I finish giving her the explanation and she seems dissatisfied. The topic changes to dream interpretation, and she doubts that my methods are valid. There is another skeptical young man there. We talk about looking for something in a dream and finding it because you're looking for it. I talk with them. I feel very strongly for my viewpoint and I try to point out how their doubts are unfounded and invalid. I make a firm argument. There are pictures on a wall. They seem to be like the sand-in-a-frame pictures. Some things may be stuck to the glass. These pictures seem to have something to do with my old roommate Jens Nils.
