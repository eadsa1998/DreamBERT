I tore off a bit of paper and voted "Yes" but when I found the question as to whether the AAUW would have no more meetings until fall was worded so that an affirmative vote would mean I agreed to the discontinuance, I wanted to change and went to ask for a ballot but the two tellers had none ready. I went looking for more paper. C.H. said I would find some on her shelves. Looked but found none. I was walking along the verandah and as we turned the corner, I remarked that I didn't remember the verandah ran on all four sides of the house but then we hadn't lived there since I was seven.
