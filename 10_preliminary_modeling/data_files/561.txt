I am in the town next to my home town in a drug store. Something about buying gas to heat. I get to the bottom of the hill (this town is on top of a hill). We are discussing airtight windows to conserve heat. I have to go back to the town and I choose to climb straight up a cliff rather than walk around the long way. I get to the top and can't get a foothold to get over. I have to go all the way back down. A boy also has to do this. It seems shorter on the way down. I go to a motel and a boy I remember from high school and I woman I know in my town now are working there. I go to bed. I have to use the bedpan and I get feces on my fingers. The boy tells me there are nightgowns (apricot color and marked $10) for free if I forgot mine. I would like one but I have not forgotten mine.
