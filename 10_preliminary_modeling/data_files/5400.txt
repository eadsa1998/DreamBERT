First, I dreamed I was in Honors English and Mr. Winter was teaching us about hyperbole and metaphor. Allison needed a pencil, so I lent her one. Then we were all sitting in class and Mr. Winter called me on a phone at my desk and told me I had to tell Dorothy she was going to die in 3 hours. So I freaked out and started sweating and shaking and yelled to Dorothy to get to a hospital. Hannah was there, gossiping. Next we were all in the dining hall, and I was sitting with Alexis, Pauline, Faith, and Kylie. I was asking Faith and Kylie about the parties they had been to while I had been in Italy.
