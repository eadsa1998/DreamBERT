I was watching La Piscine and some of it was in English. People were complaining because of the way everyone pronounced something, like 'I am teh pool'. There was a scene where Alain Delon was going into the pool and Romy Schneider was going crazy. It reminded me of a scene from Christine and then I remembered that was a different movie.
