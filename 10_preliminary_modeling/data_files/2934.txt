I am somewhere, in a house I've never seen before, and visiting Ginny and Ernie. They keep adding more children and animals to their family. Ernie is sweet caring and accepting. Now we have a Siamese cat and I see her tummy as someone pets her and say, "She's pregnant," now there will be more kittens. A talking collie dog comes up to me and we chat. I pet it and the fur is so short it feels like nagahyde. It is red in color. Now we are going to go shopping, but Ginny is helping rearrange my furniture. I guess we are in my "house." She moves the file cabinets to the left and puts the bookcase behind another piece of big furniture. I point out that it will be harder for me to get to things now. She is involved in the project and we patiently wait until she's done to go. Ernie is very accepting and I feel love for him. We go to the store, like a huge Costco place. I climb three or four flights of stairs and wonder why I'm walking and how I'll manage when I get there. We get to the top and inside and I try to get into a shopping cart so Ginny can push me around. I don't fit.
