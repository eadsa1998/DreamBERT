 I think my friend Melanie McDyss is sick so I go to her room. She's not there, and I leave her a note. I go out and she is coming out of the bathroom wrapped in an orange towel. She seems aloof and absentminded. She goes into another person's room, but quickly backs out when she realizes it's not her room. She walks across the hallway to her room. I'm sitting on a couch. Someone is sitting on a crumpled up blanket on my left, and Melanie is on my right. Melanie is naked, and sits with her legs bent, knees up towards her chest, and her arms folded across her chest. I see the top of her breasts. She is leaning up against me pressing really hard, flirting. I feel awkward: not sure of how I should react to this. Then I realize Melanie is drunk! She giggles as I say this to her: she is very flirtatious. My housemate Stephen and I and another man poke fun at Melanie for being drunk. We dance around her in a triangle. I think it's odd that she is drunk when I thought she was sick.
