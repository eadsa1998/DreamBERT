I was going to the High School, which was located at the junior college. So I get on a skateboard (apparently my only means of transportation) and skateboard to school. I get there in the evening -- there is some kind of athletic event going on. It is fall, and nobody is around, so I skate all the way up to the light on College Drive and "park" my skateboard. I actually parallel park it. Then I step off and think to myself: Anybody could steal it that way! So I put it in my pocket and go down to the track event. I watch a pretty girl running around with the other runners. Apparently this is my girlfriend, and I came down to see her run. Something happens, and I see her being lifted onto people's shoulders. She must have won, I think before waking up.
