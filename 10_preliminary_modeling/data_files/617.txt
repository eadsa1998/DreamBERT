There is an outdoor party at my house. My parents and other people are there. My hair is in curlers. My oldest son is laying on a couch and an old blue pickup, driven by an older man, drives up onto the couch. I am not sure if my son's arm or hip is broken but find out it is his left arm. When he stands up the shoulder is about where the elbow should be. I go to get the license number. It looks like 3563 but I don't get the letters. I call the emergency room. A lady there thinks I am her relative and she is not happy. Then she realizes I am a patient and it is okay. My son says this is a permanent disability and I say I know. My father has stabilized it with a yellow towel under the arm. I go to call the police but can't get to it for some reason.
