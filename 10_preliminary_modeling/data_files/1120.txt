I'm in M City. It's time for graduation ceremonies. I get angry at Andrea and I swear at her. I tell her to fuck off because it's not necessary to be so rough on little babies. She signals that she refuses to be treated this way. I feel guilty that I don't find a nicer way of telling her but I also realize that the only way I'll get heard is to yell it out quickly. She isn't going to hang out and let me talk about it. I'm now driving my wheelchair through the streets of M City, down Main Street. I drive fast and nearly cause a wreck with a school bus. I go over railroad tracks. I then turn and go down the tracks for one block. I'm on gravel and I get hit in both eyes. A narrator tells how this is very common. I get on Main Street. I pass a cafe I used to frequent. Co-worker Tyler is in there. I feel like I'd like to go in there but I'm embarrassed to because I'm in the chair. I drive on by. I get to the high school. There are lots of stairs. Some woman asks if I need help. I say, "Oh maybe. If you stand at the bottom to block me if I get going too fast." I bounce down the stairs in my chair. Then I look for the woman's restroom. I go in. It's very crowded with lots of women and co-worker Josh and one other man. He says, "Well, after the 'women's' sign there was a little 'men's' sign." He reads things literally, so he came in. I feel shocked but try to act like it's quite normal.
