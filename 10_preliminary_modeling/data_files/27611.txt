I was evidently living on a farm. It was very early when I got up and a beautiful day. The first thing I did was to go to the chicken coop and feed the chickens. I started to go back to the house. The scene changed and I was sitting in a car with my cousin (female, age 22). We were watching the people go by--it was Saturday night in town. The band began to play, very much off-key. Everything was quite natural until a horse came on the scene and calmly walked down the sidewalk. Then I woke up.
