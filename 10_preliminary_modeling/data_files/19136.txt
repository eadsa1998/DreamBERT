In trying to recall this dream, the first image was one of a number of elements fused together. Mainly they were a picture of the necks of two people, two of the main characters in the dream. One of them was an older man, and I believe it was Dr. Hall, who was playing the role of a secretary in this dream. The other person was an older woman, heavy set and along with this image there was a picture of a tape recorder. The dream seemed to have something to do with the APA and a bicycle was also involved. There was some kind of a problem regarding, I believe it was, my betting into the APA. The older woman was arguing for me. There was also something about a radio playing. Day residue for this dream -- a good number of the elements derived from a short conversation I had with Dr. Hall just before going to sleep. Mainly the APA, the tape -- the tape recorder, and a character who was, I believe, Dr. Hall, in the dream itself. The older woman, I believe, seemed to be Gladys Friedman whom I had written today.
