["Annoying Howard and the bad gangsters."] I am at a school. I am struggling with math and banking and business assignments. I just don't get it. I am lost. The teacher piles on the homework. I feel overwhelmed. I am home now and I must work on all that homework. It could take all night. I sit on the couch and complain about how I don't understand what to do and how hard this is and how much there is to do. I resist beginning. I tell brother Dwight to turn on the news on TV so I can watch while I'm working. He does it. Then Howard comes in. He wants to watch another show and wants to turn the channel. I snap at him, hey, there are 2 TV's in the house. You can watch your show in the kitchen with the other TV. He is surprised and annoyed. Later, he comes on the couch with me and puts his dirty stinky foot, with black smudged socks on right where I am working. I am sort of wedged in a crack between couch pillows. I snap at him again to get his sticky feet out of my way. He is being a real annoyance. I am angry at him. Now some gangsters come in. They are going to kill me by forcing me to swim in a lake. I can't swim. Now it is Roseanne who is being threatened and I am her friend trying to help her escape. She seems unwilling to help herself. She whines that she can't swim and will die and how afraid she is. I am giving her swimming instructions as the gangsters take her to the lake. I tell her she can float for days and outlast them. She doesn't really pay attention. Now we are in the lake and she has some metal breathing apparatus on and I am swimming with her saying, head out of water, breath in, head under water, breath out. See? You can do it. She struggles. We are going to survive.
