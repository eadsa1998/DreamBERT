A lady was singing and I was next to her. She wanted me to sing, so I hummed it because I didn't know the words. Some boys were singing Scotch songs and I tapped with my feet to time it. I bought some bananas and there were a lot of soft ones. I was putting on some scotch tape with another fellow. It was a large size. Mother's rupture opened up and she urinated thru it and more intestines started to come out, so I stopped it.
