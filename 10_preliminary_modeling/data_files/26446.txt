 I see five or six duck hunters dressed in blaze orange on the side of a gently rolling hill near a small lake. Ducks fly by, sparsely. The hunters shoot one of two of them when they get close enough. I watch. I am in or on the water. I see several seaplanes that fly and land on the water. I am in the water with my cousins the King boys, and others. Planes land close to us. I'm with my sister Heather in the alley that runs between Oak Valley Bank and the pet food store. We're in two or three feet of water. There is a manhole cover near me. People seem to be approaching from the west. I'm on rollerblades near the Hardees at the Uptown Mall. I skate around the building. Heather is with me. We look for my mom, but don't see her right away. Then we're with my mom, and she points out her new car. It is parked nearby, and we go over to it. It is light gray/silver, and slants downward at the front, while the back is higher up. It is a Mazda. My mom opens up the doors for something. I ask about the trunk space. We're going to Hardees, it seems.
