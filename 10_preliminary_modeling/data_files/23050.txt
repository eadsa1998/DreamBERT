My wife Bonita and I were at a filling station or garage, looking at a camper van the owner had inside.  He wanted to sell it, at a very low price.  I couldn't understand why, until I saw that it was made by Univac.  I surmised aloud that it must be very difficult to obtain parts and service, and he admitted that was why he was selling it.  We were still interested, though, and he offered to let us try it out for a few days without charge, so we drove it away.  Right away I could see that it had serious drawbacks.  We were out into traffic before I could figure out where the brakes were or how to control its speed, and I nearly panicked.  I finally found the brake -- a very small, hand-controlled gizmo much like the hand brake on a bicycle.  It was pitifully inadequate.  We got out on a traffic-clogged freeway, and somehow the thing flew above the traffic.  I began trying to nose it down for a gentle landing, but before I could, Bonita became Mother, who fell out.  When I finally landed and got to her, she was lying against one wheel of a parked vehicle, and several people were standing around her.  Part of her clothes, including a bra, were lying nearby.  She was hurt, but not seriously.
