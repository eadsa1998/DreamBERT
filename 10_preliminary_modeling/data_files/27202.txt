I dreamt that I followed a band, leading a parade, down a wide avenue. The band stopped and the small crowd including myself sat cross-legged in the street. A man with gray hair and a gray pin-stripe suit sat near me. I looked up and saw a company: of Ethiopians with regular Roman-like features and grim expressions on their faces riding on gigantic white horses with flags and lances extended ahead of them. They were riding down on us and with only slight concern I crawled to the curb on hand and knees. I went into a picnic pavilion big enough for only one table. I discovered I didn't have any cigarettes with me so I left with a friend of mine a man, 21 years of age, to buy some. We went to a small delicatessen store to get some. While there my mother gave me an aluminum plate, square in shape with the word K---- engraved and embossed on it. When I got back, I showed the plate to a girl which I hardly know and she told me to turn it over and when I did it turned to glass and became an ash-tray. I discovered I had forgotten to buy the cigarettes so I borrowed one from a friend of the boy I had left with. The pack had only a few cigarettes with papers on in it. I took one and then tried lighting one without a paper. I threw it on the floor and watched it burn to an ash.
