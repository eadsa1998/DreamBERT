The kids were coming to town and we were going to go to the beach to get everybody tan. But some people said that they just don't go to the beach, so we didn't, and we were all kind of sitting around the table kind of deciding what we were going to do. And we decided to go scuba diving, and so we kind of stayed on the dock, Mom and Dad and I, while the kids actually went in the boat and scuba dived. They were like anchored and they didn't really scuba dive at all. They just kind of jumped in the water. [laugh] So what the thing was, is you had to jump off backwards off the ship, meaning you had to stand on the back of the ship and face the ship and then jump off without facing the water. That was pretty odd. And also, I think at the same time, they were doing some kind of concert where they had these like mini synthesized accompaniments and various people were coming up to sing. Well, you know Dad and his control factor, he went over and he put on this one song that he liked, and nobody went up to sing to it. He just let it play. [laugh] That was strange. I know there was more, but I can't remember it.
