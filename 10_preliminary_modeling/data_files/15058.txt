I went to school. I was in class and we had this seat thing which floated around the room. Jeremiah came in with other people, including Ms Solomon. Mr Stevenson came into the room and his name was Jumphed or something -- they all had changed a few letters in their names. Then I was driving at night. I knocked on the door of a house and it was little and in random spot, but it was Ms Solomon's. She let me in and there were locks on the windows and stuff. She was on the phone and got off and I said I was here looking for something. We heard a noise and I told her to get down and don't look at it "pretend you're asleep". I shut my eyes and she was like 'it's so long' and I realized she had looked and I was like 'damn it!'. It broke in and I ran to my car. Calvin was there now too and he had also looked. I said it looks into your eyes and sees your 'soul' -- knows what you eat and then eats you. I got in this weird buggy car and wound the windows up and rove away. I didn't know where I was though.
