There was an ice cream truck that every now and then would drive around the city offering free ice cream bars. He would open the double doors on the back of his truck and there was a tower of white plastic drawers. In each drawer was a different kind of ice cream bar. They weren't individually wrapped. Just lying side-by-side in these drawers. One of them was what we used to call Drumsticks. One drawer had Toffee Bars. One had something that had a red coating with white speckles and another just like it in blue. The driver would let you take your pick. Or if you wanted to try more than one you could. I and the person I was with took three or four. As we began to eat one of them we stuck the others in our pockets.
