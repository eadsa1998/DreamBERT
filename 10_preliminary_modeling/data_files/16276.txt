I was going to a concert somewhere. I had the notion that it was at school and it was like somewhere in this auditorium where I hardly ever go. And I was trying to sneak in my mini disc recorder so I could record it, and I was, we were late, so we were rushing around, we were racing through the hallways trying to get to the auditorium, and somewhere on the way I picked up a handful or two or three of gravel from the ground, like stones and sand, and put it in a jar and put the jar in my purse, thinking that when I sat down in my seat and started to rig up my MD machine that the level of the gravel in the jar was going to be the level that I set my VU's at. That was crazy. [laugh] And so we got in there and, first of all, the concert was nothing like I expected it to be, and second of all, there was this lady who, I was taking out my jar of gravel and looking at the side to see how high up the jar it was, and the lady said she didn't want that in there, she didn't want me fiddling around with that during the concert. So I just put it back in my purse, and I just flew by the seat of my pants and started recording. And then, all of a sudden, I was at home, and Dad had this guitar that he sort of knew how to play, and he had it connected to an amplifier. And it was kind of new actually, and then I slowly faded into consciousness.
