I remember very vaguely another dream that I had. It was a sunny day and I went out shopping with my mother and my sister. We were looking at all kinds of stores (they sold all kinds of things). They were the best known places in downtown. We were walking very fast and we did not stop at any stores. A curious and important thing is that the three of us were younger than we are. I was between 11 and 12 years old and was wearing a dress I had when I was that age, and my mother and my sister also were wearing dresses they used to have when I was about that age. I remember I had my mother's hand in mine. I don't remember any more.
