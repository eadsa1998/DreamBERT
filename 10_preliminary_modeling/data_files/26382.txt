 I'm having a party at home. Many people arrive in a short period of time. I shake my friend Tim Zelling's hand there. Three teams show up, with I think are the men's and women's basketball teams and the men's soccer team, from Brimson. I'm very worried, and try to keep the growing party under control, while still having a good time. A small bus arrives with my friend Emerald Reinhold and her friends. I see a woman who I know is a member of the Lawson family, and insist that she leave. I won't allow her to be here because she has a video camera. She reluctantly accepts my authority. There are some people with guns near the garage! I go up to them and ask them what they hell they're doing with rifles. One gun is a deer shotgun, another a rifle with a scope. I tell the people with the guns to leave! They are stubborn. These people are back from the dead. Two of the Peppercorn sisters are there, and say hi to me as I walk around. They seem to be having a good time. A woman comes up to me and asks for a corkscrew. I go in the house with her and get one. She needs it to open a yogurt-like container, which I open. She flirts and puts her arm around me, and I play this down. The people with guns, and with them everyone else, leave! I see a dream reenacted. I know about this dream I see. In it, my professor Grace Kurkowski and others are wearing sexy lingerie, and lying around the lawn. They awaken. This is a nightmare that is reenacted for, and in, my life.
