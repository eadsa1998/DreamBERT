It was Christmas time and we were passing out Christmas presents. We had Uncle Carl and Aunt Joyce and Uncle Charlie and Aunt Polly and Grandma and Grandpa, and Grandpa was doing the passing. And Uncle Carl and Vince and Uncle Charlie were all little boys, and it was like it used to be. Carl got all kinds of nice things and the other two were real jealous. And before I knew it, somehow -- I don't remember unless we changed scenes -- like we were our family and we had all these little things in front of us, and then Dad said, "I'm going to bring the presents out in a little bit," thinking that it was the big one. And I also dreamt that the magnifying machine in the dining room was a computer and that it was on and I had to hit control-alt-delete because something went really screwy, and then I remembered, and then I woke up.
