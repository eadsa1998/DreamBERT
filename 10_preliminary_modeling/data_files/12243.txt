I was at Nana's as were people from school. I was somewhere watching Nosferatu which had completely random added dialogue. Then it turned colour and I complained. We had sports photos taken and we had to line up depending on how good you are. Daryl was in a bus alone. I asked him if he wanted to come with us. We went down this sand and waited for Dad, but a bus came.
