I dreamt I was in this big building place with lots of people and everyone was scared of something. I had to go to the bathroom. I wouldn't go unless someone went in and made sure no one was in there and it was safe. No one would do it. Finally some man went in looked around and said, "Fine." I went in, turned around and saw some guy staring in the window. I screamed and ran as fast as I could. I ended up on the subway. I took a different line than normal and even got off at different stops so they couldn't find me. And then I woke up.
