I am a civilian on my way to work in the dark on a road crowded with many other pedestrians. People begin to sit by the side of the road; something has happened. I search for a friendly or familiar face to inquire, then sit on a bench next to an older European man. He tells me a plane has crashed over an airport and that all flights have been canceled. Next, I look up and see many helicopters, as though there is an enormous combat assault taking place. I board a small Loach after it appears it is not taking passengers. I am now loaded with combat gear. We fly in part of the combat assault formation and land on a base. There is no combat but it is unclear when and where we should go. An Asian man directs me down steps to an empty high school lab. I throw down my gear and try to sleep on a lawn outside. I am woken by a solider tugging my arm. He is upset over something I have caused. It is not serious and the solider is not angry, only concerned. Recollection ends here.
