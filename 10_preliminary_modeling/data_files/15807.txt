I was at a petrol station with people from work. It was night and we weren't working but it may have been on a break or a travel job. Marvin was there with his girlfriend and they kept hugging and kissing. We all bought some stuff and mine came to $1400 but there was a problem with my card. Then I realised it couldn't have been $1400, because I'd only bought a $200 thing and some chocolates.
