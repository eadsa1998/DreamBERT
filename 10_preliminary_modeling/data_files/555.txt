I am at a hospital board meeting in my hometown. A childhood girlfriend is with me. There is also a skating rink in the area. Two board members decide to swap wives and go to a little motel unit at an area to our left. I am now in a car and trying to indicate my disapproval to a person in the car with me but can't get their attention because I can't speak because I can't breathe. I realize I am actually lying on my back at this point and try (still asleep) to roll over and open the car door, knowing if I can fall out and get upright I will be able to breathe.
