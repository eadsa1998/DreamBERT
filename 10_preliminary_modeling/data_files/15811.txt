Mom informed me about some job that Acquaintance-F-08 had organized (an illegal one) and they needed someone to go in and collect whatever it was. This was the riskiest part of the job and somehow I ended up involved. I had to go into this house to get the thing (or whatever it was I had to do). While I was there, the guy came home with a woman, and the wood door at the front wouldn't close, so I had to leave it and go out the back way. I ran across the road where there was a McDonald's and some other things. At some point later, Acquaintance-F-08 contacted me blackmailing me for all the money I'd get (which was $300 million). Not wanting to cause problems, I said 'how about halves' and she said no because she could buy some sword for $500 million and sell it for a lot more. I said 'fine, I'll take $20 million' and she still said no. I told her she was being ridiculous because she could still buy her stupid sword and even $20 million was more than enough, and for me it would be enough for life, but she wasn't budging. I said I needed time to think about. Then I got in contact with Jordy about it and he said to meet him at this place with a weird name at midnight. I had to ask him about a few times the name of the place and where it was and then I realised I didn't know what day and he said 'tonight'. It was some place where we'd know people weren't listening. I don't remember the conversation or the conclusion, but afterwards I realised I didn't have a car. Dad appeared out of nowhere, also without a car, and walked with me to get somewhere to call a cab. A guy and some girls were posing for photos on the sidewalk. The girls were dressed skimpily in leather but looked about 12.
