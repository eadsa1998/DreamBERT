I am asked to be in a role play for a man who has flunked out of law school. I hold my script and do a very excellent job of a funny voice. People are impressed with my improv talents. 3 of the fake "judges" gather around me as I act. I think, hmm, sex always brings them interest. Merle is in there somewhere.
