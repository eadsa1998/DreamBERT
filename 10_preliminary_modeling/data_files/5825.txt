[1970's] I was out in a field, possibly 1977, a lot of grass around and there were a lot of dogs in the area and there was a pile of stones around like somebody moved in and was building a road, not too large stones. I remember picking up the stones and just hurling them violently at these dogs, making every attempt to kill them and feeling very good about it and the dogs were barking. I cannot remember them trying to come after me. Especially this one dog, and from his bark it seemed like a very big dog, a big bark, but it stayed its distance and I must have hit it which I could do only with luck in real life. They didn't run away from the stones that I was pelting them with. I'm not particularly a dog lover but I certainly wouldn't want to harm the animal.
