I was in a barn. I peeped around a corner and there was a big bull. He was as big as an elephant. He saw me peep and he came around the corner, but was tied and I moved away fast. Bob was skating. He had an old pair for me, but they wore in the center on both edges. I walked on a slippery road, then Bob and his friend came back and I walked with them. We came to a place where we had to shoot the police. One was coming at me, his gun pointing at me. I was nervous when he was going to shoot me. Finally, one of my friends shot him. He fell to the ground. Then we came to the chief and he said we would have a big crowd if the weather was not bad. Then I noticed the dead cops were getting up. They were not shot. It was a masquerade. I was walking with a fellow who was tall or big. He was about 18 inches taller than me and a girl was also taller than me.
