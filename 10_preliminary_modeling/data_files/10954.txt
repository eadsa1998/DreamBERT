I dreamed that I had 3 huge pimples over my right forehead. I was very anxious to get rid of them because they were painful and ugly. Meanwhile my mother was talking about the great need there was for teachers. She thought my sister would make a good one. Then it seemed as if I was taking part in a movie. Humphrey Bogart came in with 2 thugs. He came over to me, then grabbed me and poured some rubbing alcohol on obvious bumps on my head. I was angry and felt the pain, then the bumps slowly disappeared.
