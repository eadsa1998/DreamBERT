I am at a doctor's office. A man and a woman are in at the same time. I leave and realize I forgot to tell him something. Annoyed I think it was because they were there, wish I had told him. "I'd not talk till they were gone. Shall tell Dr. next time." But it's not too late. I've got to see him. Another patient waiting complains, "Isn't he thru?" Nurse says, "I'll see." I see R. waiting. I ask, "Have you been waiting long?" She says, "an hour but I had an accident." "What was it?" But R. doesn't seem to know me. (I'm planning to see Dr. next Tuesday.)
