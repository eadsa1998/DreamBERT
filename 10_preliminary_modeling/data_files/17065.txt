I was in my grade school gymnasium playing soccer with indoor soccer balls. I was playing an individual game where you scored points, but I was playing against a guy who I played soccer with and against until I was 15. We each had a ball. There were two goals, one on either side of the gym. We were running really hard back and forth. The coach kept saying it was the new sport that would make you tough.
