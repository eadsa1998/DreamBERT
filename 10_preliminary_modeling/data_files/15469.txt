I was at Comic-Con, which was different. There were lots of guests and they were all split into different locations. Morena Baccarin and Nicholas Brendon were there. James Masters and someone else were in another spot. I got there early but they weren't coming out until later. There was a movie playing and as it ended, I snuck out. There was a long line to buy tickets, but it was moving fast. I didn't know what to do so I asked if we had to buy them now and they said no. I walked past and then I realised I was supposed to, but I'd already gone. Someone asked me what my dog was called and I said Rover. Spaceman was climbing on me on the floor. Morena Baccarin stroked him and accidentally touched my face. I posted a status on Facebook about whether I should get her autograph. Some random person commented saying 'why don't you make the decision yourself' and a long comment. Nicholas Brendon had a starshaped piercing. I was hanging with them. I was trying to find an ATM and asked Morena but she didn't know. Someone gave me a stamp. James Masters was at his booth signing stuff. Nicholas Brendon had to leave, so he was replaced with Matt Morrison who joined us. I left to find an ATM and found one backstage. There was a horse and I said 'do you own a horse? I disconnect'. I opened a door and it moved and looked more like a pony. I said the horse escaped and they chased after it. There was a shop and a black woman swiped a key card and got money out.
