The power went out. I got my flashlight but the batteries were going dead so I went into the office to try to get two fresh batteries. I realized there were ants everywhere. It was really freaking me out, even though ants don't bother me in waking life. They were all over the carpet, climbing up the walls, in the closet. I just kind of dumped the bag of batteries on the floor. I couldn't find two batteries the right size for my flashlight. I made my way downstairs. The ants were down the steps, climbing up the hallway walls, all over downstairs. So I was trying to move very quickly and get into the toolbox and get that flashlight so I could get into the breaker box and flip the breakers to try to get the power back on. While I was trying to get to the other flashlight Matthew came down and wanted to know what was going on.
