 I'm going to a mall with others. We are taking a station wagon and a van. My ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas, and a German woman I know from Brimson, Kate Francis, are among the people going. We walk out to the two vehicles from my house. Annie grabs my hand and pulls me into the station wagon. The cute woman I see at Mason Cafeteria with long brown hair and acne scars is there too. I sit in the middle seat with Annie. In the back seat is a bunch of stuff. It seems like the Brock family's stuff. Kate is in the front seat, and we talk. We wait at a restaurant at the mall. Kate is sitting on my right. My mom approaches us from my left side. She criticizes Kate, without knowing she is on the other side of me. I defend Kate, and verbally attack my mom. There are two guys there who are leaders, and my friends Hank Anderson and Norman Noman, who just ordered a pizza because they couldn't wait any longer for real food. My mom talks to Kate, and tells her that she (Kate) has to leave. I think this is crazy! I leader calls me to the Blue Gem in the mall. I go and walk over to the Blue Gem, which is a fountain-like attraction that looks neat. I find the leader. It turns out the leader, who is a woman, wanted my brother Wally instead of me. My friend Holly Lapson is there. I walk by a shoe store, where today, one brand of shoes is selling for $20 more than the other.
