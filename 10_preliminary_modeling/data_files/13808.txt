Nana sold her house because they couldn't afford it for much longer. They had a 'business' running out of it (eggs, etc) and Asians had done some bus thing where only Asian's could take the bus to work. I don't know why that mattered. Her new home was a bit bigger than Granny's old house, which I mentioned to the others. Poppa was there. They explained they had room for Aunt Sally and Dad if they wanted to stay (which were little two story blocks). We were all out the back and the backyard was still the old house. They had to fix it up and then the old house backyard would disappear. I was thinking we wouldn't be going up there anymore on Sundays.
