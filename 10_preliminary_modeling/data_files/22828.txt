I am with a circle of kids in a clearing.  It seems like church camp, or at least kids from camp.  There are lots of pretty girls.  It is very hazy or foggy.  The kids are throwing a red ball a little smaller than a baseball into the air and letting it bounce on their heads.  Each time, it bounces straight up almost as high as it came from.  No one seems to be able to catch it.  I am sure I can, but I can't see clearly when I look up.  I finally track its general direction and get close enough for it to hit my hand on the bounce upward.
