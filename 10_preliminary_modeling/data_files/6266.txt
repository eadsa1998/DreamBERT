Recalled that I had a fight with my girlfriend and she wasn't talking to me. Both of us took off and went home. All through the night she kept on calling me. When I answered the phone she wouldn't talk, so I kept on hanging up. Finally I couldn't take it anymore, so I unplugged the phone. She then started beeping me on my pager so I shut that off.
