["Don't Discriminate."]  Charla and I are in front of a building. We are getting ready to walk to school. I can't find  a paper where I'd done an outline of my homework. I ask her to help me find it in the piles of paper on the sidewalk. She's not very helpful. I look and finally find it. Now we walk up the front steps and into the house. The Casey family is having a reunion. I go into a room and see them gathered near a table. I am offered a piece of chocolate pie. I ask is there sugar in it? Then I laugh. Of course there is. Who do I think I'm talking to? It is Grandma Casey who sugars everything. I say I have to get Charla off to school and leave. I can't find Charla outside and  Rochelle drives up to the building asking me where is the accessible bathroom. I tell her of three different ones on different floors and decide to walk her there. We go in and wander around but end up going out the back of the building and into a bus. I realize I'll be late for school now and get off the bus. We enter another building and have a hard time finding a ramp, which is rickety and crude. We go in and then I come out the other side. This time at the curb I have to jump down over there are a line of cats lying, relaxing. I go around them so as not to hurt them. Now I'm at the school. I enter the classroom and see the students in three circles. They are choosing who goes in what circle. I see Charla there and am relieved. I had wondered if I should return to the original building or go on to the school. I hear a snotty young teen woman say We aren't ever going to choose a granny in a wheelchair. I get righteous and say loudly that is against the ADA discrimination law. You can't do that. They don't care. They don't want anything to do with me.
