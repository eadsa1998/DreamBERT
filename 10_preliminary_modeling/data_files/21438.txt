We set out three different items outside and it was stolen each day.  We were being attacked by bandits. One of them was sneaking up to the window. We were shooting. He sneaked up and stuck in his head. I hit him on the head with my rifle stock and in he came. It seemed to be a friend of ours. We looked at different guns. He picked one up and said he liked the stock of this one. I looked at it and pointed it at a target, which was above a stairway. The sight was big and it covered all of a small target. I didn't shoot because I said someone could walk up to the top of those stairs just as I shot and I could shoot them, and sure enough someone did, some children. So I pointed the gun at any there target and I noticed some children around this tree, so I didn't shoot again. I didn't want to frighten the children. The sun was shining.
