I was in a big, open space and the sky was weird cloudy blue. The sky looked like something right out of a science fiction movie. I was in a gigantic pool of water, collecting donation money for a philanthropy I was working on. I was expecting a lot more money than I received, but I collected well over fifty dollars, which surprised me. Then I was on dry land and celebrity Tim Robbins and my closest friend at the university and some other woman were there. Tim Robbins was squatting because he was so tall. We were standing around in hopes they would give us some money.
