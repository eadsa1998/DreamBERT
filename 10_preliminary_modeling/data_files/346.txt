I'm with a bunch of girls at a house, it's something like a birthday party, we're all talking and laughing. I go outside and over to the landing where I'm to get on a boat with a man (my boss? father? boyfriend?) and a couple of other people, but I've been delayed and they're already pushing off. They're too far off for me to jump on and can't come back now, but I figure I can just step over to the dinghy and get on from that. He and they are waving and shouting to be careful, I'll tip it over, but I think I can do it. It's harder though, because I'm wearing high heels (black pumps). I do manage to get into the thing, just on the side, making it lean over so the far side is in the air, but I wait and it stabilizes. Then I take another step to the center, but that's too much and it goes right over. Just in time I jump back onto the edge of the landing.
