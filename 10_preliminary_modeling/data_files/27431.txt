My husband and I were sitting at a table in a nightclub. There was a girl sitting at a table next to ours who was being hunted by some gangsters. A friend of my husband's who was sitting with us offered to help her escape. He and the girl left the club in his car. My husband and I then took his wife home to their apartment. When we arrived, the girl was waiting for us.
