I was at school outside these fences. Calvin and Samantha were there. This teacher was saying that people who didn't go to the Year 11 ball, couldn't go to the Year 12 ball. I was talking to Calvin and Samantha about people who I write in my diary and Samantha kept saying "Eugene" and "Ooh", which got annoying. She had a different boyfriend.
