There were several bicycles. They were talking of going cycling. I decided I wouldn't go as I never had cycled. I asked L if she had ever seen Betty's Sun, Wind and Cycling. She hadn't, so I hunted for it. Not in that pile of photo albums. "Where it is," and I pull it out from near the top of the pile. L. remarks on how thin it is.
