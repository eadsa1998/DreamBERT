There was continuous flashing like heat lightning. I was at Al N.'s quarters. The place was dirty. Al was a car salesman. I looked out the window and I saw Grandpa Evans walking on his toes, coming to see me. Mary told me that the horse was not going to win. He was a sure favorite. I can't recall the name of the horse. I saw Franklin and some other historic personalities. Franklin said Carter said he would like to earn a lot of money quick and retire because he had to keep an eye on Denny. I wanted to dream what pp was going to win the 3rd race. I saw all the 1 p and there seemed to be more than one pp, like two or three ones. I thought of one and 1 pp seemed to come away from the other numbers and stood out by itself.
