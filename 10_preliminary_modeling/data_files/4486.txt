["Fickle lover."] Michael J. Fox is in love with a woman. I/a woman come into the room. He decides he is in love with me. I am distressed that he could fall in and out of love so easily. I like him but I don't encourage him. The group is having a discussion about how to label something. One is about the definition meaning women are better. The other is about how men are better. I try to articulate a third option of individuals regardless of gender being judged on their merits. I have trouble getting my idea spoken cogently. I tell them I will rethink it and come back with a clear definition. He follows me around. I decide to go out on the lunch break and help the men workers pick beans. I find the place on the vines where they had stopped working for the lunch break. I know this is it, because the ones they picked are stacked up on bookshelves in the vines. I leave them alone and pick more, putting them in a metal platter. It fills up quickly. I then look at the interesting books on the book shelves in the vines. I see some of my library books were mistakenly placed with the other books and pull them off the shelves.
