 I'm sitting on the south side of Carter Church in the front right section of pews. It is second grade graduation, and all the Carter School classes are there. The second graders rise and sit, rise and sit, shouting out words as they stand. They are all happy to graduate and emotions run high. I see a kid who I know to be Jake Meyer, the younger brother of my grade school classmate Jana Meyer. He has a full, thick, dark goatee. He is 10 or 12 years old. There is a preacher who talks. His front teeth are a bit crooked and pressed backwards.
