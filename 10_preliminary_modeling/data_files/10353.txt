Cindy is living in a large hotel and a formal party is going on. I remember bringing in a chococlate cake and eating a piece. I see Father Andrew who is talking with kids and photographing them. I try to find my street clothes but can't find my sweater. I put on one of Cindy's shiny lame dresses-- too fancy for me. I go outside and it is RAINING - I get my feet wet. I find a flimsy door and go inside and find Frank sitting, bored and angry; I leave to go swimming.
