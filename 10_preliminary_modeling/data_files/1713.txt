I am in a swimming pool. It is very crowded. We have to do our exercise in unison to make room for us all! There is an older boss and his son, the younger boss. We are talking, about a war, I think, with China. I draw a big black line around the Canadian border and Michigan Lake on a large map. This is where the outline of the war area is. I marvel at the large spaces they expect to rule now that they have won the war. How will they do it?
