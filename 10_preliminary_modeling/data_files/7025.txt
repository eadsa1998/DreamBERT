I was working a puzzle in my room when glancing at clock saw that I might be late to a dinner engagement. Trouble in getting to toilet. I couldn't make the date if it was at 12. Went to her room to find out if date was for 12:30 or 1 p.m. Mother said, "That was yesterday. We went. Why didn't you?" I said, "It is still Thursday, isn't it?" "No, it's Friday." "But I've been here at my desk all morning. Why didn't you call me." Then I realized I had had amnesia.
