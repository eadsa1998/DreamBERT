I was coming up from my P.E. lesson and time had stopped. When it came back to normal, I went to my locker. People had put stickers all over mine and theirs. My writing teacher came down the hall and said, "I don't know, I just don't know." Setting: At my school. Characters: My writing teacher, very tall and thin. My brother, brown hair, blue eyes, 5'2". Feelings and Thoughts: Wondering. I feel it was weird to have my writing teacher in it and, since we can't decorate our lockers, to have all the lockers decorated.
