 I am in a psychiatric ward. Three prisoners are being transported. I watch. I am uncomfortable. I know something bad is going to happen. The third prisoner, who is a woman, pulls out a gun. She shoots at me. People are slow to help me. The gunshots miss. Ping-pong balls with cotton inside soak up blood form a killing.
