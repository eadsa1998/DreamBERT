A young man calls me on the phone, he's from the SOCIETY FOR THE CREATIVE ANACHRONISM and I've met him casually at an event or party I had once, at some park or school or church or somewhere. He's telling me that we're going to have a visit from a King Estanzia and this is partly an invitation to come, but also he wants to know how or if they can get to use the place I had the party at. I tell him what there is to say about that and ask him who is this Estanzia that I should be so impressed with him - what's he like? what's he done? The guy doesn't answer me, and I rephrase the question, but he still doesn't, and I wonder have I offended him so bad, or has he already hung up, and I just don't realize it? [As I gradually wake up I don't have it in my hand, so I couldn't have been talking to anybody.]
