In the dream I am at war. The terrain is rocky and dry. We are being mortared. The shells fall close. A nearby man who much resembles Ray of the CP [Command Platoon] is struck by the blast of a near direct hit and killed instantly, though his body seizes up, as if he were struck dumb. There is no blood or sign of injury. A second man is killed in likewise manner. No one moves. I run for cover. Recollection ends here.
