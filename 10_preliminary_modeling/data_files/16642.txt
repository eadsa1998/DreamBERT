It was something to do with being by the water, and something to do with the mermaid story, but I can't quite remember that part. The part that I do remember is that Uncle Carl was going to set off some kind of great big -- it wasn't actually a bomb that would be intended to hurt people, but it was like a great big, large-scale loud firework thing, mainly to put on a show out in the middle of the water or something. And I remember in this dream we were in the kitchen, and he was testing one in the back yard, and it made this great big ba-boom and it had this flash of light. And I remember it was so loud it hurt, and I mean I don't know how that could manifest in a dream, but anyway he was trying to do another one that was going to be like twice as big, only this one was going to be at the waterfront. And he like set it up on a little boat or a dock or something, or a timer so that it would go off at a certain time, and I just remember we were with him on our bikes, and we were going to a restaurant and walking along the water and stuff, and I always had this fear in the back of my mind that when this thing goes off, it's going to be really loud and I don't want it to hurt my years. So what am going to do about that? And how can I the farthest away as I can? And in this dream all I could think was Beethoven when Napoleon bombed Vienna, the rest of his hearing went. And I kept thinking, "I don't want to end up deaf like Beethoven." And I think where we ended up in this dream is I was, it was dark and we were by the comfort station, which is like a brick bathroom place downtown. And we were on a blanket and I think we had a little fire going, like a campfire, like a mini one, and I had my big thick cans from Modern Media College and I was going to put them on, thinking that it would block out the sound of that bomb thing. And then I woke up.
