I was at home and Mom was out. I was watching TV and they played I Predict. I sang along to when he sang 'I predict' because I didn't know the rest of the words. Then it wasn't home, with people from school. There were guys outside with some teachers playing sport. I also watched something from Freaks and Geeks with Nick playing sport. Someone came in, who was sometimes Eugene, and he suggested we take off. I got someone to distract the teachers and we snuck out the front door. Then it was like I had gone back in time, so I could drive but I didn't have my licence. I took my car anyway. I kept speeding and having a bit of trouble. We went to the beach, although it had changed. There was a path and there was stuff going on everywhere. I realized I had no pants on. We went to the waterslides, but there were better ones somewhere else. Then I was by myself. The Royal Show was there and I went inside and there were some booths. It was dark. I saw Jason Segel and was like "goo" and pretended to stretch himself. I left and I had a quest to hand in. I had to ask a girl to sing. Across from her, another girl started singing The Breakup Song. I had to go to a tower to hand in another quest. It had winding steps and there were lots of people. I had to vote for the best band on this list, except we weren't allowed to vote for The Beatles or Michael Jackson. I was thinking 'who even likes Michael Jackson?'. There were rows of seats for the 'Superbowl'. I sat in a seat, hoping that the guy I liked would sit next to me, but a girl came and I moved. Cory Monteith and the guy I liked, who was sometimes a young Chris Barrie, were a few rows over and I saw Cory look over at me.
