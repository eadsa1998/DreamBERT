It was the day of my history test. I had studied hours and hours and thought I knew everything. When I entered the classroom, my mind went completely blank. The professor began to yell at me and I became very upset. I couldn't think of one answer and this test meant either passing or failing. The whole attention of the class was turned to me. The hour seemed to last hours. I flunked the test.
