I'm in this elevator with Nick and Aidan. We are in the main building and for some reason we are taking the elevator down to the dining hall. So all of a sudden it stops really quickly and I fall to my knees and am perfectly waist level with both of them. So for some odd reason I think that they want me to give them head and I am really embarrassed so I stand up very quickly. When we reach the dining hall, it's packed with the entire school and then some. So Nick, Aidan, and I get out of the elevator. I'm walking towards the front of the dining hall and Nick is following me, saying, "Hi Bea" and I want him to keep following me and I want to talk to him, but I keep getting pushed so I lose sight of him and then I wake up.
