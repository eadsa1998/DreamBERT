I was trying to get down a cliff overlooking railroad tracks. A man resembling an employee in the hospital shop where I have been working sent an elevator lift to help me down. Later I was walking on the tracks, and feces kept coming out of my mouth. I couldn't stop it, and I was afraid I would have to choke before it would stop. The feces seemed to symbolize the indictment held against me for the crime I committed. It seemed to be telling me that the only way I'd get the indictment disposed of and vindicate myself would be to do something drastic like choking. (I had been hoping the indictment would be dropped so I would not have to go to court when I left the hospital, but I'm certain now that I will have to go to court for conviction and sentencing.) Later in the dream I came to where the tracks were fenced in so closely that should a train come, there would be no place to stand. I saw a train coming, and I hurried to find a part of the fence low enough for me to scale it.
