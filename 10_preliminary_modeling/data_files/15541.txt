It was Harry Potter like - me (Hermione), Arnie (Ron) and Harry were in a building, which I think was our school. I was near a window and someone suddenly and calmly said 'there's a balrog' and everyone started running and screaming. It said it could smell Harry and wouldn't stop until he was dead, so we ran as well. We ended up in these tunnels and there was one that went underwater. Everyone was going in there. The building started falling apart and I went alone into the underwater tunnel, but there were 'spies' there so I went back up. We eventually got away and went to sleep under a tree. We tried lying down, where Arnie would be touching me slightly but it didn't work, so we sat up close to each other and Arnie was leaning on me. Then later it wasn't Harry Potter like anymore. We went to a cinema which was weird and had shops and arcade games everywhere and even a conveyer belt thing like at airports. Then we were at a house. Some stuff had happened that I can't remember and someone said that Arnie was in his room getting stoned. I went in there and he seemed ok, but a little down. We talked for a bit and then we had sex. It 'faded to black' though and the next thing I knew I was waking up with him in bed.
