I was in a Mexican town and there a man was made a fool of when he was a stranger and one of the Mexicans wanted to play you as a sucker. I saw where a man was made a fool of because he opened up his mouth. I think I dreamed this because I saw David Crocket I a movie where their fort was attacked and captured. I was walking by the creek near Stanley Smith's place in Rivertown. I saw Louis Kaufman in a tree picking ripe green grapes and Earnest Kolepin picking cherries in a different tree. I walked into a patch of plums. I picked up doubles and triple plums sticking together. Brother Steve had a flashlight lamp and it had a bright light and he put the light on the plums as I showed them to him. Then I looked at the light and it was like a fisherman's lantern, but a battery light. I was dancing. I only have a vague idea of it because when I awoke I sort of remembered I was dancing. I was dreaming and I know I was dreaming in my sleep. I said to myself I am dreaming this. It is not real. It was night. I watched for a nice girl to go by and had intentions of intimating her. I saw some go by, but not to my satisfaction. I came to a cave. I looked into it. It was a big cave. I drove Bill Kotnik and a couple fellows home from work.
