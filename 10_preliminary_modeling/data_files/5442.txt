Last night I had a dream that I had to go to Japan with my mother for some reason. We drove to the airport, which was at my high school, and I was able to pack everything into this small DVD case. I asked if we were going to drive to California and fly from there, or if we were just going to drive to JFK and fly from there. My mother said it would be better to just drive to JFK. We got onto the plane, and even though the flight was supposed to be 12 hours, we were only going for 1 day. When we got to Japan, I remember that instead of all the skyscrapers, there were these incredible trees from Avatar. They had these phosphorescent leaves that lit up depending on the season. I guess all the seasons went by in the 1 day we were in Tokyo, because the leaves changed from pink, to orange, to green, to blue, which was supposed to indicate a whole year going by. They were beautiful against the night sky. On the way home, my brother and my father joined us, and we all went to a dentist's office together. I don't know why, but apparently the dentists were better in Japan. The dentist spoke English, but all the magazines in the waiting room were in Japanese. The "dentist" was eating yogurt and a Snickers bar, which I remember thinking was weird, since he was a dentist and shouldn't eat candy. This "dentist" turned out to be an old friend of my mother and father's, and we stayed at his house for another night for a party. The dentist was an older man, and I found him very attractive, even though I don't find older men attractive in real life. He was putting all this food on the tables to occupy everyone, and then he cornered me and started flirting with me. I think I had been drinking wine, because I felt a little giddy and flirtatious too. He was wearing a gray suit and looked very sharp. Then I woke up.
