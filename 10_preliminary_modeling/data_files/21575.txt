I was working and I punched my time card to go home and I found out it was one hour too early. I was driving my car on Pearl and Ridge and stopped my car for the traffic light. Ann and Audrey got out and put Judy down on the street. She walked in front of the parked cars. I was riding on a small walker. I pushed myself with Judy on it. I was driving my car and the steering wheel was small, about six inches in diameter.
