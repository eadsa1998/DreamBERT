A quiz program phoned me. I had entered a contest, and all of my answers had been correct. But I could not recall what address I was supposed to give to them to send the prize. While I was looking for the address, the quiz master hung up, and the prize was given to someone else. I saw in the paper about another contest. I was very depressed about losing that prize.
