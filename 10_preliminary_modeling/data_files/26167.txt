 I'm towing a boat, which may be my boat, on a highway. I look back and see that the boat is not there: only the trailer! I turn around and go back. I find the boat on the side of the road. I must have driven carelessly without the strap on back of the boat to hold it down to the trailer. The bow of the boat is smashed in and the motor is broken. A rope on the boat, maybe the motor chord, got wrapped around another smaller rope on or near the road.
