["Stock market crashes."] I am in a room. The stock market has crashed. People are financially ruined. It so happens I didn't do stocks, so I have cash and I decide to buy stocks while they are very cheap and make a fortune. Then I am trying to wash some clothes in a small washing machine. I can't get the side door to shut correctly. The water I am pouring into the machine starts to slop out as I run the machine. The machine falls over and breaks open. I pick it up and fix it. Finally it is working correctly. Now I am showing a book I wrote to a man who is showing me his book he wrote. I think his is about music.
