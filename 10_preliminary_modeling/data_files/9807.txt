Waiting at Church to have a spaghetti dinner: I miss everyone except Reynaldo: I see him walk through with his class and talk to him: tell him to meet us at home. - Undecided: then see huge asphalt machine lay down asphalt on street: I come up to it barefooted: almost get my feet dirty, but see others skip over with shoes on; then I go around it carefully.
