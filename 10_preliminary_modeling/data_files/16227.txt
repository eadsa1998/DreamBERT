I had one of those stupid dreams I could have sworn I've had before. Has anybody ever had some of those? Well anyway, I dreamt that I was sick and that I was going through cards at my desk. And somehow I had the notion that I was in a Bible school for elementary kids. I think that came from Melinda's church and all. But then I had this card that was signed by Celine Dion and I just knew I had to keep it safe with my other memoirs and stuff. And then I had this goofy, goofy card, it said, "Oldies 95.1" and it was like all gold and silver and stuff and it had a hole in the middle where you put -- I don't know -- a pin or something. And then I came back in my room and the clock said that it was 12:45 or some odd hour of the morning, and one of the LEDs was just totally shot so it didn't light up. And [laugh] that's it.
