We were in dorms. I got room 2, Calvin was room 1, and Evelyn was room 3. I was in class and I couldn't hear anything. Someone told me that these people were coming and were going to kill people. I told Calvin and Evelyn and we packed our stuff. This guy came and said everything that the person had told me earlier, again, and he then ripped his face (mask) off. He gave us two packs of sausages. We left as the people were coming. We snuck around this building which was a two storey, motel type building. A woman punched some woman when she opened the door. Some guy asked us what we saw. I said nothing and he let us go. We were hiding in cars and under benches in this cave place.
