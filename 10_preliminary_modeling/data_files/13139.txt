I was in a shop and this bad guy (who was a girl) was trying to kill me and so I was trying to do the same to her, but she was really fast and always dodged the bullets. I was thinking that she had that thing which made you go a few seconds ahead of everyone else (like in Flesh and Blood). When you selected a gun it was like a game and there was a touch screen panel. I got this firecracker type of gun, but I was still missing her. The top of the gun fell off and it had tubes in it (like the lolly things at Seabird). The gun was red. I was running out and I realized that she was going to blow up the shop. I saw Elijah and Theodore standing out side and I told them to run and follow me. I got into this car, which was actually a spaceship. Nathan Fillion and Gina Torres were in there. I was friends with them. Dmitri couldn't drive well on the road. Elijah was like "What's the ship called" and they said "Serenity". There was an intro video of Dmitri and some girl he liked and they were painted green.
