I go into a drug store and demand a tube of Ipana toothpaste. The saleslady tells me that they don't stock Ipana. As a matter of fact it's about the only paste they don't stock, she tells me. Why? She takes a tube of paste, presses it, but the paste doesn't come out of the usual orifice but from a cut in the tube (as one sometimes finds with an old tube). This is indicative of the trouble they've been having with Ipana. I can't remember whether I finally purchased a tube of paste.
