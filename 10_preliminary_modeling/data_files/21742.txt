I was in the country. I looked into a hole in the ground and way down in the hold I could see like squirrels moving around. They were coming up out of the hole and finally came out and, to my surprise, they were chekeetas, a male, female and a cub. They were in a cage and to my surprise Bob was in there with him. I said, "Bob, get out of there. They will kill you." And he said, "They are harmless." He stamped his foot and they jumped back. He opened the gate of the cage and came out. Then later the chekeeta was my pet. I went into the woods with it and he found a grape vine with ripe grapes and we ate them. He made a grinding noise when he ate the grapes. I looked into the sky and I just can't recall now what we were looking at, but it was at something unusual.
