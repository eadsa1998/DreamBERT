I was in the car with Mom and Ezra. We were doing some things before school. We went to get breakfast and I realized it was 12.15pm and Mom had already dropped Ezra off. I was then at home and I asked for the day off since there was only two periods left. I was showing Mom some photos at one point of Samantha and her sister Cyndi. I said her sister was "only 14" as she was wearing inappropriate clothes. We turned down a street and I thought I saw Samantha driving a car. I saw Eugene's car outside of a house and I realized that it was his new house and I tried to take a photo.
