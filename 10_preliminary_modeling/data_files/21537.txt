Fisher and I were on ice. I was not to touch a certain part of it that was sort of a goal or something, so I sort of jumped and then glided about 8 inches above the ice around the ice court. Then Fisher started to play tag. He tagged me and then I would tag him, and he would get after me. We were away from home. I was driving my car around. I tied the dog to a plant. He got hold of the plant and pulled it out. I wanted to know if Barley Nothing would win was picked. Barley Nothing, no. Paytown won.
