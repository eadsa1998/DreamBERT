It was 10 AM. I was due at work at 1 PM. I had stayed home from work yesterday and this morning. I entered the building where I was employed. It had high walls around it. I wanted to phone my employer. I asked where I could find a booth. I told my mother I was going to phone. Later I was sitting on the tracks of a railroad siding outside the building with another man. The siding was not in use, and some ties were missing. I told the other man that they should use this siding. He agreed.
