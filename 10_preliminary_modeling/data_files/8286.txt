Matthew and I were in a car. Someone else was driving. We were in my mother's hometown. I don't know why we were there or where we were going. We were about to pass Grandma H's house and I wanted to point it out to Matthew. We went by it too quickly and I wasn't able to. There was an old house that was very rundown, maybe even a lot of fire damage. The owner was selling it because they didn't want to put the time and effort and money into making it livable again. It seems that maybe BJ bought it. We were driving and I was thinking that there was a house on 3rd Street that was significant. I don't know if it was this one. I kept thinking that I wanted to go by it, maybe to point it out to Matthew. We ended up at this house, I'm pretty sure BJ is the one who bought it. At one point in the dream she is talking about going ahead and moving in right away, as is. Maybe she could live in one room that wasn't too damaged. There is a man. I don't know if it is Uncle H. I think it is because as I'm watching him and following him around this house I'm thinking that he looks so much like Grandpa H. I don't know that he really did because I don't remember much about Grandpa H except the pictures that I have him. I just kept thinking how much he looked like him. I remember seeing him walk up a stairway to another floor. I don't know if he is showing us around this house or if he is just checking it out with us. If he is doing it there was a problem with the plumbing maybe. Maybe we heard noises or rattling that made us think there was a problem with the plumbing. We went into the different rooms. Some of the rooms BJ was going to turn into different kinds of rooms. She might change the old kitchen into a bedroom. She was going to make one of the other rooms the kitchen. The house was still full of stuff from the previous owners. I don't recall seeing furniture but lots of boxes and just a mess.
