A woman and I live together. She might be a daughter. She has a Chicano lover and she's afraid of him. He comes in drunk and has a gun that he threatens to shoot us with. I yell and grab the gun. He gets very angry and hits me and is going to badly beat me up. I dare him to try, but am inwardly afraid. I call him names. The daughter is a total wimp and angry at me for fighting back. I made him leave. I bring the gun in a lake. She says I should have to pay for it since I made it go away. I refuse and leave. He's following me and means me harm. I head for the M City house and go to the front door, hoping my father is around to help protect me. I see he is and I slam the door shut after I get in the living room. I yell, "Call the police!" As I lock the door. "Dad," who looks like Grandpa Mildred, can't find the number. "911," I yell. He tries, but is unsuccessful. The guy gets in and Dad doesn't do anything. Now the scene changes and he and my "daughter" have taken the deed to my place and are using it for their own. He's planted corn in my yard. I say to him, "I know what you've done. It's illegal and I can get a lawyer and get back my land anytime I want." He knows that, so he tries to be nice to me. I hold it over his head. If he doesn't "take care of me right," I yank the farm out from under him. I don't trust him. I'm waiting for him to screw up.
