 There is a television show occurring. There are some episodes of "Stupid Human Tricks" on. There is one episode or incident where there are two brothers who call each other "Chief". I think and say, "Hey, my brother and I do that!" Something happens with my friend Stephen Ramos and Kevin Simpson on television. There are other figures involved, which may be cartoon figures, which seem vicious, abrasive, and acute. I try to take a photograph of what is occurring with them and this character, but it's happening fast and is hard to get the camera to focus. The cartoon-like character seems to be red with big teeth. There is a gathering with several large groups of teenagers and pre-teenagers. Each group is from some sort of organization promoting a cause.
