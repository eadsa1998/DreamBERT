I was with my sister in a building. The furniture was dark. There were counters of dresses and there were offices. My sister drank some medicine to remove some stains on two of her front teeth. Then the stains moved to two other teeth. My sister asked a middle-aged woman about it, and she said that the stains would continue to move from tooth to tooth.
