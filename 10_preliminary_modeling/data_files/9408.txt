I am with an older, 'lecherous-looking' Freudian analyst who wants me to lie on the couch and recall the moment of my birth while he counts 1, 2, 3. I pretend and then tell him the truth. Then he gets undressed and wants to make love to me but just then mother looks in by the door! And I lie very still; she closes the door. I awaken. (Then I remember wishing that I were still with my analyst.)
