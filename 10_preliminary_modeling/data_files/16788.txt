My mother is asking me if I was at an assembly of some sort, which had taken place at school. It was the "Association of Witches" or something like that. I had not been to that assembly, and I was very angry that she would think I was. I had seen my uncle and my cousin at a school assembly in a preceding dream that wasn't so sure, but I didn't think it was this "Association of Witches" meeting. I remember going to a vacation state, or somewhere like that. But I didn't really have to go very far. It's one of those dream things that's hard to understand. I recognize the state somehow. There is a high rock with plants (maybe palm trees) and water. There is plot missing in this dream, but I cannot remember enough to clearly depict it. I now remember receiving a card, a large birthday card (larger than the size of a book) from a male teacher at Center High School. I only know one teacher at CHS in reality, and she's a female. He sent me a card telling me something to the extent that he's happy with what I've managed to accomplish, and that some teachers just don't take their jobs as seriously as they should and those teachers should be fired.
