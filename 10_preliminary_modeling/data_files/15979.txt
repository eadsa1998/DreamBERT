I'm not sure where I was, but there was this huge toilet with stalls in the middle of the room. It was very grey and very dirty. I went in there to pee and as I sat down, another girl came in and asked what I was doing as she got into the next stall, which put me off. Later, there was a screening of some small film but there were some big guests there, like Jack Nicholson. We were hiding behind this wall as we were doing behind the scenes work, and we peeked around the front to see all the guests and we spotted Jack Nicholson and giggled to each other. Later I was somewhere with Technical College people and I was in the water, sort of upside down and Classmate-M-14 poked me in the bum and made a comment and I realised that I'd gotten my period and it was showing through. I wasn't embarrassed but annoyed, and mentioned what had happened as I looked around to find a pad and some clean pants.
