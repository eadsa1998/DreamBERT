Walking down a dark path in an old, other world city. Everything is grey and desolate. I'm holding my cat, Tabby in my arms. Cradling her like a baby. A giant, sinister black crow or raven swoops down and says, "Home, Home," like a CAW, CAW sound crows make but saying HOME HOME and then starts to peck at Tabby's belly. Her entrails were being pulled out by the crow. Laying horizontal in an enclosed truck-bed and my mom and sister [who are both deceased] in the front cab driving. Felt like I was in a hearse. Tried to close the curtains so no one on the street could see me.
