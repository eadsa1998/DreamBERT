Granny was sick and stayed with us sometimes. She did some puzzles and a scratchie. Ezra and I had stopped going out to see her (she was in the games room) for no apparent reason. She told me about some scratchie and she had gotten three words with something I can't read, but lost. I checked it and she thought it was like a crossword scratchie and you only won by getting four words, but you actually got money per word. For 13 words you got $9.5 million. She had gotten all the words. I said to Ezra that I didn't know how to tell her (as she had recently had a heart attack). I said to her "I don't know how to tell you this, but you've won over $10 mil". She laughed with surprise. I had mail and it was something from the bank or the government. It had a number for something. It was night by the way. I checked if the scratchie had expired and it expired on December 9th. The next day, Mom, Ezra, Granny, some others and I went to the place to cash it in. We went to the counter and they said that it was "almost $15 mil' and it was all in cash. We got the cash and went to another room. Santa was sitting at the end of a long table. We gave it to Santa, who was a young guy and was kind of hot. He checked the scratchie but he wanted us to bring it back tomorrow and clean it up a little. He said he was excited because he hadn't seen this big a win in ages. This radio show program was on and said stuff about hosters (it looks like that, but I don't remember what it's meant to say).
