I'm walking and it turns into a journey. First, it's summer and quite lovely. Then, it's winter, with snow and hills. I stop at a cafe to rest. Some idiot man tries to harass me. I yell at him to leave me alone. I'm tired and I don't need him. He keeps it up. I get up and leave. I walk now. I am stopped at a large body of water. I'm trying to figure out how to get to the other side. A man offers a sort of ladder, boat. I put a small baby in my backpack. The "audience" is anxious, hoping I don't fall in the water. I make it to the other side. I mourn the fact that because I'm on a journey I can't take my "things." There are piles of boxes and sacks, small teddy bears, Christmas decorations, etc. Then I leave everything and continue on my journey.
