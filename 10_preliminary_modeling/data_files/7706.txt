I was looking at a picture of Matthew and me standing in front of a tree. He is much younger than in waking life. He is standing in front of me. As I was looking at the photo, another image of me appeared in the picture. I was standing next to the tree, facing it with my arms around it. The second image slowly faded until it was gone. The image of Matthew and me was replaced by an image of Jesus in long robes with his hands open, out-stretched but downward. Suddenly, angels began appearing and disappearing. I was thinking how cool this was.
