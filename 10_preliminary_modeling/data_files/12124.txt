I was at a hotel in the Gold Coast. Ezra and I were in an Unfabulous play. I was Zack and Ezra was someone I made up. I couldn't get the voice right and the people wouldn't swap, but Ezra and I swapped. Someone was killing the people who were originally in the play, then us as well. I went to the hotel to find Dad. The bathroom door was open. I went to tell the lady, but she had been killed. No-one could see the killer except for me, and two friends of mine -- Ryan Cartwright and someone. They couldn't see the killer unless someone had a towel wrapped around their head. There was an evil clown.
