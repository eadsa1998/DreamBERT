I was standing in front of a mirror in the hall of my home (my Akron home) combing my hair. Tremendous amounts came out and when I was through I was practically bald. It didn't bother me much at first and then I suddenly realized that this hair I had lost was lost for life. And there was nothing I could do to get it back. I was then ready to leave the house and I couldn't decide whether to wear a hat or not.
