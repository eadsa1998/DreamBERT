I go into a town on the coast. I've shopped there before, but I'd never stayed so long or go so deeply into the town. I am enjoying the book shop or library. Then I'm in a hotel room. The room next door has a piano and I hear classical music. It's time for the kids and me to take a nap. They squiggle around and are not cooperative. My huge xerox machine is not working right. Copies come out on ripped paper or are buried under old papers. A woman helps me. I finally get a clear copy. I see my cousin Sonja; I ask her if she's all right. She grimaces, she's "OK." I have a huge fat, short, pink cigarette and I want to smoke, it but I can barely fit it in my mouth. I borrow a wooden match from Sonja. I light it and puff frantically. She helps me by putting lots of matches in the cigarette end to try to catch them all on fire.
