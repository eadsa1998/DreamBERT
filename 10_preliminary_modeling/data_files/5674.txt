I am walking over some difficult terrain, up a hill, over rocks etc. There are always 2 ways to deal. Jesus is there pulling me, assisting me with the difficult way and the devil is there too, guiding me toward a much easier, pleasanter route; fields of flowers and cool breezes, paved paths and so forth. The odd thing is, both Jesus and the devil look alike in the dream. Their faces are both smooth, unlined, clean shaven, like a baby's cheeks. They sometimes are pulling in opposite directions but there is no hostility or violence. I would always wake up just as I noticed their similarity.
