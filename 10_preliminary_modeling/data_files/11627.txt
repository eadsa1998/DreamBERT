At the beginning of the dream I was riding in an open cockpit airplane. The pilot was motioning to me to look down at the ground, but I was afraid to do so. This sequence was of long duration. After we had landed I ran from the plane and refused to speak to the pilot. I was told later that a plane had crashed and the pilot was signaling me to show it to me. That terminated my dream.
