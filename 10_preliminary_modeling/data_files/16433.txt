I was back at Westport High School again -- I can't get away from dreaming about Westport High School and other schools I've been to [laugh]. But anyway, it was either -- I think it was a cross between Westport High School and Oceanside Elementary. And I was skating on roller skates through the hallway, I think because I was just there to kind of help out with something. I wasn't really there to actually go. And I can't remember too much except I was in PE class again, and we were doing jumping jacks out in the courtyard thing.
