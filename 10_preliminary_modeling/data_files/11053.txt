I was sitting in the back seat of a car when a boy I knew from my high school class got in with me. He put his arm around me and I felt that the car was moving. There were two people in the front seat whom I didn't know. The next scene seemed to be in a big kitchen. I was making something to eat for the boy. I buttered up quite a few slices of bread while I waited for him. When he came to the table, he said he didn't want anything to eat. I looked at the table and could see the yellow butter melting on the warm bread. He left and I ran after him. It seemed important to me that he should eat. I told him that I wished I had met him before I met my boyfriend, I said I couldn't leave my boyfriend and he was very disgusted with me.
