I'm in the old M City house. It's 3:30 a.m. and I see Julie B outside. She is drinking water that comes leaking out over the gutter off the front of the porch. I invite her in. We sit on the couch in the living room. I introduce her to my brother Dwight. As Julie talks about some problem she has that makes her sad, I become aware that the heavy wooden mantle of the fireplace is shaking and slowly falling. It lands in the fire and Dwight pokes it so it will burn safely in the fireplace. I get up to go look for my room. I think Dwight and Julie stay in the living room. I go to where the "Recreation Room" used to be and I think this will be a good room for my combination office/bedroom. I imagine my computer in a corner, a single bed along a wall, and an artist/draftsman table at the window to do my art work. The light will be good there and besides that's where my mother used to do her art (see drawing in dream book).
