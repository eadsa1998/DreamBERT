I am sorting papers and settling things in my new room. I put a scrub brush and other things of some height to make a foundation for a large cardboard box. I pick up a folder and think I must have forgotten it for some time when I find it in two maroon-colored three-cent stamps and I discard the bit of waxed paper in which they were wrapped but I keep a small pad of waxed paper to keep stamps in ... Then M. R. enters and starts our circle meeting. Only R and I are here. Where are the others. I see sewing supplies and think I can't help with that. M.R. tells us she will divide us in groups of four and asks us to come into the other room.
