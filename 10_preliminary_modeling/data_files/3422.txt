Derek and I arrive at a house. The meeting will start soon, maybe a dream group meeting. Some of the people are arriving. I can't get my car parked. The gate is locked and I'd have to get out and unlock it. I'm across the other lane of the road where the road curves downhill and a car is coming, so I move the car to a rocky spot. It won't fit. I turn around and someone gets in and I get out. They will park the car. Now I go in. Derek arrives and comes in. We greet each other with a kiss and quickly we are passionately kissing and want to find a place to be alone to make love. We go to several different rooms and find a bedroom. We make love. I hold his head in my hands. It is a small head. I can't see his face well. He is feeling only down to his chest. As we wriggle around he groans in pleasure with pain. I ask, "Am I hurting you?" He says, "Yes, but it is OK," as it also is the orgasm. We desperately want each other.
