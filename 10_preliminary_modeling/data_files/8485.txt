I was at family member's house. I was talking to daddy or someone else about my car. I realized that it was time for an oil change and so I made sure to get that done before I went there. I knew he would ask me and I didn't want to tell him that I was past due on it. We were talking about something else and I told him that I had fixed it myself. It was something under the hood where I had used an Allen wrench. It was a large round thing with a kind of a plate to cover the top, almost like the carburetor and the cover on the carburetor. You used an Allen wrench to take the thing off that held the cover on. We were talking about it making a little bit of a noise and that I hadn't quite fixed that. We lifted the house and I used the Allen wrench to take this thing back off to show them what I did. There was also a silver metal piece that was maybe 3-4 inches long and an inch or less wide. It wasn't all flat. Maybe a quarter inch of it was flat, then there was a slight bend and then the other end of it also had a slight bend in the other direction for about an inch of it. Somehow the one end of it had a hole in it that fit over the bolt or whatever. The other end slipped under this thing. The cover went on top. They thought that maybe I had put that piece in wrong, or in the wrong place. He agreed that I had done it right so I put it all back together, used the Allen wrench to tighten in back up. As I tightened it up, it kind of pulled something up, like it was supposed to. I started the car and it was still making a noise so I loosened it a little bit. As I did the sound stopped. It was a case where it had to be tight but not too tight. If it were too loose it would make a noise and if it were too tight it would make noise.
