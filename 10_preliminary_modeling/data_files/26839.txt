 I'm at Washington University inside a building. There is a man captive inside. I'm holding a brown book as if it is a gun, pointing it at the man. Other people are there. I'm outside the building then. I'm fighting a group of men that includes my grade school classmates Gino Teavor, Patrick Bergman, and Jerry Kasper. I'm greatly outnumbered. We fight. I'm quick, and I land many punches with my left hand. They are quick, sharp blows but they seem to have relatively little impact. It's winter, there is snow and ice covering the ground. There is an older man there. He has large (ten inch) cubes and chunks of explosive material that I know to be fire bombs. When dropped on the ground these explode within five to ten seconds. This is enough time for me to get away from them. I run away from several bombs that are thrown at or dropped near me. I slide on patches of ice, on my stomach. There are nuns there who comment on the trees surrounding us. The nuns say there are too many trees. I disagree with them, expressing my fondness for the trees.
