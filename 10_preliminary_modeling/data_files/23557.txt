I'm in a grocery store and I find a love note in a basket of strawberries. I'm in another big city, not my own town. The note was from some random guy to some random woman. I get on the freeway and I'm driving next to a really really long garbage truck. I looked in the back of it and it was like a long tunnel of garbage.
