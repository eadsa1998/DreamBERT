["A continuation of the 'world blows up' dream."] Now Captain Picard is investigating. I am a woman crew member and he asks me to take notes and notice what the crew men feel. He interviews "Hatch" the crewman whose chest was exposed. I listen to his feelings and write them down in pink ink. The feelings are soft and loving.
