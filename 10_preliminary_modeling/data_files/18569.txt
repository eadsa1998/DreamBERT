Instead of being given a life, you were given a journey across the river to the other side. The destination was always to get to the other side. It was stupid to make any plans because the journey depended on the time of day, tides, water currents and temperature in relation to states of water: solid (ice), gaseous, (liquid), wind currents, changing shoreline and you may as well stop and gather something there. In the journey it was impossible to tell, and irrelevant to use the something or other. No hurry. No. Dora was maybe at the somewhere, not sure. Temperature water would turn into ice. Icebergs and younger something.  I was not sure what gender I belonged to. Dora was not a fancy man. She liked things simple. Watching the water turn to ice. Watching the small icebergs sink just a few inches to watch the water displacement though the journey was only to the other side with flips to, not sure, maybe tolenburg? There was no need to hurry.
