I was at a vet with Mom. There were kittens. The place caught fire and this fireman came. The kittens were near the fire and I tried to save them but the fireman sent me away because of the fumes. Mom was telling me about this trick that Santiago did with his dog, he would grab its tail and it would do something. A girl relative of his (she was about 12) tried it and the dog bit her hand.
