[1997-05-29] I was at the Pittsburgh Blind Association I think it was, and was sitting beside a man, a friend of mine who was being forced out of his job, he used to be the assistant manager there and he was just sitting there biding his time because there was no work for him to do, he was ready to retire and had been waiting for that to happen, he was on the telephone, talking to somebody, then he got off and then I was on the phone talking to somebody, was talking to him about cassette recorders and he was saying to me that the only problem with this cassette recorder is that you can only put "one resistor battery" in it, whatever that means. Then I remember that my son was supposed to come pick me up but he was out running around. Then I was on a bus, talking to this woman who was a friend of mine but who is dead, and she wasn't dead at that point, I was talking to her about nothing in particular. Then I got off the bus and was walking, holding on to the bus driver's arm with one hand, somebody else with the other and they were both going in different directions, trying to pull me in different directions and I was laughing and said to the bus driver "hey, you guys know you're pulling me in 2 different directions?" So I let go of one of them and walked with him. The next thing I knew there was a cab that I was in with a friend of mine, and we were supposed to get dropped off on the south side but he accidentally dropped us off on the north side. The driver got out and was walking with us, realized we were on the north side. The cabby apologized and we got back in the cab and the driver told us he would take us where we wanted to go.
