The first thing I recall about this dream is finding myself enclosed in a large open field of grass surrounded by trees. I walked across the field from where I was standing in the center and approached a row of trees along the border of the field. As I reached out to touch one of the trees, I realized that all of them were flat objects that only appeared to be trees. When I actually touched the one I was closest to, the whole row of fake trees fell backwards over a great precipice. As they fell away, I remember moving away from them and proceeding back through the field. I began running until I approached the trees near an opposite side of the field. When I came close to these trees I could see into the forest and could perceive solid ground beyond. Since these were real trees growing out of real ground, I stepped out of the field and began moving through the forest. I remember running through the forest swiftly, but remember nothing further about this dream.
