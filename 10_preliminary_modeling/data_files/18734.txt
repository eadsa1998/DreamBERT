The sound of the music notes was played so hot against the incandescent light bulbs that they burned. White hot and almost exploded. Sharp and unnerving the sound. Bright white the bulb. Interrogation torture. Yet soothing. It was a long path. The road to the jr. High school. I was running. All the way to the old Franks house. At the side door near the back I came upon Tim Madden from behind and we raced. We were running. I was at the back door of the room. I was at the room. A recessed drain area was filled with water. When I kicked some leaves off the drain it allowed air into the system and the water finally drained out. In a new housing development, houses were for sale. One had a blue swing set so I was sure this was just the house for us. The lady said the swing set was worth $25 and available for public use. Over the drain was a purple plate, broken in 2/3. Tim said, "You could tell they didn't want anybody to go to the dark room in that drain." At the front desk, a man would pull down typefaces for you, if you asked him and he was not too busy and if it was a typeface you both liked. The President of Brazil was a land man. He was speaking.
