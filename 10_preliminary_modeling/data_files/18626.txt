Anna was very upset and cussing a lot. She was standing outside the church downtown. Tommy Cox came by and we started talking and touching each other and I said "I have a bottle of wine," and he said, "12 St. Whole foods is closed but we can climb over/under the fence." The fence was made of bones. Filed down and sharpened into spikey points. Other security measures. We got there. I went back for my wine and saw Anna and she was very upset. She was saying FUCK a lot. She said she had to strip for the cops. She banged her head down on the piano keys. It sounded like she felt. Tommy came back and his sister offered me a vinyl mini-skirt in memory of someone. I wandered off, avoiding discussion of the skirt and walked in the back yard. A bird cage with individual tiny cages 4 x 3 x 3 inches held about 30 birds of all kinds. Some were real live birds. Some were toy birds. (plastic and synthetic toy birds. Cheap toy birds/expensive toy birds. There were dogs too, running in the back yard. Back inside our hands were finding each other and we started messing around when he had to go work in the kitchen of the restaurant. He acted like he knew how too. I was in bed with 2 girls. We were laying there when the waiter from the restaurant came and gave us free breakfast from Tommy in the kitchen. It was hard to eat laying down. I spilled my vanilla pudding onto the bed (sheet) and forgot about it till I rolled lover on it.
