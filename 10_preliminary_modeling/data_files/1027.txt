I'm with Aunt Naomi and Uncle Gus. There's a volcano going to erupt. Uncle Gus wants to go see it, but I don't. I feel scared. There are children, half grown, and several boys who have grown beards. One has a girl with him. He says, "I never knew what anything meant until I met her, and now I'm alive." We're high on a mountain peak. Uncle Gus takes us down to the flat lands. He shows us a fancy yacht he gets to drive. I look closely. I say, "Oh, isn't it on fire? Are those flames coming out of it?" Uncle Gus runs to look. My "dad" is watching the flames. Uncle Gus is sad now. Then I feel the volcano starting to erupt. I run back toward the mountain peak house, calling for my daughters to hurry. I find Dovre and Paulina, but Ellie is in the shower being stubborn, unaware of the danger. I call insistently. She comes out. We run and run. Then the "children" are climbing up a cathedral-like thing and the statues of angels and Mary break in the earthquake and fall and kill some of the children. My daughter is safe. A little boy is not. He dies. I sorrowfully pick up a little angel statue and cry out at the awfulness of the children dying by these statues. A jeep pulls up. 2 men are in it. One is a bearded "son" and his friend. They are drunk. I tell the friend. He doesn't want to believe the boy died. He asks, "But there were 2 groups of children, he was in the group that was safe, eh?" I sadly said, "No." The bearded man cried out in anguish and sorrow. With no child, there is no reason to live. He rails against the religious figures that killed his son.
