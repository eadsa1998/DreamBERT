My sister Lydia shows me her wound from surgery on her hip. She says, "You may not want to see it. It's pretty messy." I hesitate and then Mirabelle and I look. It is hard to look at, lots of bloody gauze bandages and so on. Then I look up at the window and see lots of drips of water coming off the top window casement. Then I see it is blood, probably from Lydia's wound. It is dripping past the bleeding heart plant hanging in the window and I comment, "How ironic, eh?" My parents are gone this evening looking for a washer and a dryer for me. Spooky things happen. I feel a bit scared. Finally they return and they say they already took the machines to E City, that's what took them so long. We'd been doing laundry all night, which is part of why the lights went out and scared us.
