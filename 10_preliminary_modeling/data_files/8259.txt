I was in a hospital and there was no one to come and see me. No one came to visit me. I kept having to get in some kind of piece of equipment. I had to lay on my left side and down in water. The nurse told me how good it would feel but it didn't. It was very uncomfortable and the water was cold. Well, not exactly cold but chilly. Lukewarm at best. I had a hard time changing positions when I wanted to. I was talking to other patients. I would go outside and sit sometimes. Later it became a big fancy house instead of a hospital. Maybe I owned it and was selling it. I had kind of become friends with one of the patients. She and her husband had decided to buy it from me. They didn't think that I would believe them that they really were going to. We were having a meal of taco salads, tostados or something like that.
