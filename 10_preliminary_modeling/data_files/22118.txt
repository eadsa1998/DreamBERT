I remember things very vaguely, but I shall try to explain them in the best possible way. It is about my studying for final exams and just the day before I had about four more pages to complete. The next day I went to the test, I went in rather nervous and worried. I don't' remember, but I was worried. I finished taking the test and went out happy. I had done alright. When at the end they gave out the grades to show them to our parents, I knew they would be glad. I had always dreamed (so to speak) of having a Pontiac GT, so the day after I had given them the grades for the exams, I went out to find out when registration for the next term would be and I had just taken a few steps when I found the car. My father told me that it was for me, and then I don't remember any more.
