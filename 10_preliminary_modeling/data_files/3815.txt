["Caveman days and I fight."] I am swimming in a huge river. On the left are high rocky cliffs. On the right is an unending expanse of water. As I swim, powerfully, I see shapes passing me underneath. One looks like a body. Others are fish. I feel afraid that something will get me from underwater. In fact, something does. A sort of reptile man monster. We fight and I kill him. Now I swim quickly toward shore. The river is changing from the broad expanse to a narrow river more shallow with rapids. I find a beach and quickly run up on land and climb up a tree with many branches. I need to sleep there at night so I try to will the branches into a more accommodating shape. I manage it. Now I notice other cavemen in the tree. I am wary, but not afraid. Now a man from modern times, an scientist doing research comes by me. He offers me a dead carcass of some animal and I build a small fire in a paper cup. I roast the meat and eat it. He talks to his colleges about me. I do not speak. They observe me. I get out of the tree the next morning and walk around. A woman scientist says to me to be careful. There are more of those reptile monsters over by the cliff and they are unreachable and dangerous. One of them comes toward me and I point to the sun and make a gesture. He doesn't understand me. I am trying to say that when the sun moves this much, then 30 minutes have passed. He finally understands. The woman is impressed that he and I are communicating in a friendly manner. They want to continue researching me but I decide I must go on and continue my journey. I dive into the water and continue my swim. Only now it is a walk down a hilly path. A male narrator is telling how I walked until I found the city and a freeway which I had never seen before. I see the city ahead of me. Perhaps New York City. It still stands after all those centuries after the nuclear war.
