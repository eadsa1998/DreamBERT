[1997-05-24] I was coming out of the subway and I met somebody, a man who knew me and he said, "come on, I'll walk with you through the subway, and somebody else came up and they said hello to each other and he said "kiss me on both cheeks, a brassa" and they kissed. I laughed and made a comment about it being strange, 2 guys kissing, and then I thought, that was funny, I shouldn't have said that because one of them is not a guy, one of them is S, a friend of mine from Delaware. The next thing I knew, I was walking with her and I said I had just come from the airport and asked her what she was doing and she said that she wasn't going home until tomorrow so I said "lets go to lunch." Then we were at this school for blind children and I thought we would just go downstairs to the snackbar and have lunch, and we decided not to do that, and I said that there was a pizza shop down the street and she said "well I saw a McDonalds down there" so we started walking and immediately we were at the McDonalds and we went in and somebody was frying doughnuts and I could hear someone saying that they were using all this grease to fry the doughnuts and you could hear them sizzling because of the cheap grease they were using, the donuts weren't good for you to eat, and then the lady said something about the food that was ready and I thought it was mine and I hadn't even ordered yet and finally I did order and that was the end of the dream.
