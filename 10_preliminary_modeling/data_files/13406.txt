We were in a classroom and Eugene's father Abraham was teaching us. I was trying to see the resemblance, but couldn't. As he was talking his mouth was pulled down. He was wearing sandals and I was checking the Morton's toe thing. He had normal feet and I was thinking 'Yay, Eugene's probably got normal feet'. Another day, his mother was teaching except her name was Ms Carniapolous or something. She was fat and mean. Mom was there and she didn't like her either. She also had normal feet.
