["Happily rejecting arrogance."] A good looking man is sort of a gym teacher at a school. A woman counselor writes up her critique of the different faculty members. She is positive in her judgments of all of them, except him. She sees him as arrogant and self-centered. I am a pretty woman faculty member who sees those faults and smiles. She is in a shower, trying to shampoo and he is naked, trying to tease her as he is in the shower also. She just smiles and ignores his antics. He would like to be sexual with her. His penis playfully touches her and she continues to ignore him. He's an OK guy but she knows he's only playing and she doesn't intend to have a relationship with him. It is all pleasant and not rejecting.
