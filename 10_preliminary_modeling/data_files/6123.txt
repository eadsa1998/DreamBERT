My father was sitting at home one day and was watching a movie. As he is a sick man and was bored, he decided to go out and experiment with all different types of drugs. He went on to the streets. He bought everything you could possibly sniff and came home with it. He was in my room with all these types of drugs and started experimenting. He tried it on my hampsters and didn't have any effect on them. From then on it was an everyday duty for him and no one could control it. But as being sick he was getting worse. He was doing more and more and finally a doctor came over to see his condition. He admitted him into the hospital and  never seen him since.
