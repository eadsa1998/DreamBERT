Imogen (BBUK) and I were best friends. We had this parent thing on and her father worked in this deli. She skipped her father and went with me. I went to this pet shop and the mice went crazy. I wanted this cute one and it had big black ears. Then I was somewhere else and there had been a war. They were calling out families and we were standing in a line. We started going in before we were called (lots of us) so only five of us were allowed. These young twins left and then it was either me and Calvin or me and Ezra. We were only allowed a laptop. There was bubblegum. Outside, there was an ad for the place where Imogen's father worked.
