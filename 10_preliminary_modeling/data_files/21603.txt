We were walking along kissing and an old couple were walking along about 500 ft. to the side of us kissing also. Marty was giving me some cakes that were leftover. I was lacing my shoes and there was a piece of paper tied with the laces I was going to school. I met the boys from White's. We had a class meeting or sort of party and had a sort of neckpiece that went over our collar shirt. We had a new home. There was a padlock on a trap door on the floor of the toilet shed. I opened it and looked it over. There was a hole in the sheet metal around it and it had a hole that drained into the main toilet hole or a pit. Mike Polka dressed in girls' clothes and he looked like a beautiful girl. The trap door was a cover on the floor.
