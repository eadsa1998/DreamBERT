Zena AND Polly have a complicated lay over and we stay in a hotel with a sunken bathtub in a modern bathroom; There is a large convention in the hotel and I remember going down steep steps that are carpeted; I step outside and see a deep green slope with a small round lake at the bottom I am aware of the beauty: BLUE SKY AND SUN Then I see Edward (my first husband) sitting on a stone square monument SINGING. I run against the wind trying to find my bicycle, but finally give up and let the wind carry me in the other direction, so that I end up in the hotel with Frank. I run water into the sunken bathtub and start to take a bath, but suddenly am on a train rolling along....
