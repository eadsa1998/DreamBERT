Two people and I went to a park at night for a meeting. I can't remember properly but we had no money or a place to stay. This nervous guy gave me a note and then walked off. It said to not turn around and that snipers were about to execute us. I saw a red dot on one of the people I was with and I said "get down!" and we ran out. I had weapons so I was shooting back at them. One of the snipers died and the other was ok. I searched the dead guy and it was like Fallout 3 and I took his stuff and then killed the other guy. I told my friend to search him.
