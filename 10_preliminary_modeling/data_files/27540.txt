I had been visiting my uncle's drug store and did not see my aunt, incidentally I haven't seen her in several years. Afterwards I came down to our drug store and shortly afterwards my uncle and aunt got off a streetcar and came to visit us. My aunt said she was very disappointed at not seeing me therefore had come down immediately. We had some sort of conversation in which she discussed her children when they were young.
