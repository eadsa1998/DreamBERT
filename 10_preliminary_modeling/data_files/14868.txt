Dad, Ezra, some others and I were on a train thing, but it was like a rollercoaster. I was facing backwards. Living On a Prayer was playing. There was more around and I think we were only allowed to hit them in a certain place which would make them sick? They all stopped. Dad also lived in this caravan thing. He made me a pasta meal. This guy like The Joker was outside and I was going to say 'if they made a movie of you...' but then remembered about 'The Lame Knight'. We were playing some game and Dad and I were on a team and Ezra and two others were on the other team. We were then off the train thing and we were hitting each other with cushions. I was with D'Argo (Farscape) and others. I was then at an old school of mine. I was waiting at the toilet and there was one with stripy toilet paper. This teacher lady recognized me and asked I was now in Year 11 and I said "no, university" and she asked if I was doing something in media and I said "no, science". The toilet was blocked and there was water on the floor. It had leaked under two rooms behind it (that's what is says, no idea what it means). I left and had to teleport. D'Argo and the others got some sickness from changing realms. It made them into a demon randomly. It also was Runescape sometimes. I had no shirt on and hid in the toilet and I asked this guy to get me a shirt. Jensen Ackles was one of the people I was with by the way. He was sick and was getting something ready and he stopped breathing. I had to use defibrillator on him. It didn't work. Darren said "so is my son" because Quincy was dead. I tried mouth to mouth and he started breathing again. We teleported again and it was Runescape. I was at a castle, on the roof. It was dark and cloudy. The King looked like Rygel (Farscape) and needed to get down from the roof. Some people were jumping and he almost fell.
