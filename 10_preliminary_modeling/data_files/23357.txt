Dr. H. was showing me one department and another of a great industrial school like Hampton or Tuskegee. We ended by attending a student's prayer meeting. Most of the pupils seemed to be mulattos, but I remember best one very black fellow who led in a long prayer. He made frequent references to points of compass, and I observed that in every such instance each hearer pointed in the direction indicated. I was surprised to see that Dr. H. imitated his neighbors, and I somewhat sheepishly followed his example. By and by the leader began to speak of some general who had just died. I have a haunting impression that it was General Hall which may have suggested the word, "hell." "Lord," said the speaker, "thou knowest where he is, perhaps in heaven" (everyone pointed upward). The fingers dropped and pointed down, and the rest was silence.
