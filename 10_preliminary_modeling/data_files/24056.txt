In the second dream I'm in a  van with everyone from the escape and they're all talking, but I don't understand anything. All the sudden we've stopped to get dinner and then all the sudden I'm at the front of the line looking at the cashier. She's a redhead with straight hair and a really hot face and straight, perfect white teeth. I look up at the menu and recognize it as Jack-in-the-Box. For some reason I'm confused and am having a hard time ordering. She notices and I look up at her and say, "I'm not having a hard time ordering because I'm high, okay," and she looks at me sexually and says, "That's okay, take your time." Now I really want to kiss this girl, so I ask her if I can talk with her privately for a sec. I'm now behind the counter off to the side and we're standing close to each other and our waists are touching. She says something like, "You know you're not going to get to make out with me right now." Then I hold her by the waist and move in and kiss her. Then she says, sounding like a porn star, "Mmmmmm, well, okay," and we start making out and then I wake up.
