The third took place on the balcony of the house where I lived over ten years ago. It was a rainy fall or winter day and I had gone out into the balcony (although I think I wasn't soaked by the rain) around six p.m. and on the pavement one could see the reflections of the houses along the narrow street, which was a dead-end street in between two others and which that afternoon had more traffic than normal and the cars skidded on the wet pavement. Suddenly, on the corner at the right side of the balcony, a car had skidded and run into another, which was parked on the street to which the dead-end street leads. The cars behind started to crash, one on top of the other. First I wanted to signal the ones who were coming from the other side of the street, but at this point it was longer than I thought, and when I saw that nobody noticed me, I chose to just enjoy the spectacle. I even called someone who was in the house -- my father, I think -- to come and see how the cars unavoidably crashed with the one in front when they could not go on. The crashes were always underneath my balcony and it excited me to see them collide. They were of several colors, though all had just one color; there weren't any two-tone cars. And the colors were very sharp, mostly red, green and yellow. The styles of the cars were like those of the forties.
