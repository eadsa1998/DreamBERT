[1997-07-04] I was visiting my sister in Stamford. She has a nice little house, not far from the beach. I walked down to the beach with Sammy and my sister and my 3 little nephews. I could smell the salt air and I could hear the ocean's waves. I could hear the seagulls as they made that mournful cry, while they're either looking for pray or whatever seagulls do. I felt the warmth of the sun on my face, on my shoulders. It felt warm, I kicked off my shoes and picked them up so that I would have them layer and began walking barefoot through the sand. I felt the warm sand between my toes and I felt happy, until I heard a firecracker. The firecracker was awfully close to me and it was very loud, my ears were ringing, I was afraid Sammy had gotten hurt. Luckily the firecracker had missed me this time, but I jumped or jerked a little bit and woke up.
