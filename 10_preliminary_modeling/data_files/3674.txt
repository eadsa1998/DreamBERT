I am with some people. The men are selfish and rude. They get ahead of me and create a wooden sidewalk to where they want to go and it blocks my access. I ask them, "What about me?" They pay no attention. Now they are pushy and hurtful. I go into a house and find a man on a bed with blood all over him. He is very badly injured. I ask him if he needs me to call 911. He can't speak because of the pain, but nods his head yes. I try to find a phone. Finally, I have had enough. Those harassing men are after me. I had been trying to be accommodating, but now I just want them away from me. I'm tired of them hurting me. I yell at them, "Get into the boat! Get into the boat!" I shove them off and then see they have taken my purse. I demand they return it, saying, "I suppose you've taken all my money and credit cards." They arrogantly toss the purse at me. I am angry.
