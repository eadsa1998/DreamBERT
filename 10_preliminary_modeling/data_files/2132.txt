I am in a new house -- cats and sparrows. A fire is burning, but it's not in the fireplace, it's in front of the fireplace. I watch the smoke coming up into the room (like the sage last night). Hasani and I move the fire back into the fireplace. I notice my jacket on the fire and pull it off, saying to Hasani, "Look! My jacket was on the fire." She frowns at me like I'm an idiot. "Oh, you put it there," I say. "Yes. It was wet," she said. I feel it and it is dry. I see a round dining table and three xmas trees, one tiny one on the mantel and two floor trees filled with xmas decorations. It is way past time to put the ornaments away and I decide to do that as I wait for Aunt Bridget to come visit. I think about asking Hasani to help but she's on her way out. I take off lots of cute fuzzy ornaments and take one out to the garbage can in the front of the garage. Bridget comes and follows me back into the house and picks up a complex ornament from the box and says, "What is it?" It has three figures sort of melted together; red color, possibly a devil figure.
