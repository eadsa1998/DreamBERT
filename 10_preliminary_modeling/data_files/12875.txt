I was at a video shop. There were kittens there. Someone had lost theirs. I was helping them gather them up, but there were so many of them. One lady wouldn't tell me the colour hers was. Then I was at 'school'. One of our teachers was Snape (Harry Potter movies). We were all sitting on the ground somewhere. I think we were choosing stuff.
