I was sitting in a restaurant when three men came in and started robbing the place. Everyone screamed and they shot one person. They lay on the floor, blood streaming out of them. I stood there and I didn't know what to do, so I started screaming and they tried to shoot me but bullets bounced off, and they were unarmed. People came and held them until the police came. Setting: In a restaurant, I forget what kind. Characters: Other people in the restaurant. The shot person was a white man. The robbers were also big white men. I don't know any of them. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared. I thought that the dream was very scary and it doesn't seem that scary until you've dreamed it.
