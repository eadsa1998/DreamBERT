["Asking dream character what he means."] I am in a large building, and I am talking to a woman who says she has her kids in a large garage adjacent to the room we are in. I am concerned and go peek in a crack in the wall to see if it is safe for them. I decide it is OK. I am leaving now. I look to my left and see a tall man. I realize I am dreaming and decide to ask him a question so I say to him, "What do you mean in this dream?" He speaks but his words are unintelligible. I ask him to repeat it. He does and again I can not understand him. Then he says something I think is "Cat Stevens." I am doubting if I heard it correctly. Then he simply disintegrates, starting with his head. So I walk on out. Now I am visiting at a mansion of a very rich man. As I come in a woman comes out and says you're in for it. I say why, is he an alcoholic? She says yes. I walk across a huge room with very high ceilings and carpet and classical pictures on the wall. I am critical of this room. If I had lots of money, I'd decorate it better. Then I notice my shoes clicking on marble flooring. We get to his room which is a wooden desk in a beautiful library, wall to wall books. This is more like it. I like this room. He cynically asks me to make love to him. I chuckle and say no thanks. He is not used to being rebuffed. I leave and go to a quiet place by a river and sit there comfortably with a camp chair and watch the water swirl gently by. He follows me there. He wants to know why I won't make love to him. I am concerned that my place look really good, since I had criticized his so much. There is a sort of muddy spot near where I am sitting. I will it to look better. I now throw bits of bread crumbs to some kind of animal (squirrel or raccoon) nearby.
