I was in my boyfriend Jeremy's house with my mother and Jeremy and having to sneak out.  I tried hiding behind a bed as his Jeremy's father entered.  I crawled out the door.  I got out of the house and hid behind a hedge.  I talked to a small kid about how he turned invisible.  He was a ghost.  He told me you had to be dead.  I said, "But I AM dead!"  He told me to try.  All in the attempt, the will.  He told me to use black vinegar.  I tried it, and started to go invisible, several times.
