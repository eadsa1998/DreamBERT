I was at a shop. A little kid held my leg and I had to drag him along. I was then with Dad and Ezra. Then I was driving with someone and they wanted to stop at Centerville cinema and it was totally different. We went in and it was really quiet. Then she was Emma Roberts. Then people were dressed as characters from Alice in Wonderland. They closed a curtain and put on a dance. Emma Roberts went up herself and she was good. She did this backwards smooth very smoothly. We left. Our car was blue. She had changed settings on something which annoyed me.
