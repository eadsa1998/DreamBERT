 I'm at a basketball game. I'm a player on the varsity squad. There is a B-squad game going on now. I leave really early and say good luck to a younger basketball player from my high school, Ryan Barnes, as I go out of the locker room. Ryan, who I think is playing in the game that is going on now, then follows me up the stairs. I sit among people and watch the game. I have a broomstick. I sit and stretch. I reprimand a younger kid who is sitting there for his foolish talk. The team that is playing is really bad.
