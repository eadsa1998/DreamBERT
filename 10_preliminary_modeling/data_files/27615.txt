I was in a very large house, one that I had never been in before. Each room that I went in was different than the one before. The furnishings were in modern style and the colors were bright (mostly green, orange, blue, red). I was amazed at the beauty of the home and the elegance of the furnishings. Suddenly the scene changed. I was at home and the mailman left a package for me. It was my watch strap which I had been waiting a long time for.
