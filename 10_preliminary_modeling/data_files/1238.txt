I decide to hike to visit Dora. I walk miles through a town by the coast. I nearly walk through someone's front yard. I ask where the road went. A sailboat store has changed ownership and is a bakery with lots of gooey donuts. I walk through the store. I notice the rooms. It used to be a house, very important to me. I feel nostalgic and look at the curtains and sigh. I think someone I loved used to live here. As I continue walking, the sky darkens. I get concerned because I don't feel safe hiking at night. I look at my watch. It is 4:35 p.m. I see a gas station with a telephone sign. I go there and ask if I can call Dora. Maybe they'll come to get me. I tell her that I've left E City and I'm now at XXX Beach. He calls but she's not home. I continue walking. It's not too much further. I must have started late today. I stop at a second phone. She's still not home. Then I realize she's probably on her way to the lst gas station. I am a little annoyed at myself. "Why didn't I stay there?" I start walking back. The sky lightens up and the time goes backwards as I retrace my steps.
