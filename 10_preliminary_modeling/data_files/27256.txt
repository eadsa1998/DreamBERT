I was all dressed in a white wedding gown about to march down the aisle. The woman fixed my train and I proceeded to march. I was very excited but very frustrated because my dress seams split on both sides just as I was half way down. I blushed and thought everyone would notice. I kept my arms at the side. I finally reached the altar but was nervous all the time because of the split seams. The ceremony was over and the reception started. The dream ended here.
