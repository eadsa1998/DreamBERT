I was visiting someone who lived in a suite of rooms in a dormitory with some other roommates.  It was early in the morning.  Since it was a men's dormitory, I was surprised to see just the arm of a female extend through a partly opened door and wave to me.  I went to the door and looked in to see who it was.  I guess it was Lucia Polletta though it really didn't look like her.  She was more round-faced.  She had just gotten out of bed, and her face was red, puffy, and wrinkled.  When I left the dorm, I was with a girl, but not the same one.  At first, she was a blonde, with a lot of hair piled on top of her head and a lot hanging down-a wig, I suppose.  It was so striking that at first I thought I liked it-but when I was about to tell her so, I wasn't so sure.  We were going like from the dorms to the university cafeteria.  Before we got there, the girl was black -- petite, with very fine features, also long hair hanging down -- straightened or naturally straight, and soft.  Very pretty.
