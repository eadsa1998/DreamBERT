A group of us -- Wes, Lisa and Beth -- were in search of Betsy, whom we thought had been kidnapped. After maneuvering, including hiding on trains, sneaking around likely "hideouts," etc., we discovered what we thought was a likely disused railway carriage. When we opened the door there was a tiger. Although it roared, and had sharp teeth and claws, it was more interested in freedom than in eating us. Once we'd let the tiger out, Betsy appeared snickering from the other side of the carriage and said, "Fooled you."
