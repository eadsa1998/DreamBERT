I am in JAPAN in a large Department store. I carry a dark red purse. I see a DOLL and put it in my purse without paying for it. The store detectives see me and challenge me. I deny that I took anything. They open my purse and find the doll without a receipt. I argue with them. They wrestle me to the floor and finally I admit that I took it; apologize.
