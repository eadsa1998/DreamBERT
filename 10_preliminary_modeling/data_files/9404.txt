At an audition for a fashion show, I just sit and not sure whether I get an audition. Somehow I get the manager's special attention. We walk together arm in arm. He is very impressed both by my intellectual capacities and my femininity. We sort of glide through the halls. Does he want to make love to me? (he is not anyone I knew)
