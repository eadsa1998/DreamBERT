I am looking at a rack of clothes and see a pretty blouse. I say, "I don't remember owning this." Then I realize it's my mother's blouse. She says, "You can have it." She looks slim and young and well dressed. Dee Dee is also there, so I put it on. It is black with little flowers on it (roses) and short-waisted. I look good. I say, "I have a tension headache," and Dee Dee places her hands on my head to massage it. It feels very good. She hurts her hand and hops around wiggling it in the air. I apologize. She says, "It's OK. I see Bob V. I say, "Hey Bob, what about the scanner?" He says, "What about it?" I say, "Can I borrow it? He says, "Sure. Let's talk about it over a drink, a tomato and a drink after work." I say, "OK." He leaves and I say to Dee Dee, "He's married." She says, "Well, last week he had an affair with Mirabelle." I decide to go to my office without my wheelchair, to walk it. I hope I have enough energy. I start down lst floor hall and remember my office is on the 4th floor. I feel strong and good and hope it lasts the whole day. I pass a flower shop and a friend says, "How do you like it after we remodeled?" I said, "It looks good," and put a flower in my hair. I pass a counter. A woman says, "You're a Jew." I say, "Think again," quite belligerent. She is mortified and embarrassed for her mistake. I lecture her and go to find the elevator. I finally find it. Two other women with their guitars are on the elevators. The doors are malfunctioning and no one else can get on. We are worried, but make it to the 4th floor. Now I am carrying one guitar case. The clasps are open and I'm trying to close them as I walk.
