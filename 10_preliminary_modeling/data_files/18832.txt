I dreamt I was with a girl that I knew last year (I lived with her at her apartment for a week last summer). I was with her in a grocery store and she was dressed rather shabby. She picked up a handful of long fluorescent light bulbs and started throwing them about the store. The manager of this store (middle-aged) grabbed her and I picked up some cans of soup from the shelf and threw them at him. People started gathering around and throwing soup cans also. <br/
