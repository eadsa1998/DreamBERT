I'm driving a bus or a very large touring car. Other than myself, the only others in my vehicle are a woman, sitting beside me, and a man in one of the back seats. We are on a highway going somewhere when the woman asks for a drink, or a chocolate bar -- something on which to "nosh." I have nothing in the vehicle, so I head off the highway into a city. I find myself in rush hour traffic while looking for a store when I can get something for the woman. I see a large (Kresge) store on a main thoroughfare and I turn off into a small side street. There is no parking space available for my vehicle, but I'm allowed to pull into a dead-end street and park well away from traffic. But I must keep the motor idling and someone must remain inside the vehicle while I leave it to make my purchases. I don't mind leaving the passengers inside the car/bus while I run into the store. But when I look in the back seat, the man is asleep. I tell the woman to waken him because I want him to "protect" her while I'm gone. Only after I wake up do I realize that the woman sitting beside me was Mary.
