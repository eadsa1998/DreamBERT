I went to see Terry D. I was sitting there trying to figure out what to say. I finally started to say something about our last session, and he interrupted me and said essentially not to say anything, that there was no point in discussing it. I asked him why. I can't remember the words that he used, but he was implying that I either couldn't understand or grasp the concept of just deciding to be happy, or that I didn't agree with it, or that I simply could not or would not do it. I quickly told him that I do understand and grasp the concept. I also agree that it is possible to do that, that a person can simply decide to be happy and then they will be happy. I had intended to also say that I believe I understand more than a lot of people just how much our thoughts can impact our reality, that our thoughts can create a reality.
