I went to school. I got given a slip by Mr Stevenson to see him and some girls at the "hotel looking hall". I was in the office and went to the hotel like room. Mom was there. These ladies were talking to me. I had a sniffly nose. Mom said she was taking me home after and I was thinking 'Ezra's not going to be happy'. Mr Haynes was there too.
