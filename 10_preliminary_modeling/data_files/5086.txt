I am swimming in a large swimming pool made of rocks cemented together, volcanic rock. It's crowded, lots of people, older women in pink suits, etc. I swim slowly and carefully, staying in the medium deep place where it's not over my head. I am aware of how out of shape I am! I slowly stretch and exercise my muscles. It feels good. When I hang on to the rocks on the side, some of them break off in my hand. They are kind of crumbly and "incompetent." I try to put them back. [BL]
