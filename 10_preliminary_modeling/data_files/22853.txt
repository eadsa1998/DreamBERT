I always wanted a job, and somehow I am working on a project with someone I know but can't remember.  It's like this:  On a great platform about 5 or 6 feet high, there are many molds about 3 or 4 feet square, made of iron.  At one end of the platform is a pole about the size of a good-sized flagpole.  It is the end of a long machine serving as a conveyor belt or something.  It looks just like the rear of a 1958 Cadillac but stretched out to about 40 feet long, with scallops and dips in the whole length of it.  The molds have scalloped edges too-sort of like a cornbread stick mold or a knife sharpener.  From a pulley atop the pole, an iron block is quickly lowered by a rope which I hold.  Each one falls into a mold and assumes that shape.  Once, I get up onto the platform to try to do something to one of the molds, but the person I am working with says my hand will look like one of the molds.  So I use a stick instead, and retreat back over the molds.  The footing is very tricky.  There are also some large black oil drums.  I'm not sure what the "Cadillac" thing is, but every once in a while one end rises way up and comes back down.  On the opposite side of the machine is a large tree, and beyond that is a little store.  You can't see the "Cadillac" from the back door of the store because of the tree.  I take someone around the tree and show them the machine.  They are amazed.  I stop once and go in to see if Jim Wheeler has come yet.  He has just got there.
