Mom and I were at the store, Service Merchandise, I think it must've been, and she was buying kitchen supplies. And then we were in the Electronics Department, and we saw this big, we saw all kinds of speakers and stuff like you see in Circuit City. [laugh] We also saw this box, this big Grand Year box that had a picture of Celine Dion, and it was a keyboard, a Celine Dion keyboard, and it was supposed to be a replica of one that she played. And Mom got it for me, and I was thinking to myself, surprising Mom by learning to play, but I was thinking how this Celine Dion keyboard was brown and it angled kind of slightly up like the mixer. And it was really strange because it had this stand-alone amplifier with an internal speaker, and I used a like speaker wire to connect it. I was sitting on the stairs with this keyboard on my lap and I connected it to this amplifier with speaker wire and I was going to play, and I was going to surprise people. And things kept happening and I never got to. I think they were going to the beach and walking along the beach and I was telling people that I was going to do it. Then I woke up. I never did get to do it.
