       There's this flamboyant woman (middleaged, lots of dark curly hair, jewellery, rather Gypsy-like but with bread) who's part of the staff who put this on, and she comes forward (she's not the emcee, but does things to draw attention to herself anyway) and offers, flamboyantly of course, to run the last bit for us. But it's all over now, it would just be one more awkward thing, we'd just like to become invisible, even the audience is ill at ease. So she comes off it, and even says, No, I guess that sounds a little patronizing, doesn't it? And she quickly trots off, mumbling something about going to the bathroom.
