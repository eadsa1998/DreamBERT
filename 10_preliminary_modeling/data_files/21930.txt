I was in the woodwork building White's. I was going to go buy something and I opened a concealed door. Then I had to crawl thru a hole to get out. I had to move a rock in the hole to get through. I twisted the skin of my hand and it broke loose. Then my hand came off. I placed it back on and twisted the skin back into place.
