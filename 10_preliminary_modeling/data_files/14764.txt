Calvin and I were hanging out. He was reading some of my dreams. I had this big board and it said "I love" and the next bit was covered by another board. They got separated and it said "Mr Nixon". I grabbed them to cover it up and he was trying to look at it then Mr Nixon walked past. There was a dream about Dmitri and I was waiting for Calvin to say something, but he didn't.
