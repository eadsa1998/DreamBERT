I was in a doctor's office with Judy and some other small child. They were restless children. The doctor was ready to operate and he said, "John, make me a little shot." I was in an old house. The facilities were like olden times. No bathroom sink or toilet in house, floors were bare or rough boards. I saw a tiger and some goats leap into the bush. Later I saw one goat down and the tiger was chewing on the goat's hind quarters and the goat lay still, then moved a little, but couldn't do anything but look at his fate.
