 My dad has died. I'm at his funeral. He is in his casket wearing a navy blue suit. He is black, his skin. On his chest are an American Flag, shiny shoes, and an Army hat. I place a blue skittle on his jacket, because it is all I have for remembrance. We all cry a lot, especially me. I hug my mom, and cry hard. Se seems surprised because I am so emotional. I tell her I love her. I tell Grandpa and Grandma Redding, who are on my right, that I love them too. I regret that I didn't tell my dad I love him more when he was alive. We join hands and sing a happier song, swaying and clapping. The Robbins family is across from us in a pew. They make me uncomfortable. I am very sad and hurt because of his death.
