 I'm with another man my age. We're in an alley-like area where there's a large dumpster, black with rust and moisture, cold. The man was in or on the dumpster and has left or lost something in it: a small red or orange item. The area seems to be a protected, industrial area. We walk from it, seemingly leaving the area, maybe when we're not supposed to leave. A siren goes off when we are leaving and we start running. I come to a large house on a small hill. I'm in or near that house or another house. Two naked gay men come out, one of whom may be the father of the man I'm with. The men are about 30-40 years old, six feet tall, and 180-200 pounds: average males, maybe a bit bigger. I'm trying to fly. I'm concerned about not being able to fly and landing hard. I put on knee and shin pads, and am looking for the best suitable spot in the house to jump: out of a window or something. I'm back with the men. There may be another person there. The man my age doesn't seem too fond of his father's behavior. The men turn, and I see them from the front, partially, whereas before I only saw them from behind. One of the men has an erection, which I notice isn't that long. These men are rather stocky.
