I dreamt I was in history.  I was sitting next to my crush Jose.  I was writing him The Letter confessing my feelings.  He was looking over my shoulder, but I didn't mind.  It was a long letter; I was at the bottom of the page.  I asked if he and our classmate Meghan were a couple or something.  I was unusually comfortable given the situation.  He made some sort of gesture about not wanting to get together, but it wasn't completely clear.
