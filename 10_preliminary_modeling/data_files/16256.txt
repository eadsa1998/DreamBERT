This guy and his 7-year-old daughter and I were going to do the sound for a play at the Performing Arts Center or some big venue like that. And so they came over to see what kind of equipment I had, and I thought they were going to look at the CD writer, the mixer, the amplifier -- stuff like that. But instead they were looking at the digital performer program and how it's set up. And so they did most of the work. They took the rig down and set it up over there in their little sound booth, which was more like a caf√©-style box seat right over the stage, which there were a few spectators in, but there was mostly us. And I made sure I sat the closest to them so I could help them should anything go wrong. And we were all supposed to kind of help each other and do it, but the guy and his 7-year-old daughter did most of it, and I did more watching the play than helping them. And I was looking, from this box seat I could see everything that was going on on the stage, and I could see out into the seats, and I was thinking how Mom and Dad would be looking up at me in the assistant sound technician seat, but I really I did more watching the play than helping them. They didn't really want me to help; they just wanted to use my equipment, so I sat there staring out into space and glancing down at the play every so often. I can't remember anything more. I think when the play went out there was a whole lot of confusion and they just ran off with my equipment, intending to take it to house, I guess. I don't know. And I just waited in that place and Mom and Dad came to get me. And then I woke up.
