I was at Nana's and watching TV with Ezra. It was different. A girl and a guy started playing Guitar Hero, the girl was really good and the guy sucked. Ezra didn't speak, but wanted the TV back. We left the room. Dad, Poppa and others were outside looking at something. Poppa did a pee. There were bees around. Nathaniel liked nurses and his shirt said 'Princess Nathaniel'. Later I was at home and I had an email from Myer for an interview and it said it was for 'Asia Pacific' and was just up the road. I had to fill out a form with weird questions like 'why do you like disabled people?' and I put 'strong mental power' and you had to write about things you loved. I told Mom and I said I didn't know whether to accept and she said I should because she would get discounts. I was colouring in a picture of Mario and Luigi. Aunt Sally asked me to drop her and a kid off at a cemetery down the road and I said "I'm going to be late for university". There was a TV show with Paul McCartney and he was the love interest of two young girls. David Lynch got some present for me, but Darren had lied to him about something and the present was something lame. He was upset.
