A puppy like mine and another puppy (tan, cuddly, and small). I pick them up because they almost get run over. Then I put them down so they can run away. A man watches. The puppies turn into cats. He picks up one, an orange stripped one. The man is warm, watching. I feel a little badly about just letting the animals go to find food and a home on their own.
