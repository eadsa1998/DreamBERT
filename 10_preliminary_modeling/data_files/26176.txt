 I'm at home. The windows are all missing corners. I wonder why they're screwed up. My friend Tom Napper explains to me that I was unhappy and always complained about flies and spoiled fruit because of the bad screens we've had. So new screens are being put on: my mom bought them. There is some cherry pie on the stove. There was a big piece that is smaller now, that I eat. My sister Heather eats some too.
