I dreamed I played a live horse in the 2nd race. I picked out two reverses in the paper and bet them with Marty. I had a bundle of money in my wallet. We were by the coke ovens in Rivertown and were killing or getting rid of the small pygmy like colored people. We thought we were rid of them. Then we saw two of them get into a big cylinder. We filled it with rocks covered them up and knew they would die in there because they couldn't get out. We walked up the cut between the coke cars and we saw one more of the colored men. Then two more, a woman and two boys. I was thinking if we let them live, they will start multiplying again. I got into a steel car that had shelves of tools that were scrapped. I picked out different tools and carried them in my hands. Some picks, hammer files and other tools I thought I could use at home.
