 I'm playing baseball. Several professional baseball players are up before me, including Matt Williams. There are several consecutive home runs hit before me. I'm up to bat. The bat is wooden. The pitcher is mean and arrogant. The throws fast, and is throwing at me. I don't swing. I step back, and he throws wildly. Though it's not a usual thing to do in this sort of game, I walk after about seven balls. The pitcher is just too wild. This enables me to get on base and avoid being hit by a pitch. There are five bases. I'm on second. My friend Tom Napper is up after me. He is a weak batter in our lineup. It will be lucky for me to make it home with him batting, unless by a fluke he bloops the ball into the outfield and it takes a bad hop or gets by a fielder. I have to make it home when he is up, or it seems I'm out. He makes contact, and there are errors in the field. I slide into the next base, where the ball is overthrown. I get up and round the bases, scoring at home. Tom rounds the bases too and scores: an inside-the-park homerun. He has driven in 13 (or 15) runs.
