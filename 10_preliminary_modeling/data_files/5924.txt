I was in a basement area of the UN Secretariat Building in NYC and looking for the office of the Postal Administration Chief, Tom Dements. Floor looked strange. When reached what I thought was his end of floor, I saw an office that looked like his with door ajar. Saw a girl, possibly his secretary, taking dictation. Looking closer, I saw she was only reading a newspaper and then I realized it was wrong office. Walking farther, I saw #330 on a room and realized this was the third sub-basement and I wanted the second. Kept looking for stairs to ascend to second. Opened a door thinking it led up, but it was a closet or small niche and contained all sorts of electrical equipment hanging on wall. Finally found the stairs at end of hall and with great relief climbed up.
