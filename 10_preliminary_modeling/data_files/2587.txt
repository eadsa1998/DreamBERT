A man is trying to seduce me. He is outside the house and crying to weasel his way in. I call 911. A woman officer comes in and asks questions. She wants to verify if I'm a federal employee. I say, "Yes, I am" but I am wondering if I'm really being accurate. She says formally, "I wish to apologize to you. It was our fault." Meanwhile this seductive guy is still in the house trying to get my attention. I resist him. A small baby girl starts to go happily toward him. He's encouraging her because then he'll have me. I try to prevent it and take the girl away. Another man is there (maybe Howard, husband type) and he takes the little girl for me.
