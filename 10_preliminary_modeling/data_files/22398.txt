I dreamed I was a the beach with my sister, sun-bathing, and next to me there was a girl whom I don't know in real life. Then we went to this girl's house and some boys came towards us and they threw water on us. And due to this I ran to my house and stayed there till my sister arrived and we went with our little cousins to the pastry shop to buy some cake.
