I am in a place where I am watching TV and the announcer is talking about a girl who has a six month old baby and doesn't want it. He says "watch this" . The girl tosses the baby from an old blue car, something like Uncle John's old Chevy only blue. Someone gets the baby, which is a girl, and it is screaming. Its mouth seems exaggerated. I assume the woman who picks up the baby is the grandmother. Next I am in an underground place and some kind of Godzilla monster is picking up people and squishing them in its hands. At one point a woman says she has some type of cancer an is giving a urine sample. The monster picks her up, makes a face at the smell of the urine, and then squishes her. The urine was in some kind of little square container attached to a surgery table. Next I am on my way out of this underground place and it gets me. I am like I am in a seizure and can't breathe or talk but I tell it I'm not going. My husband is there and I am trying to say "I'll go with you, Bob (my husband)." I keep saying no to the monster and finally my husband takes me and we are able to get out.
