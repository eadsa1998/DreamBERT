Terence comes over to me and laughs because I didn't notice the tattoo on his nose and chest. I then see it. It is quite ornate and moves even, telling some story. He kisses me and wants to make love. I say, "Not now or here. Someone will come by." He frowns. I say, "You've got your 12-year-old face on." Some people do come by. He moves away from me. We go to the basement to find the spirits. I see lots of animal statues sitting in the sand. Some move. A statue of a man on a horse (very primitive) rides by. A blue sheep moves around. I send out psychic vibes to call all that think like me. I get a few philosophers interested.
