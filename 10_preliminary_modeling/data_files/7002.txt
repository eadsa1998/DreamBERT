Trying to get bath. Filling tub with hose from the shower faucet. Water stops. Try to reach faucet. Too high. Start to climb up. See Gussie in high room and ask her to pull cord. She does. I go back and find water pouring over floor near laundry and someone trying to wash an uneven cement floor. Only about an inch of water is in tub, a tin one about 3 feet long. I can carry it.
