I was 'testing' out a job. It was some teacher/office thing. Basically, I did nothing and checked on this pile every so often for new stuff and then leave. I found it boring. This kid was called Wiley Wave, but was sometimes called Wiley Wiggins. I was about to write his address on his work. I found work of Hermione's (Harry Potter) and she had gotten 8/9. Mom drove to this fancy neighbourhood to meet a friend called Fat Tony or something. The house she went to had no furniture and there were lots of windows.
