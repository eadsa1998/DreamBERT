 I walk into the front door at home in Oak Valley. Several of my sister's black male friends are there. They are about my age. One of them asks what position I played when I played high school basketball. I tell him I played center because we had a small team. I talk to the guys about basketball. They are all basketball players. They tell me there is a tournament taking place in Wilmerton.
