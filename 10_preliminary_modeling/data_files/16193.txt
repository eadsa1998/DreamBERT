The first dream I had, I dreamt that we were going to see a movie with Maribel and some other people, and Maribel kind of let us into the theater. We got the cheap seats, like in back, but she had us move up front kind of at the last minute because nobody showed in a couple of those seats. And she gave me this magnifier thing to look at the TV through, to somehow make it bigger, but it made it a little bigger, but it was more blurrier. [laugh] And it was about the Little Mermaid and how she, it was kind of a variation of the original, and somehow I had the notion that Samuel Wright, which is the voice of Sebastian, was in a wheelchair. I don't know how I got that idea; maybe I'm psychic. And I don't remember too much about what happened in the movie. But my second dream, I dreamt that Mom was listening to different conversations with a scanner. I'm laying in bed here. And I was trying to listen in on them too, but I was kind of afraid of the thing and I didn't want to get too close to it. And then she turned it onto the FM band for some reason and it was me saying 94.1, but it was like ultra tinny and ultra bleahhh, because it was made only for voices, and here it isfull range signals. Well, that's that. Goodbye.
