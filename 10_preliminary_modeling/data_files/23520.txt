I went to Evie's old house with Carl and Jim to do some work. It turned out Evie still owned the house, the new people had moved out and Evie was selling it. Carl went back to my house to get something. He said he would run there and back instead of drive or bike. Evie was downstairs using a power saw. I didn't want to see her and wondered if she was going to come up and talk to us. I couldn't remember which room was my old room at first. Then Jim and I went into my old room. I was looking to see if any of my stuff was still there, but it wasn't. I remarked that the new people had redone an entire wall with windows and noticed differences in other windows, and a new skylight. I looked out onto the backyard and Carl√ïs old cottage. I was going to go on the roof, but Jim sat down inside to play guitar. He was smiling. I had four cats with me. I was surprised because I thought I only had three. One of them was one I had when I was a child. I was afraid they might fight with my current cat.
