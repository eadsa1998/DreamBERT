["Going to a conference."] Theodore and his lady and me are going to a conference. We are chatting and enjoying each other's company. We are in a building in the basement floor. A long hall, lots of classrooms off it. We are walking as we talk. I look into some of the classroom doors and see that toastmaster people are in there. I see a couple like Clay and Loretta but they are also like Shirley and her husband from the conference. Apparently, a conference for them is going on as well. I see Lois in the hall and we walk along chatting. I see that lunch is being set up in the cafeteria. I go in and also see a bookstore in the same area. I decide to look in the bookstore until lunch is ready. I walk up and down the aisles looking at the merchandize. Staple boxes, and stuff.
