I was in a high school.  On my way to class I saw Kathy Reynault at a table in the hall.  I don't know what she was doing there, but she was talking to several people who were in front of the table.  I went behind it to talk to her, and casually and unobtrusively put my hand on hers, fully expecting her to pull it away.  To my surprise, however, instead of pulling it away, she squeezed it.  I was thrilled to death.  And then she whispered to me to stop by after class, that she had some good news for me.  I felt sure it had something to do with a change of her feelings toward me, and I was really excited.   In class, we had a substitute teacher.  Mother and my daughter Christina were in the class too.  The substitute made some preliminary remarks at the beginning of the class which led me to wonder if I wasn't in the wrong class.  After class some of the other students were talking to me, and they were all foreign students.  I concluded that it must have been a class in English as a foreign language.  One of the students was especially persistent.  He was complaining about something one of the other students had said in a speech.  I was very impatient to get away from him, because I wanted to talk to Kathy and I wasn't sure whether she might have already gone home.  But as I talked to the guy, I saw her walking toward us and I cut off our conversation rather abruptly and walked to meet her.  Just as we got close enough to begin our conversation, I woke up.
