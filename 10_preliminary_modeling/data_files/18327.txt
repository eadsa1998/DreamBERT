I was in my hometown with my mother and my wife and there was some sort of news of dogs. Well, everyone knew about it and something had happened and some dogs, or at least one dog, had grown to twice their normal size and they might be vicious and they were running around loose. People should be careful to lock their doors to keep these dogs out. Then I went outside into the back yard to start a fire in the fireplace we had out in the back. I was working on getting it started and it was pretty dark outside. This double-size dog ran up to me, followed by one other dog who was more vicious than the first one. I tried to blow on the fire to make it come up brighter so they might be frightened away, but the fire didn't burn very brightly and the big dog came up and started talking to each other, and he also restrained the smaller dog from getting vicious or attacking me. I don't recall what it was we talked about. I think it was something about why he had grown so big or something.
