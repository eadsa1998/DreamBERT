My wife Bonita and I, Norman and Sheila, and Wayne and Joyce, couples we know, and maybe others we know, were at some kind of lodge or fishing dock.  Along one side of it was a high levee, about 10 feet high, over which people were fishing, some of them nude.  Grandpa and Grandma were sitting on it at one place, or on a grassy knoll.  I argued with them about something -- maybe about the nudity -- but it wasn't a vehement argument.
