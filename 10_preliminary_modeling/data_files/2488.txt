There is this black man in the jungle and I am sort of him. He's a lucky man. Nobody has much of anything, but he's managed to charm a wild horse into being his so he can ride. He lies sleeping on the ground one night and a huge snake comes up and stares at him. The man/me wakes up and feels fear and then a resignation. This is a big, powerful snake and it already has the drop on him. There is no way can he fight or run, so he smiles at the snake and waits for his death. The snake is pleased with his bravery and befriends him. So wherever the man goes, so goes the snake. People can hear it slithering through the grasses as the man rides his horse. Now the man, horse and snake cross a river to visit a hut there; a beautiful young woman lives there. They chat and then the man rides away to visit a white friend who does research. Now I leave the man, horse and snake outside the wooden house and walk in to visit. This white man is also very lucky. Most people don't even have a house. He's got a bedroom, a refrigerator and he opens it up to show me he even has lots of packages of frozen pineapples, a rare and healthy treat. I now go out to find the man, horse and snake but they've gone off on some excursion. I hope they come back.
