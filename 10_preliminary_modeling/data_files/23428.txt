I was an actress in a troupe that was doing a play called the "Royal Family" that was like the one in the city now, a play about a really creative family. At first, I was in the audience but later I was acting in the play as an older woman and for some reason, knew the lines, but nobody in the play believed I did and the young lead actress said my lines out loud with me. I was the new kid in town in an ensemble which did not fully accept me but was trying very hard to make a place for me -- like a family, like an ensemble is supposed to be.
