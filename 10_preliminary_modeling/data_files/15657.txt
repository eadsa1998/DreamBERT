I was following Benjamin around. I was right behind him in a queue at one point. Then I started keeping my distance. He went into a shop and kissed this girl and I realized it was the Bulgarian girl. I started to leave and they saw me and started following me. I ran into an auditorium and went down to the floor and sat. They didn't see me. I asked a girl next to me if they had seen me and if they left and she said that they hadn't. I thought she was lying and went to move and they saw me. Then there were terrorists. They set the place up in flames and there were a few survivors. Midge Ure was the leader of the group I followed, with another guy. Another two guys were leading another group. We had to hide and a guy and I went into a lake. We went under a jetty but then saw they were looking at us. The girl had replaced a manifest and some birth certificates but they noticed straight away. Then it was like Far Cry 3 and I ended up with a gun and was taking people out. I mostly used a sniper rifle. I was at home and Mom made some pot cookies. I had some and felt weird after a while.
