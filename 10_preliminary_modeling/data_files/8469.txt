I was walking through this town. I think that I decided to get something to eat, as it was dinnertime. Something reminded me of Frisch's. I hadn't been there in many years and I recalled that they had a sandwich that I used to love so I decided to go there. But I already had a sandwich in a bag from someplace else. I ran into a woman friend that I don't know in waking life as I was coming out of a Frisch's restaurant. She insisted on buying me an ice cream sundae. They had a sundae bar. I went in to get my sundae and was standing there waiting as the workers were doing something. They had several very large square/rectangular pans with things in them that they were stirring. It seemed that they were melting toppings maybe - heating them so they were smooth and more liquid. One had lots of lumps in it, it almost looked like beans. They were all various shades of brown. One thing I picked up the ladle and let some of the contents drip out and it seemed to be creamed corn instead of an ice cream topping. I went back out to the car where my friend was waiting. I opened the car door and handed her a strawberry parfait that I had bought earlier at Dairy Queen and had not finished yet and asked her to hold it for me while I went back in and got the ice cream sundae. I didn't really want both but she was insisting that I get a sundae from Frisch's. I went back inside and now they had moved the ice cream bar down to the other end of the restaurant. I went down. Now, instead of all the large pans they simply had jars of ice cream toppings sitting in a row on the table. There were probably 10-12 of them. I decided to get half butterscotch and half hot fudge with whipped cream, nuts, and a cherry on top.
