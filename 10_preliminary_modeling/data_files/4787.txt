["Shyster."] My Grandma Maude is selling some arrogated water in bottles. She claims it has medicinal and special properties. I listen to her but don't believe it. I think she's selling regular water and making false claims. Then some man comes by with some involved theory about magnetic force. I am the teacher of a very large science class, maybe physics. The charlatan man has many of his supporters in the class to try and keep the discussion on proving his theory. I wear a long pastel colored flowing robe. I am in the back of the classroom and see some rolled up papers of his I touch them and they stick to my hand as I hurriedly try to put them back, regretting that I had touched them. He could then say I tampered with it. I rush out of there as a woman comes in there and I think she will look like she touched them instead of me. I walk to the front of the room to begin the discussion class. They pepper me with questions that are set up to lead to his conclusions. I am too smart for that and dodge the questions and redirect the discussion to normal physics and science issues I was teaching in the first place.
