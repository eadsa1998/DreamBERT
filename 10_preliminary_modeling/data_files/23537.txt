Another housecleaning dream. I dreamt I went back to Potter√ïs house to clean. The house was extremely small and cluttered. No one was there and there was a note about my money, but no money. There was a bed which I piled up with blankets and pillows and stuffed animals. The house was dark. I felt that I couldn't or wasn't doing a good job. Then there was a young woman with me. We went outside and she showed me a dog locked up behind a fence. I was supposed to take care of it. It was very active, excited. There was a neighbor who said he would let the dog out for me that night since I might not come back.
