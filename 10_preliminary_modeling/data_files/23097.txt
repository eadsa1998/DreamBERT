I was with someone with whom I shared a mutual romantic attraction-I would guess either Kathy Clarkson or my wife Bonita before we married.  We were at Grandma's house in my hometown, and were in various states of undress throughout the dream.  It was Sunday, and we were looking at the comics.  Norman was there, and I was afraid he would catch us doing something.  Grandma came in, and we had to look normal real fast.  Then it was time to go somewhere, and Daddy was there with a car., but he couldn't get it started.  I was with him when he tried.  He got angry and came back into the house.
