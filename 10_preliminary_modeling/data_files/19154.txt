I dreamed I was sitting up in bed looking out the window at a gray sky, trying to remember a dream, but I couldn't remember the dream because I didn't have a green string around my foot. All the winners had green strings around their left foot. The green string is around my foot, and it flows out of the picture. Then I'm racing over the ground; when I'm racing, I can see the green string, can see the ground moving under the green string. I'm drag racing on the motorcycle. I have a very tight feeling in my stomach. I thought I really shouldn't be doing this because my wife doesn't want me to, but she's not here.
