Now Ellie is pushing me in a manual wheelchair. We had decided not to use the power chair, too many stairs. We are going to look at an astronaut exhibit. We pass a man who has a disease and I wonder how he can stand the pain. His nurse also has the disease. We struggle to get to where we're going, but keep coming up to stairs. We see glasses all in a row and Ellie decides to buy Paulina a gift of four glasses (small, decorative drink glasses). I point out some, but they are expensive, so Ellie gets some at 50 cents each. She also buys a monkey for Paulina. We take the monkey to her and I suddenly ask a woman, "But how can we fly it to Houston, Texas? This will not work. We'll have to return the monkey." I pat it on the head like a cat. It starts to nuzzle my finger and I'm afraid it will bite me with his hard, sharp teeth. But I am surprised it only sucks on my finger like a baby, no teeth.
