I am getting info at a sort of book store about a birds meeting which was canceled but I didn't know it. I was surprised I was the last to know. Merle is there and I get on his lap and he drives around. We are dancing to a beautiful waltz. I am graceful. It is warm and touchy. Then I see my father. I get in his lap and he hugs and kisses me and strokes my hair. I feel a little uncomfortable at first, but relax and enjoy the love.
