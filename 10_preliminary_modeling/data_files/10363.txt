At a group meeting at the Book Cafe with several people including my former client. At the table nearby I see 3 men and Wally and hear Wally express some anti-Semitic attitudes. I am appalled that he has such attitudes and worry what will happen if he continues to hold those views.... Later with Marissa Camden and her daughter, I overhear her tell her how to "cut" people who are of a lower class. Again I am quite appalled by those views....
