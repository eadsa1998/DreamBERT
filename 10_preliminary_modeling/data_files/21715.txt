Ann and I were in Pick and Pays and we bought about $19 worth of groceries and we got a praise from A &amp; P employee. He said by us buying caused the company to give us a raise in wages. Then I bowled over a 200 average and I was praised on this. Then I was in a contest. I was mopping up a floor with water. This was a contest. My Uncle John won some prize by hitting some kind of contest pin when bowling. I was in a store buying a pencil and a rubber band and an undercutter for a groove in the pencil. I was going around and up on some kind of elevator. I met Bill Grove and Leroy in the store. Leroy told me of a horse and I saw it in the paper, but I can't recall the name now. I looked behind the counter in a grocery store and the floor was shredded with sugar boxes that fell and the clerks were so busy that had no time to pick them up. We seemed to have been under an attack by nuclear attack and it was over. There was a beetle or bug on Bob's clothes. It had a cover made of metal. We came to our homes and there seemed to be no damage to them. Ann said, "Take off your coat and let's do some work." I took it off and there was that beetle on my clothes. I shook him off. He fell on the floor with the other beetles. I didn't like him, so I stepped on him. Now he was as big as my foot and he was hard, couldn't crush him with my foot and weight. I looked at him. He was now bigger yet and I noticed this was a manmade shield or cover because I saw the rivets on the metal. I met John Chipka. He had his paycheck and I saw 57 hrs. time. He worked with the maintenance gang at Dill's. We went to the table to eat and he sat on the chair I use, so I took one chair away from the table. I carried it about 50 ft. and sat it down. The bug was about 20 ft. away from me. He was working his legs and I thought he would fly and come at me.
