I was working with someone. We were facing a wall that had a storage unit divided by partitions creating about 1-foot squares. In each square was a cylindrical shaped object, but not smooth cylinder, just that general shape. I think they were green, or shades of green and yellow. I have no idea what they were or how better to describe them. We were trying to put them in the right order based on their condition. Those in the best condition would go first, etc. We're now working in my flowerbeds preparing to transplant quite a few of my perennials. We were trying to figure out the new placement of each one based on how tall they get when in full bloom.
