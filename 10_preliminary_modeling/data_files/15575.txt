I was watching Community. There was a naked lady in a pool and a kid was taking photos. Then it was Abed's mother, though she was white. She said 'Charlie' was bad. Charlie was actually Jeff and he was the kid. There was a fire in this building. He went in and there was one guy in a cinema and he took himself and Jeff and put themselves into a typewriter and I wondered what had happened to the show. I was then at some big market/farm thing. Brantley asked where some stall was and I said to follow me, but I got lost and ended up in a cinema. I walked up heaps of steep steps and lost him. There was a lady right outside and I asked if Brantley had gone in and she said she thought so. A friend and I went to get desserts. Eugene was in there and I got a mudcake and 2 chocolate mousses.
