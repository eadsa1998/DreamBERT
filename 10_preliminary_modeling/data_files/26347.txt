 I see an army base. There is a civilian man, an army general, and another soldier there. They test a cannon before leaving on a flight. I watch. A fence encloses the army base. They prepare the cannon. One of the soldiers places a big blue and white plastic cooler in the corner of the fenced-in area. It seems to have some power, like a battery, but it's name starts with 'H': H____. The cannon is set on automatic. It is black, about three feet long, with a three-inch wide barrel that shoots cannon balls the size of a softball. It's a mini cannon. I sit on the barrel of the cannon, straddling it. It turns and points at my friend Kevin Simpson, who is in the corner of the fenced-in area. The cannon will fire twice. The first time it will blow Kevin's head off, and then his head will be re-sewn on. Then the cannon will fire again. I sit on the cannon as it rolls up to Kevin and the barrel presses up against his upper neck and lower chin area. I have my hand on his neck below the barrel. I know this is going to be gruesome: his head is going to be blown to pieces. I don't want to see it. I turn my head to the right and squint my eyes. I imagine the cannon firing and blowing off the fingers on my left hand. I see my hand after the shot will be fired. I see a paper printout with lines on it. The lines get shorter on the printout to reflect the missing parts of my fingers.
