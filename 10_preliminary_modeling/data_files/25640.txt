 I'm in a room with my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas, roommate Stephen Ramos, and others. The room is a dorm room on the Brimson campus. Everyone is forced to exit the room. There are amorous feelings between Annie and I. We, now including my friends Esther Thurman, Kevin Simpson, and Tony Kramer leave with others. Some people are drunk. We go through some tunnels. I lead the way. It is like the basement of the stairway in Billings Hall that isn't used much. It is also like the basement in the Green House. My clean laundry is in the Green House. I think I'll get it later. I go into a dorm. My friends Sherman Andrews and Lance Drift are there, talking about a beating or riot that went on because they were kicked out. They name several prominent Brimson people and say they are going back to get them. The building we're in is a hotel with stairs like the top floor of Social Science Hall. I go too far up the stairs, and then find the right floor. I can't find my room. My friend Darlene Miller is on the phone talking with someone about hot tub or movie plans. She is very particular. My room key says number 109. I find my room. There are many numbers on my room door, including 109. I open the door. People are having sex! I hesitate to go in, but do because I want to know whom it is. It is my old roommate Jens Nils and his girlfriend Natasha Lens. There are several of each of them, and they are having sex in different parts of the room! I pick up a chair and throw it over the bunk bed. It lands on the other side without hitting them. I rip off a ladder that is attached to the bed horizontally. Natasha sits up. She has read hair. I run the ladder at them, but they are not there: it is my imagination.
