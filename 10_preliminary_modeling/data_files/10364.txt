In a strange city lots of confusion; children playing noisily as we are about to go to a concert; I wonder if the kids should go as well and someone says "It is good for them" and they line up to go to the car where a composer friend of ours promises to take to the concert; I drive separately with a woman who is dressed in BLACK and when we arrive at the place where the concert is being held, we cant find anyone. We are LOST. Then I see the conductor come out and several people from the orchestra all dressed in tuxedos; we run down a steep incline, made up of red brick. Later I see our friend the composer who looks glum because I am told that his mother had died that nite away from home; I am sad about that. With Marissa Camden who tells me that her mother also died last nite and I say, "Then we will have to have a DOUBLE FUNERAL... sad feeling.
