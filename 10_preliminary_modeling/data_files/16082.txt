I was in my room listening to my sound system, scanning the airwaves and trying to look for a song to record. And I must have been in there for an hour in the dream, and Dad comes in and says, "Time to shut it off now." And he clothes it in a weird meaning. He says that the CD burner is a p__peeing??_ unit because it's going and recording in the same way that we go pee. I woke up at 1:30 in the morning and I was kind of scared, but I had to go pee. Maybe that's why I dreamt that.
