 I'm deer hunting with my friends Stephen and Jose Ramos. We're returning after the morning hunt, to the camper, the car, and the refrigerator. I see something white up on a hill. I'm not sure what it is. I yell at it. It is two black bear cubs. We then see a huge sow and boar black bear! Stephen runs up on the hill. The bears haven't run very far away. He shoots the large bear in the head. It falls down. Stephen falls at the same time, as if he has been shot. He is then back up, and he shoots again, and hits the bear in the head. The bear falls over, and at the same time Jose falls over as if he has been shot. When we go up to the bear we see it is whitish in color and has antlers. I haven't shot a bear yet. The sow bear is still there.
