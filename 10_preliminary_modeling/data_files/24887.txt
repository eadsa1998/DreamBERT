I don't remember what was happening in the beginning, but then all the 8th grade girls were going to one room and all the 8th grade guys were going to another room. I went out of the room, went outside at the bottom of a hill, and Julia came down too because there wasn't enough room where all the girls were. Somehow there was a round table set up out there, so we were writing on it. Then Evan called out a window, "Do you think we could bring that table up here?" I told him we could take it down, then roll it on the flat areas, but there was no way we could get it up the stairs. I don't remember what happened after that, I just know that Julia and I were having a great time. Setting: In Steve's office (head of school) and the hill off 280 going to SF that has all the graffiti on it (but there was no freeway, just the hill). Characters: All the girls and guys from my class, and Julia, one of my good friends. Evan, a guy I really hate, who's in my advisory. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, angry, annoyed. I was annoyed that Evan was bothering us. I was glad that Julia and I were having so much fun.
