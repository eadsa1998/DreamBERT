Two couples were in a bed. There was a black guy in each couple and one girl's boyfriend. This woman and some kids were naked. There was a computer with a female voice. One of the black guy's was a killer. I think we were at school. It was like a movie and everyone looked different. I was running somewhere and I walked past Eugene and Darius but they didn't look like them. There was a line of kids outside the classroom I wanted to go into and I ran past. There were cobwebs. I waited until the kids got rid of them and went into the class. Eugene and Darius had followed me in, but I left straight away and there was a spider. There was a secret group. Payton was recruiting people into the group. They left the light on and I complained that others would see. Melodie wanted a pillow so I gave her one. Samantha's sister Cyndi made a pasta dish. I told her off. This teacher guy tried to get in. We had four rooms or so and everyone was assigned a bed. Eugene and Darius decided to join. They were in the bed across from mine. I wanted Eugene to be in my bed.
