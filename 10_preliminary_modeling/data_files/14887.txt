Clayton and I were running through buildings and such in a town or a school. There was a room with grass and steps inside. There was stuff on the outside and we climbed it. Then there was like an earthquake. We held on and it was kind of fun. Then there was a little kitten which was special and could breathe fire. I was watching Dawson's Creek with Mom. Joey and some guy had been trying to have sex for ages but something always went wrong. Sometimes I was Joey. She and the guy got into a car and the guy pretended to be a taxi driver and drove them around and someone was trying to kidnap them.
