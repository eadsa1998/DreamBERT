I am visiting in my hometown. The roads are slippery and it is hard to get around. I want a donut and I find it hard to get to that street. As I am there I am coming out the door when one of the Lewis boys (neighbors) comes to the door. He is wearing an overcoat but I can see he has been cut off at the knees. I want to ask about it but decide to ask my mother instead. After he is gone we are making our way on very slippery streets to the office supply store at the newspaper where I used to work so I can buy an account book and one other item I can't remember. I ask my mother what happened to the Lewis boy and she motions for me to be quiet until we are far enough away so he can't hear us. We get to the back door in the alley and I wake up. I only hear it was something about his grandfather and he got some kind of transplant from the grandfather who is now dead.
