I got tired walking along the rough, dusty road which was slightly up hill and asked my male friend for a ride in his small car. When I got in, we discussed the road to take to our destination. We came to the room crowded with men,women and children. When we were going outside, the doctor was asked if one of the sick girls could go. He said no. There two girls, laying on cots near each other. We told them they could talk together while we're gone; but one pouted and said she wouldn't.
