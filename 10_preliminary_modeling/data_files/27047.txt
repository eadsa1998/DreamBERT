I was driving a car along 105th Street and wanted to make a stop at the intersection so that my dad and mother could get in the car. I couldn't bring it to a stop however and had to go on through a red light. When I finally stopped at the next street, 3 men were near the car. They were all strangers to me and looked about 30 years old. There was a mutual attraction between one of the men (a blonde) and myself and somehow I felt I was in love with him. He offered to drive back a street for me. My parents came up to me to drive the car back but I told them to leave us and went with him. Later, when coming up my driveway, this man's wife came out of my house and on seeing me began screaming and having hallucinations that worms were on her. Her husband and I took her to the hospital and secretly I hoped she wouldn't get well so that her husband and I could be together but I also felt terrible at thinking these thoughts.
