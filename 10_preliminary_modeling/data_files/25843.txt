 I'm with my mom, grandma and grandpa Redding, sister Ramona, and others. Grandma is having chest pains. She tries to breath but can't. She tells us this. I ask my mom if we should call 911. I do call 911. A woman operator answers. I act like I am worried or frantic, but I don't think I really am. They put grandma on the couch and elevate her feet. We're supposed to put cold compresses on her. I am not worried, for what can I do? My boss from Fishing Haven Mike Hollow is there. I talk with him about my watch. It has three hands and tells two different times. One time if for, "Like, when you're at a dance", he says. I am on the phone with a man to whom my original 911 call has been transferred. I don't' say much to the man. I walk into a room. My mom is there, with her sister who seems to be one of or a combination of my aunts Joanne, Sherry, and Nisa Redding. They take care of grandma, who is naked and on the toilet. They are cleaning her. Grandma's body is then on a table, and one of the daughters is pulling, scraping, cleaning, or cutting the flesh in her mouth with a tool. There is white stuff in grandma's mouth. I ask my mom how grandma is. Grandma looks dead. My mom is at a sink. She turns around and looks at me. I know from the look on her face that grandma is dead. My mom has bloody hands. She is holding a heart in her hands. Blood is dripping down the drain. I hug mom, and hold her. I cry. I think about my death and dying class, and if I can apply what I have learned. Blood comes from my mom's mouth as she cries. She scratches my arm as she hugs me. She is in turmoil.
