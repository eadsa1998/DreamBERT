I was on a narrow porch with my mother and sister. There was no railing. A flag pole was near the edge. It was two stories to the ground. The pole had a rope. I wanted to slide down the pole, but the height frightened me, and I was afraid of burning my palms. I thought of getting gloves. Then my sister slid down the rope. A little later we were on a very narrow part of the porch. I had to climb over my mother and sister to get past them. I nearly fell over the edge of the porch while trying to pass them. Later I was downstairs. The floor under the rug was soft in places, and I removed the rug to repair the floor and paint it. People were coming and going.
