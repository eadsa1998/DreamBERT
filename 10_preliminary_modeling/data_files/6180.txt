An old friend called on the phone. I haven't seen or talked to her in three years because we are no longer friends. She called to tell me that the rhinestone jewelry she borrowed from my mother three years ago she had dropped off at a storage place to sell. They never sold so she was calling to tell me that if I wanted them that I needed to go pick them up and pay for them because they sent her a final notice saying they were going to throw them away.
