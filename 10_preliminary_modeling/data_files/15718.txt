I was out with Ron and Hermione from Harry Potter, and someone else. There was a waterfall with water going 'in' (it was going straight down, but then there was a gap and then more water). There was also some rope going across up high and I said I dreamt I walked it. There was a fruit section and I put a fork in the bit where the prices go and ants started climbing all over it. I went 'urgh' and chucked it away and told Hermione. She said that's where the ants came from. Somehow I got her and Ron to realise they liked each other and they had this long stare and then as we walked back to the car she pecked him behind a bush. We got in the car silently. We were all sitting in the back. Another person was driving. We took off and they took their seat belts off and started making out. The person in the front saw and was shocked but didn't say anything and I tried not to laugh. Then he told them to put their seatbelt back on. Then Dad and I had a month left in the UK to do stuff. I was annoyed because I had nowhere to stay. We were walking around and I forgot my suitcases. I kept telling Dad we needed somewhere to stay and he was like 'we can just keep walking around'. We went to the Prince Charles and it was different. The Room was still showing. The place was massive and I had heard The Evil Dead was playing soon and I wondered if we'd be there for it. I went looking for my suitcase and found a plastic bag outside a flat with a power cord in it. A lady answered the door and needed to go to the hospital so we took her. She thanked us and said she'd found my suitcase and kept it for us and would let us stay with her.
