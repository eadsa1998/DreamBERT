I decide to take a relaxing bath. Nothing goes right. I put my robe on a chair and suddenly the chair has moved across the room. The water is an ugly glacier green color. The bath water is nearly overflowing. The sink falls off the wall. I'm amazed no water is springing out of the unhooked pipes! I go out into the hall to a helpful guy that likes me and I say, "Oh, quick!" He sees my face and is panicked. I quickly say, "The sink fell off the wall," so he'll relax.
