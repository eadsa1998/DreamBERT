Some high US. government official is advising me to follow suggestions made by the government in regard to burial; otherwise, I am placed in light of appearing to think myself smarter than Uncle Sam. This man asks me whether burial on Friday noon (or is it Saturday noon?), would be satisfactory. (I believe that this talk relates to arrangements for my own burial.)
