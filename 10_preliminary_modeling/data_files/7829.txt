I was at a conference similar to the old DDSI Conventions. I was a supplier. Marcia N was there and she told me that Carol [unknown in waking life] from CFC was there and had been given a new job as a Sales Executive. Shortly after that, Marcia N asked me about ordering flower arrangements. We had ordered two the year before so I ordered two again. Craig B came to say good-bye and I made some light jokes about him leaving today and it being our first day there, and some different little things.
