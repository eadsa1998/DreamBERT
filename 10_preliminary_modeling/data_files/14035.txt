I was at home. Mom and I went for a drive, but when we got back it was 7.50am, and Dad was leaving for work. I wasn't ready for school and asked Mom to take me. She said no and left. I decided to stay home and I went back to bed. Later, I saw a car in the driveway. I closed the wood door as it pulled up. It was dark outside. I ran to my room and put my school clothes on. The light was really dim in the room and something felt wrong so I did a reality check, which worked. I was then in a class with others who were lucid. I tried to put my finger through my palm [had read about it yesterday] and was saying "there is no spoon". I woke up and it said it was 25:99 and so I did another reality check, which worked and was talking to Ezra about lucid dreaming.
