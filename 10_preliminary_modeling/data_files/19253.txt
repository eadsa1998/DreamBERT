I remember it starting with me running down the street, the freeway. It was probably traffic hour because there were tons of cars with people in them just kind of sitting there. I was running away from a big red dot. It was the circle on the 7-up can. I remember being really scared, but I also thought it was somewhat funny. I saw people that I knew in those cars, from my parents, to my brothers, to my friends. I remember looking for my ex-boy friend and why he wasn't there. I stopped and hid behind a car and started talking to the person in it. I don't remember who it was. The car was somehow parked in front of the wall, so the circle started climbing the wall. I thought that the chase was all over, but then it slipped and turned around and saw me. I was so scared, but the person in the car kept smiling at me. I started to run really fast and then I woke up.
