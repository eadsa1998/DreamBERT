I was on a street in a city, with a young woman I knew, maybe waiting to catch a bus.  Another young woman, whom I didn't know, came by and asked me if I wanted to join her for a cup of coffee.  She said she wanted to talk to me about something that had several 'p's in the initials.  "Premiums" was one of the words; I'm not sure of the others, and I didn't know what she was talking about in the dream.  I invited the young woman I was with to go with us, and on the way, I kept repeating these "p" words in a singsong manner as a joke.  I had the impression that she wanted my sponsorship in some way or another.  I looked at my watch and it was 1:13.  I had a class or a bus to catch at 1:20 or 1:30, so I didn't know why I had agreed to have coffee with her.  We sat at a table in the middle of a small caf√©.  The waitress for a group in a booth next to us knocked over a bottle of something and it hit one of the people in the group on the head and spilled on the table.  The waitress didn't apologize, but the manager immediately comped the bill for the whole group, which I thought was generous but fair.
