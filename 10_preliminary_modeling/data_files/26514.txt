 I'm in a movie theatre that seems like the Deer Theatre in Oak Valley. I look in several theatres, viewing a minute or two of the beginnings of each film. I go into a theatre and I see my friend Kevin Simpson sitting in the back row. I am supposed to meet Kevin. The theatre is really empty, and there is a large white woman sitting four or five seats down from Kevin. I see him, and I say, "Hi Kevin!" He says, "Hi Kenneth." I squeeze past the woman and sit by Kevin. I tell him I've been watching the beginnings of other movies. We are seeing a Simpson's movie.
