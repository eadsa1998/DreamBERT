 I'm with my housemate Stephen Ramos and friends Niles and Tim Zelling. We seem to be camping or at a cabin. We're at a small store to get some supplies and fun stuff. Stephen and I look at large packages of water balloons: 20, 100, 500, or 1000 in a package, costing from $3 to $120. Some of the balloons are very large and are too big for water balloons, I think. An old man with a shopping cart is on a beach. I walk up and look at a newspaper in his cart. He comes over, thinking I'm stealing it. I was just showing Stephen a photograph on the front page of a man catching a trout on Lake Erie. It's the fishing opener. I say that it's a trout, but at second glance it looks like a bass. I walk out into the water with my pants on, going knee deep. I see a bunch of clams, some of which are very large. I pick one up. It looks old, having a lot of algae and growth on its shell. Its shell is large: ten inches long, and six to eight inches wide. I grab it with both hands and smack it hard against a rock. I look at it and see that the shell hasn't cracked. I flip it over and smack the other side hard. The shell still doesn't crack, but it's easy to open. I open it and rip the foot out of it and throw it down on the floor. I straighten the top of the clam muscle, to be flat, and it looks like half of a heart.
