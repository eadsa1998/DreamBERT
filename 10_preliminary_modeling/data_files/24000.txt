My best friend and I were in a blue or black truck. A faceless guy was driving. We were outside on a windy hillside road. There was no ramp on the side of the road, and instead of there being more hills or a river beneath the high road, there was nothing. It was like a cliff or a bottomless pit. I glanced through the window and saw the bottomless pit. I got scared. Then the door flung open and the guy tried to push me and my friend out of the car. He kept jabbing at us, trying to get us out. We clung onto the seat. We were screaming, begging for him not to kill us. Then we let go of the truck. We fell down, down into the clouds, and we disappeared. I had this dream two other times recently.
