I am looking for an office where I'm supposed to give a speech or presentation for VR counselors. I neglected to write the information down but I have the address memorized. Between 2nd and B I find the place I thought it was, but it is a store. I look and look, going around the corner to where the street logically should be, but I can't find it. I try and try. Now I am concerned because I didn't write down the name or phone number of the woman contact that can tell me where I need to go. I feel foolish. I remember an old office and go there, driving. I find it an old University VR office and ask a man there. He figures it out and tells me they have moved their offices from where I was. So now I go and find the group. I am late, but I cleverly use my experience and relate it in a humorous way to teach them the steps they need to take. They are amused with my cleverness and impressed.
