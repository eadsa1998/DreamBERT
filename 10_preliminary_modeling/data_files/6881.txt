I return to Hawaii and find H. and CA. are planning to be gone in November and December. I ask, "where to?" H. replies, "Oh, Europe or around the world, I haven't decided." Since you are in Hawaii I advise to go to Asia first. I say, "J. also will not be here in November and December." I think it's too bad since I had counted on spending Christmas with some of the family. Well there will be D. I can visit that day and probably friends will invite me when they know I'm alone.
