I dreamed that I was riding in an automobile with a friend of mine. We were riding out in the country where my house formerly was. We turned into our driveway and as we approached the house, another car was following us. This car was driven by an old friend of the family and with him was his sister. My Mother, at the time, was sleeping in her bedroom, as it was late at night.
