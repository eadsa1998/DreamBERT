I dreamed that my family and I went to McDonalds every meal. All my friends did too. It was like school, or something, everyone went there everyday with his or her families. The McDonalds was owned by a really sweet man, so when he one day raised the prices, I didn't mind. Soon everything was really expensive, and we stopped going there. My next dream was that someone was trying to kill me. I wasn't being chased or anything like that, but someone was trying to kill me. When I was asleep (in my dream), Lou came into my room. He started crying, and when I woke up he told me that he was the one who was trying to kill me. Then I was at the Lincoln Memorial and it was burning down. Then I woke up in real life.
