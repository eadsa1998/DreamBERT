 I'm just eaten some food from the Greasepit. I hop in my truck. My friend Kevin Simpson is driving. His truck is fixed, and the bumper is on my truck. I'm happy to see him! I ask him if he's hungry: if he wants to eat, and where. I tell him it's my treat: I'll pay. He says the Greasepit! I tell him they've lowered the price of a Bigger Burger from $1.50 back to $1.09, the previous price. I'm on a bicycle at the intersection of Main Street and Last Avenue in Oak Valley near Tom Thumb. A tall blond man is next to me. I swing my arm to hit him in the face with the back of my hand. He catches my hand in his mouth, biting it. I swing my arm away and he is thrown because he is still hanging on, biting my hand. I ride away, thinking I definitely got the better of our confrontation. I ride past Grocery Getto where, from behind, I see my third grade teacher Liza Minikel, walking. I go out to an intersection on Oak Avenue.
