I was at the Arena sitting in the audience watching an ice-show. It was dark except for a spotlight on the ice but I was able to distinguish many of my friends sitting in the audience. All of a sudden the spotlight was turned onto me and I heard the loud-speaker request me to come down and skate. As it happened I already had my skates on and I began skating alone on the ice.
