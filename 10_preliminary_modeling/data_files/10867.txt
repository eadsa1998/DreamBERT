I dreamt I was driving to a club meeting for which I am (in reality) president. I parked across the street from the house and walked in. There were many members and prospective members sitting in the living room and dining room because it was so crowded. I called the meeting to order and then most of the members got up and said they were going on the front porch where they could hear the meeting from there. I was so ashamed and insulted (because of the guests there, many whom I had personally invited) that I put my coat on, asked one of the guests if she wanted a ride home and stormed out. Only my car had disappeared. I told my friend (my age) that it was probably stolen even though I had locked it. We waited a few minutes and soon a Negro woman drove by and parked my car. Seated in the back were four little colored boys. She got out and said to me, would you please drive these boys home? I told them all to get out and asked her how she got in. She said she forced open a window. I then got in and drove away with my friend.
