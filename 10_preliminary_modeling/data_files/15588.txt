Mom was reading a newspaper and there was a picture of a guy and she said he did something bad. I was talking to Benjamin online, but sometimes it was in real life. He mentioned this 'bad' uncle of his and it turned out that it was the guy in the paper. He had gone to jail and his name was Eric. I told Mom about it. In real life, I'd written some comment like 'follow a Scottish guy around for his babies' and something about wanting flowers. Benjamin saw it and looked thoughtful (like he realised it was about him and that I liked him). I pretended not to notice. He had to leave for a bit and left me with the house keys (it was in his house?). There were keys to a locked drawer. I opened it and it just had envelopes and stuff. I closed and locked it as he came back in, but it wasn't closing properly and it stayed open a little. He said 'I don't even know why we lock that drawer' and shut it. He said something like 'my granddad might not like that you know a South Korean [if we dated]'. I was still fat and wondered why he was interested.
