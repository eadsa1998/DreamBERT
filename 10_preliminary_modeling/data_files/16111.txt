The morning when Mom and Dad are supposed to leave town. It's 5:30 this morning, so I sound a little distant. Last time I had a dream that Mrs. Dougherty was in Spanish class, and that she was going to teach us to sing "The Star Spangled Banner," which was very appropriate. And Mrs. Dougherty comes over and sits besides me, and she said that she saw me in AP Spanish, which I really am not but in my dream I was, and that I should translate "The Star Spangled Banner" into Spanish while they were doing a staff writing sheet so that I could get some AP credit. And so I started in, and I can recall that I did it perfectly. I started with the first line, "Oh say, can you see, y puedes ver" (sp??) and I was having a little trouble fitting, "by the dawn's early light, con la loof temprana de amanese (sp???)" into the melody. And I was really struggling with that. And later on there was something about Melinda driving the Mustang with somebody in it, but I don't remember for sure what that was about. One other thing about this dream that I had, when I was translating "The Star Spangled Banner" and I could hear Whitney Houston singing it in my head, I started crying a little bit because I had such sympathy for my country and all, in my dream, of course. But I still had a tear in my eye when Mrs. Dougherty came over to talk to me again, and she thought that I was disappointed because everybody else got to hear it and I didn't. [laugh] Oh, it was funny!
