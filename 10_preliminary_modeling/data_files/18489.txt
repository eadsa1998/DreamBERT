A time lapse photo would click once every 24 hours. There was a kind of plant that had circle leaf things and Dora loved them. She had put Vaseline on the seeds (so that) when the leafs grew they'd be transparent. People were lined up to buy these plants that Dora loved. A lady said to me, "You've always got your head stuck in a refrigerator." There was a cross-country skiing escape route. Signs arranging the escape route by date of birth hung high above the road. There was so much snow and slush covering the asphalt so it was tricky skiing. The guy looked at me as if to say, "You are older than 27." I made a right turn. It was time to put some gasoline in the vehicle so I skied into a gas station on the right. I had to park on a hill and lean the hose because there was no on/off switch. I got distracted and gas overflowed onto the floorboard. The gasoline smell was rampant. I pulled a sweatshirt out from under the seat and threw it down on top of the floorboard to appease the situation.
