I was watching Mumford, but it was different. He was in a shop and went up to this black guy and said hello. There was a review that said they lagged for "seven reasons". One was bad quality, another was boring. It said he didn't finish saying stuff for example, "My name -- Mumford". Sometimes it jumped around and random stuff happened. I agreed.
