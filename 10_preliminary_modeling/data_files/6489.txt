Laura sold the minivan and bought, for $6000, an inflatable Mustang hovercraft. She called it an Air Car. If you drained it of air, you could fold it up and pack it away. We went for a ride in it. She told me more about it as she stood in the kitchen, naked, intermittently drinking from a glass of water.
