 I am with my friend Nate Nelling. He asks me, "Did you hear what happened to (our old teammate) Kecker?", insinuating that Olie Kecker is in the some kind of trouble. I tell him that I have heard what happened (but now I don't remember what that is). Nate tells me that he has lost his drivers license.
