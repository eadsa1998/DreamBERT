I lived at a house with Mom near some woods. Outside we had a self-serve petrol station. It was night. I pulled in and filled up my tank. The neighbours across the road were outside in groups complaining to themselves loudly about our porch light. We turned it off and yelled out 'you could've just asked us, retards!'. Then they left their porch light on. Later, we were both in bed (we were sharing a bed) and Rover was there too. I heard a guy outside talking with a young girl (6 years old or so). I nudged Mom and told her the window was open. She didn't get up, so I finally got up and closed it. The voice was Stephen Merchant's, but it was the past, before he got famous and he was kind of insane. He was saying that he was going to let everyone know the difference between 'a condor and a girl getting raped'. Mom didn't stir and I thought that was weird. I thought about offering myself up because I wouldn't mind getting in bed with him, but then thought he might be violent/crazy etc. At one point he said he graduated here with comedy honours.
