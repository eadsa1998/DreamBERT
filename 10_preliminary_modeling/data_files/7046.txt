I was trying to work a crossword puzzle but the light was poor. I tried in one room after another to switch on lights. Told him and he said the light trouble was all over the city. By only one window could I get enough light. One word across was preacher, the definition being ecclesiastic. Second down was acted but they cross at second letter. <br/
