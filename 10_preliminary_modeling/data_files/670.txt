I am with my friend Jeannie at the school which I attended (and hated) as a child. It is wet out, like in the spring. I see a sandy place where my son has written his name. I start to write "Mom" in the sand to surprise him. I tell my friend as I am writing that my son will wonder how it got there. Then he sees me and comes over. I ask him if I can kiss him and he acts embarrassed so I don't.
