Dad and I had been staying somewhere, and living somewhere, and I somehow had the notion that it was Spain, but I didn't know for sure. I had just gotten back, and it was a week or so into school, and I was coming in, and I was walking back in the aisles in Mrs. Hollander's class, and it was real crowded, and the desks were yellow. And everyone was filled, and I got the one in the last of the back row. And Dad was telling Mrs. Hollander about what a hard time he was having teaching Spanish, and this one desk in the very back was yellow, but it was like mounted onto a table with the old Optilec (magnifying machine) on top of it. And I thought, "How weird." And Mrs. Hollander was going to start a lesson and I then I woke up.
