I'm in college, going from room to room in a large and spacious old building. I'm feeling good. The rooms are bright and neat and well kept. It's a cheerful place. I want to get rid of a large colorful towel, but a worker sees me so I carry it to the right place. Then I'm in a room with someone I know. It's well lit but somehow dark. A piece of thick paper, like a playing card, floats in the air. I show the other person how to grab it. Then he tries and with some difficulty, succeeds. Then I see something else floating in the air, but I'm waking up and it's actually the window fan in my bedroom.
