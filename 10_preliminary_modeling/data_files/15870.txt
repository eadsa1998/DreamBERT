I was at a party, lots of people were there from the Technical College. Frederick was there and was really drunk. I wasn't drinking and was sitting at a table by myself. He came over and started flirting with me, openly saying 'I'm drunk, so I'm flirty' and wouldn't leave me alone. I just kept saying 'go away, Frederick'. He kept harassing me, which was annoying but it was also funny so I started giggling at one point which spurred him on. He opened some food thing (mayo) and it got in my hair. I went to the bathroom and locked the door and went to take a shower, and he was hanging around outside still.
