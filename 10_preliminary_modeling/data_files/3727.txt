I am on a beach and I see the actor John Ritter and we talk. He says, "Remember me?" I say yes. Then we are lying down and he puts his arm over me and kisses me. Then he gently says, "I know this upsets you, so it's OK if we don't make love." I say, touched, "If I were going to do it with anyone, it would be you." He is touched. Then I say, "And I want it to be you." We kiss again and then we get up to go to his hotel room. But first he notices that the ocean has come up over a high sand dune hill and we get concerned because it could all come roaring down on us and it would be dangerous, so we begin to run back toward the hotel. We have to cross the "nuclear fields" first (a patch of unmowed pasture). As we are approaching an embankment we'll have to go up and over, it begins to rain hard. We laugh at the irony that we are fated to get wet somehow (baptism?). Water pours out through the apple trees we are under. We are concerned it will be hard to get through all the blackberry vines on the embankment, but then we see a few wooden steps and easily get up to the road. We enter the hotel. He is the manager and works there, so he comes in later than me and waits down the hall. I have two empty champagne glasses in one hand and am wet from the rain and wear a sleeveless T-shirt and look sexy and cute. I come past the desk and come to him and he smiles. I say, "Was I obvious?" He says, "Yes," laughing gently. Now we walk to his room and I suddenly remember or he reminds me that I left Charla in a room alone sleeping. I feel guilt and hope she is all right. We get in his room and for some reason he's upset and says he can't do it now. I understand but am disappointed. He sleeps on a couch with the couch pillows stacked up, but it's real uncomfortable. I am asleep on the bed. Then in his sleep, he gets up and stumbles over to the bed and before you know it, we roll over into each other's arms and make love (no sexual feelings, but contentment and comfort).
