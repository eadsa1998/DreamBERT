Mary, Maria, Adam and I are on holiday. We are going somewhere by car and are driving through the countryside. I stop the car and we get out. It seems we have lost our way. Mary is not feeling well and wants to return home. I vaguely recollect scenes where we are walking, and other scenes where we are driving. We are either lost or looking for something.
