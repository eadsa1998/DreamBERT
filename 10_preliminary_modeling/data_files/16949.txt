A news agency requires some pictures of four captured criminals who are lined up on a bench like corpses. Some have had their throats cut, but they are all still alive. For some reason I think it appropriate to 'finish the job' and I cut their heads right through, so they are just attached by the skin at the back of the neck. It then occurs to me that I might now be responsible for their murder.
