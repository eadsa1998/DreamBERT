Mrs. Dougherty and the class was over here and they were going to practice, we were going to practice in our living room and give Mom and Dad a concert. And so we were warming up in our living room, and that was neat. And we had this cake that looked like a dollhouse with all these little figures in it, and on top of it and in it and stuff. And I was sitting on the floor of my room cutting it up and putting plates of cake on the steps for everybody. And Gerard got one with a parrot and a dolphin, and Mrs. Dougherty got one with a big bear, and she said, "Make sure I get a plate with french fries." And so I piled all the french fries to hers. And then we were walking in this restaurant, from table to table holding hands and singing. And we climbed up on this one table and were singing. And my voice was louder and more resonant than anybody else's. I think I had this dream because I was practicing our songs into the amplifier yesterday, and I went into a sound field that made me sound like I was in a big bathroom.
