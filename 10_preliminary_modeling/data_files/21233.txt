I was a fugitive. I was hiding near a farm. I raised my head and looked to see if my pursuer was coming my way. He saw my head as I raised up, so he started to run for me. I ran into a field and started to climb up on a wall. He ran and jumped up, touching my feet, trying to pull me down. I was up high, about 30 or 40 ft. up and he still kept on running back and would touch my feet and try to knock me loose. The wall was like a soft clay. I dug my hands and feet into it and go up step by step. I finally got up so high he could reach me. I was afraid to fall, for it was high. He would land on his feet as he dropped down. I was a fugitive on another occasion. I fooled my pursuers and was with them, but my son Bob was hiding near and they spotted him. He ran back and forth and they couldn't catch him. Joe Bagdon had his white dairy outfit on. He tried to catch Bob, but couldn't. We were like out in the wilderness. I was driving Carter's car. I stopped on a hill and it rolled back. I put on the brake, both of them, and still it rolled back. I finally worked the pedal and pulled up the emergency brake and it stopped. I drove it into a dead end. As I was making a turn, I bumped into an old farm gate. I told Carter, "You drive your car. I might wreck it." We stopped by the house and I went into the house because I had long underwear on and that's all. I came into the house and some fur-bearing animal was rubbing against me. I reach down and it was a big black dog. I tried to push him away, but he seemed to hold my hands.
