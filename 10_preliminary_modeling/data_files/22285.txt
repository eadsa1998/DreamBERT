One afternoon around 5 o'clock I was walking down a big and long avenue. The place was rather foggy and few people were out walking. I was walking without a destination. I was rather worried that something might happen to me. Suddenly I was surprised by a German shepherd dog which was dark on top and light underneath. His attitude was aggressive. I realized it because as he saw me, he threw himself on top of me. He wasn't able to bite me because he had his mouth strapped, and I was able to subdue him. Later I noticed that a person whom I couldn't see clearly came over and took the animal. That is all I remember.
