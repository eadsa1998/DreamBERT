Mary and I were lighting religious candles together. First of all, I could not find the piece of paper upon which is written the appropriate candle lighting prayer. When I found a piece of paper, it did not contain the proper prayer. As I had never memorized that prayer, I had to improvise a prayer for lighting the religious candles. We held the match together and jointly struck it and applied the flame to the candle wicks. But the flame kept going out and we had to strike several matches before we got the candles lit. Because it was awkward for the two of us holding and striking the match together, I took it upon myself to strike the match by myself and this troubled Mary, who wanted to share in the act of holding and striking the matches together with me.
