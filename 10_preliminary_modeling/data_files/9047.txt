Yet another parish council election bad dream. I am with another member of the parish council in the front office before Mass. Peggy K was there as was Mike H. I'm standing. Peggy K and Mike H are sitting perpendicular to each other. Mike H tells me that he had not intended to make the announcement before Mass and he clearly didn't want to do it. He wasn't asking anyone else to do it nor did he say that he wouldn't do it. He put his elbows on his knees and his face in the palms of his hands, rubbing his face. I stood there and debated whether or not to offer to do it for him, though I really didn't want to do it either.
