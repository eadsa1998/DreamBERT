I was back visiting my friends at the D-- in W--. I met all the new girls I've heard about &amp; they seemed to know who I was. One of my friends was wearing two fraternity pins &amp; when I asked her why said, "One's for me &amp; one's his." Another friend of mine looked at me significantly as if to say "She's a dope." The house &amp; rooms were not the same as they are in actuality, but this did not seem to bother me in the dream. I had come somewhere with my mother &amp; it was time to leave. I did not want to take two streetcars &amp; a bus home &amp; it was snowing, etc., so I asked if they could lend me a car. The only one they had was one they said my father had purchased in Europe. It was bright yellow &amp; very strange looking. Instead of my wearing the old-fashioned goggles the car had a sort of goggles &amp; hood affair in front. Whoever it was that gave me the car said there was an over-accumulation of oil. He or she then tipped the car over &amp; the oil--a horrible looking yellow-brown fluid, poured into the mud &amp; strangled some snakes &amp; worms. On the way home there was something about a tennis court I do not remember.
