Again, this is sketchy since I'm writing it so late: All I can remember is that it takes place on a freeway. I see some guys (they seem to be Hispanics or just rowdy teenagers) in a car. They are speeding down the freeway when the car spins out of control and flips over into a ditch. I watch in horror as the car flips several times -- almost in slow motion. I can see the limbs of the occupants being crushed. Amazingly, they somehow survive the crash and begin to argue over whose fault it was. Then they run from the scene before the cops come. I see gas leaking from the car, then watch it go up in flames. Since the car has landed in a dry, grassy ditch, the fire begins to spread and I feel the whole city is going to catch fire. I somehow know chaos will break loose and there will be riots and looting.
