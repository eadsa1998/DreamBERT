 I'm with my friend Bill Hanson. Others are there. I do a sketch, a drawing in my book. It is of a face of a man with turquoise hair. I'm pleased when it is done: it's simple and descriptive. I think Bill likes it too. I say, "Why don't I throw it in the microwave for a minute?", which seems like the usual thing to do with a drawing. Bill says okay, and puts the whole sketchpad in a fake leather case and puts it in the microwave. I say, "Maybe we shouldn't put the leather in there: it may melt." He says it'll be okay, and he turns on the microwave for a minute. At the end of the minute I look over and see that the case is bubbling and curling: it's melting! A loud pop emanates from the microwave! I think it may explode, but it doesn't. I'm upset over the loss of the drawing. Bill feels guilty and apologizes to me. I tell him it's not a big deal: it's just one drawing. Then I remember that there was a drawing of the earth, sky, and sun in the sketchbook that I really liked. I am really disturbed and angry. The other drawing was inspired by the Five Suns dream. Other people are there. A German man and my friend Fiona Ulness come out of a college and sit on the grass with a blanket. They are about to have a sexual encounter.
