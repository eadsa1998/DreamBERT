Last night I dreamed that I was talking to a person who is bringing her cat over today for a visit before she leaves him with me in his new home. The dream was really similar to our last conversation in terms of arranging the time that he was to visit, but then she asked me if I had plenty of toys and I felt disappointed because she had told me previously the cat was a quiet cat and not very playful and I said 'yes I do, but I thought that you said that he's not too playful'. That's where the dream ended
