I was walking down a street when I met the 2 girls who really do live across the street from me. They are 14 and 16. They had brand new children's tricycles and were very happily riding them about. As soon as they saw me, they started to show off by standing up while riding. They were too big for the bicycles and when they stood up while riding, I kept warning them it was unsafe and they should be more careful and sit down. The 16 yr. old smiled very sweetly (which made me quite angry) and listened quietly and patiently till I stopped talking, then she and her sister went on riding as before, standing up. Then the 16 yr. old rode sitting down and I rode along on the back of her bike. We came to a place in which the sidewalk was uneven. There seemed to be a difference of only a couple of inches in the height of the 2 slabs of concrete, but when I looked down, it seemed like a canyon. I was frightened.
