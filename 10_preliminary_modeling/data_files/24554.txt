School was in session and my friends Barb and Chrissy came to visit and give me a $150 check. Then Barb told me to call her that night. When they left it was raining. Setting: School. Characters: Myself, my friends Barb and Chrissy, Ray and the other school kids in my class. Feelings and Thoughts: Sad. When I woke up, I was sad because Barb and Chrissy are my friends and they moved far away some time ago.
