A group of my girl friends and I were in W--, D-- D--. We seemed to be there for some sort of a celebration for our mothers. P-- C--, 21, and I were downtown. I left her and found myself placing a high towering building (about 4 feet square and a mile high) in a plot of cement. A-- (my other roommate--23) said it wasn't stuck in the cement far enough. All at once it started swaying. A-- rushed up the street crying "my baby, my baby." All of a sudden the structure broke in two, falling over the city and setting it on fire. I started to run to the W-- H-- to warn my mother, then I looked for a safe place to go--then I thought of P-- and wanted to warn her. I yelled "P--, P--." Then I woke up.
