 I'm fishing in the Main River in Wilmerton on the cement wall below the dam near Wilmerton University. There are several women on my right. One of the bobbers we're floating gets a hit. The fish runs, and the bobber moves on the surface. I coach the woman on my right, half demonstrating how to play the fish. I flip the bail open and let lien out until I see the black of the spool and know I'm running out of line. I flip the bail closed and set the hook; the fish is still running hard. The rod bends sharply. It's a lightweight rod that I don't want to break. The fish runs hard. I am pulled off the ledge and plunge into the water. The fish runs along a small island, in circles. I get to a point where I have taken up some line and seem to have the fish isolated in a pool in front of me.
