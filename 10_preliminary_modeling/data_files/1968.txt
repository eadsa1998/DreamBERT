I'm on some kind of tour bus, going from one place to another to accomplish tasks. One stop is the hand surgeon to look at my hands. I see a mechanical mama going up stairs. A small mechanical baby rides in her wagon (her back) a "toddler" sized wheel is attached on the back and it's going faster than the mama and has to slow down or get cramped up uncomfortably. They bounce uncomfortably up the stairs. Now I'm on a bus. We stop. I say, "Is this place accessible." I see a ramp. The bus driver thinks there are a few steps. I remember I'd been there before and decide not to go now. Josh is near the back of the bus and decides we'll all skip this stop, but four or five women get off anyway and we drive away. Josh is concerned that we will forget them and leave them. So I memorize the address, 4th and main. We go to the next stop.
