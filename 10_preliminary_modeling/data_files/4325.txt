["The king loves me."] The King of the land, who looks a lot like Al Pacino loves me deeply and desperately. He sneaks away from the upper castle to the lower bedchamber. He is my guardian so there is some forbidden sense of our love. We can not resist each other. He embraces me and we kiss passionately, hungrily. We can't get enough of each other. We try to resist, but it is impossible. He must return to the Upper Castle. I wait for his return in the bedchamber. I look out the window up at the Castle. I see windows and wonder if they can see me. I hide under the bedcovers. He returns several times and we kiss and embrace like the world is coming to an end and we hang on to each other. There aren't sexual feelings in the dream, just intense need of connection. A woman comes in to clean the room and make the bed. I must wriggle out of her way and stay hidden. I end up under the bed. Hiding.
