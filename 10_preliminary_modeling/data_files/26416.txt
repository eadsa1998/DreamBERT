 I'm at my friend Nate Nelling's house in the kitchen. I prepare a plate of food for myself that has green beans, mashed potatoes, and some kind of meat. I plan on taking my meal to the basement, where Nate and others are, it seems. Nate's father Walt is there. He has a plate of red pasta sauce. He offers me a glass of red wine, which I accept. There are three large glass jugs of wine for me to choose from, each holding about five gallons of a different kind of wine. I walk over to the jugs. I'd like a glass of lighter wine, and I pick out the lightest color of the three bottles. I see it is Elliot Hanson wine. It is not yet opened, so I don't open it, but take a different bottle that is already opened. I go over to the table, where I see there are already several glasses of wine poured, so I take one of these instead. Nate's mother comes out in a turquoise colored bathrobe to talk to Walt. She looks weak and frail.
