Something had infected people like an Invasion of the Body Snatchers kind of scenario, but I'm not sure if they were taking over the body or replicating the body. I was at Nana's, but it was sometimes school. There were lots of rooms with ensuites. My room didn't have one. Ezra had one, so I went to it as I needed to pee. I was pretending that I didn't know some of them were like that and followed them. They lead me into the middle of this place surrounded by fences. They let lions in there and there was a wooden bit on the door. I smashed it and climbed through. I ran into a closed alley. Nana looked out through a window and I told her to come and help. I discovered that they were killed easily; one was in the alley, so I threw plant pots at them and sprayed something in their eyes. I had a gun and pointed it towards them and pulled the trigger, but there were no bullets. I cracked a plant pot over their head and they shattered. Nana came down and as a test, I hit her on the arm, but nothing happened. We got in a car and locked the doors. I told her to just keep on driving.
