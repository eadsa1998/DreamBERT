I was in a booth at a restaurant, but I was in class, taking notes.  I was trying to write, when the Asian boy sitting next to me embraced me.  He wrapped his arms around my stomach, and slid them up around my chest.  I continued to write.  Then he slid me across his lap to his other side, and he wanted me to hold him instead.  I put my right arm around him compliantly, but continued to write.  The boy was wearing some sort of grey collegiate sweatshirt.  In some reference to whatever it said on the front, he said, "Let's go find our moo."  He took my hand and led me to a booth across the room.  Someone in a nearby booth claimed they wanted that booth, but it was dirty and we ignored them.  The boy said something about hiding from the school authorities.  He slid into the booth and I followed.  He had a sort of bowl-cut haircut, and wire-framed glasses. We embraced again, and kissed.  It was very gentle, kind, and sweet, but short.  It is my first kiss, and it felt magical.  I wanted another, but was awakened.
