 I'm with my friend Stephen Ramos in a school bus that he is driving. We are at Rocker High School in the parking lot. We're driving between cars, narrowly avoiding them. We turn around. We're headed for a woman in a wheelchair. Stephen turns, and we narrowly miss her and other cars. It is very close.
