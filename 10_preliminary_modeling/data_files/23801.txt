I was camping or outdoors with Risk.  It was not a secure or comfortable feeling, maybe Lynn or his friends were around, there was some anxiety.  We were talking, doing things.  There was an impression of an old shed or ruins of some buildings, old.  Then I looked at Risk's leg, where the lump was.  There was a cut all the way around the lump, like a slice.  It was bleeding.  I took Risk into the lake to wash it off.  She came in with me.  I was really worried about her.
