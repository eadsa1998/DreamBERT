I'm in a restaurant run by someone I know through work. It's a new large one that's been built in a rural setting. It has large freshly plastered white rooms and dark wooden floors and furniture. It is quite minimal. Initially, I'm there with my friend Terry. We sit down to order, we are hungry. Then people start turning up and our large empty table starts filling up. I think maybe my partner and Terry's wife turn up, and some of our other friends and their wives. Suddenly Terry coaxes me away from the table and we go outside and down the garden to the end by some bushes and trees. I can see through to fields and farmland beyond. Suddenly from behind a tree, my friend Reece appears, grinning. He's flown over from wherever to make a surprise visit to see his wife. We walk beck up the garden shielding Reece so that he can surprise her.Back at the table we sit down. Reece sneaks in and gives his wife a kiss on the cheek. We all cheer - his wife seems surprised and a little embarrassed and in fact shows signs of not appreciating the joke. In the mean time, the restaurant owner has served rice and salad, but my plate needs some meat or sauce. The owner disappears off. Reece has brought a tupperware of chilli but not enough to go around. Everyone is chatting, and ignoring their half empty plates, but I am hungry.
