My father is a police officer and one night when he was working a late shift something had happened. My father was on a call and pulled over a car. When my father walked over to the car, the driver pointed a gun and shot and killed my father. My family and I were in total shock and very upset. Now I was the man of the house, and I had to make sure things got done and had to take care of the family.
