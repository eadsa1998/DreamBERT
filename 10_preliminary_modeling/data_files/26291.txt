 I'm in a resort area. There is a swimming pool. I put clear gel sun block on my upper body and my head. Other people are there. My ex-girlfriend's father Bill Thomas is in a second story porch reading. There are several rooms in the area. I know the people that are in each room. It is a fancy resort area that I am not totally comfortable in, though it is kind of nice.
