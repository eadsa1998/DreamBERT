I keep seeing this guy around - he's pretty good-looking, seems nice, not flashy or even very outgoing, probably younger than me - we go to the same school or work in the same place, I'm not sure - I notice him a lot but I don't ever speak, we haven't actually met - and now he's sitting next to me in a movie theater. I'm with some other people but I'm pretty distracted by him. I think he's with other people too but not with a girl. I get more agitated as time goes on, and very late in the movie he turns his head towards me, leans over very slowly and kisses me. Suddenly I know he's noticed me too, and is as attracted to me as I am to him. I'm shocked, but I turn my head to him and kiss him back, on the lips. I really want him. My feelings are very strong. I don't know if anything is ever spoken, and I soon leave with my female friends; I don't know if he comes with me or not. Later I'm in an auditorium at work, with a short bank of seats with 2 aisles - the seats rise to high windows across that let in sunlight. There are 2 riser-affairs on each outside bank of seats at the front inside corners. They're for speakers to stand on, from the audience I presume, and they're just boxes of wood painted blue with a platform in the center. [The front of the room is presumably open, as a lecture hall or something, but it doesn't figure into this dream.] Some people have just left and I'm one of the last out. As I look at the riser nearest the door, I can see that it sags in the middle and looks worn. I call someone back from the door to look at it, and we agree it is pretty tacky, possibly dangerous, and we really must do something about it. ---Almost forgot, some small children were here, at least one of them stood on the riser and spoke.
