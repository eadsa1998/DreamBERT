J. and I stop at a table in the dining room with two men but R and mother go on although there are two vacancies at ours. I eat a slice of toast and a muffin with red guava jelly ... We go to our room. J. stumbles over the lamp cord. I move the lamp telling R that even if it doesn't look so well there, it must be moved so the cord will not be so in the way ... J. says he took some of his books when he moved, naming a half dozen including Tacitus. I wonder at his choice. We ought to get ours. Hunt for Miss McC and tell her we'd left books and would like the key so we could get it to pack them. She says she's so busy this week but I can get a key in p.m. I ask what time. Am walking with her to office. As we reach there she says might as well have it now and asks what my key is like. Tell her other keys will unlock my door. She produces a Yale lock key and I go back to room. The bookcases are on the opposite side of the room than where they were before. I note packages of papers. Where can I pack them? Could use bookcases but their back isn't wood and there'd by no lid. (Books are seen in color).
