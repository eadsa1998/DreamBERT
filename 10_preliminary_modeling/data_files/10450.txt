On a TRAIN trip to MEXICO: remember walking down many stairs, very carefully, feeling the cold of the steps on my feet; I am carrying a heavy bag. Also remember staying away from a party where they are telling lewd jokes. Back on the train, I see a freight train pull out of the station and a RR man standing in the caboose exposing himself. I am embarrassed but also laugh a little.....
