In this dream I was in a beer joint in Shaker Heights with the girl I go with. We were both drinking quite a few beers when all of a sudden I felt terribly ill. I went outside to vomit. She came along and was very sorry and helpful. We decided to go to another place and we were drinking liquor. I drank quite a bit. She kept saying I'd get sick, but I was determined to prove to her that I could drink more than she could. I got sick again under the same circumstances. We had quite a time and decided to go home. She wanted to go right home, but I wanted to make violent love. We had an argument about it. She said we couldn't if I was going to get sick everytime we drank beer. I felt ashamed and decided to quit drinking. She told me that wasn't necessary.
