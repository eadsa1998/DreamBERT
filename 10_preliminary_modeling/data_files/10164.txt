We are not invited to a friend's house for a get together; I feel left out; I try to clean up after another friend has made two fried eggs in my kitchen; suddenly I see a SNAKE rise up out of a SQUARE BOX holding a partly disintegrated MOUSE in its mouth; I disentangle the mouse and carry it out to the backyard and drop it in a shallow pool; I drop it in and run away.
