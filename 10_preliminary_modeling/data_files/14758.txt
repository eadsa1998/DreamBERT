I woke up and my room was different. There was a lizard on the floor. I went to call someone, but accidentally took photos of it. I got a call from Ezra and I said "you sound like a girl" and then they said "It's Tracey". It was a friend of Ezra's. I was then in the lounge room and there were a bunch of us. The lizard came and we tried to scare it away but it wouldn't go. I was squealing. Ezra was playing a game and smoking.
