I was at a magnificent ball where everybody was dressed very elaborately. The women all had on gold or silver cloth dresses. The men had tuxedos or tails on. Everybody had a banner across his chest as great diplomats wear. I was there, but I didn't seem to be dressed as the others were. I seemed to be an outsider, but no one noticed me. I had a feeling there were people of many countries there.
