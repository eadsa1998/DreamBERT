 I'm at a large picnic-like gathering outside with my dad and my siblings. There are many tables that quickly become occupied. We find and empty table. It's large and made of grate-like black metal. People start to eat. It is a help-yourself sort of meal. People go and get pieces of meat, strips of chicken or steak, and eat it. I hear there will be more than enough for all of us to eat. I see an empty table. Since we're sharing a table with others, I think of telling the family that we should move. But I don't say anything, and soon the open table is occupied. I see a large pallet of drinks: cans that are stacked up. It is help-yourself, so I go get a can. I grab a beer from the bottom. It's a long silver can. There may be soda there too.
