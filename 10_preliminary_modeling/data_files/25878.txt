 I'm watching television. The news from Lakeville is on. On the news is a man who steals things. A photograph of him is shown on the screen. I am with someone, who may be my coworker Tom from Fishing Haven. Something happens with collecting paper recyclables in Wonkers Hall at Brimson. I talk a lot, in circles.
