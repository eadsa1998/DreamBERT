A woman has hurt her foot. I must find a bucket so she can soak her foot. I go looking. I see Shane (hearing-impaired boy). Another woman asks him to help find the bucket. She doesn't realize he can't hear and gets annoyed. I take over and mouth the words carefully and repeat them. "I need to find a bucket. This is an emergency." I see a room where it had been before but it is now a restaurant. We finally find one and I take it to the hurt woman whose two feet are crippled, small and bent. I set up the bucket and she doesn't want to use it because it's painful. I encourage her to stay soaking for at least 15 minutes. It will be beneficial.
