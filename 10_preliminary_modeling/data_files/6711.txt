I am on a train, go to another car and on leaving see that my station has almost been reached. Hurry back to my seat and grab suitcase. Contents are scattered  but I have no time to pack so drop the articles into my skirt, holding it up like a bag. Among other things is my lamp. I jump off the end of the car for there is neither porter nor steps and  miss my lamp. Sure I had packed it. Think of returning after it but just then the train starts to move past me.
