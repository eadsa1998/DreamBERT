My dream took place during school, at a place in the hallway where many people meet between classes. There is this girl I know who has been flirting with my boyfriend (in real life), and that day I had gotten very mad at her for that reason. I may have been thinking about it before I fell asleep. But in my dream, Natalie is sitting on the brick bench in that part of the hall right next to my boyfriend. I'm walking up the hall and I see them. She's staring at him and talking and he's sort of flirting back. All of a sudden when I reach them, she kisses him on the cheek. I yelled something at her, and hit her across the face so hard that her head hits the cement wall behind her. My boyfriend is just sitting there with his mouth sort of open, surprised. I tell him to come with me and he goes, "But . . .okay," and reluctantly follows me away, but he's looking back at her.
