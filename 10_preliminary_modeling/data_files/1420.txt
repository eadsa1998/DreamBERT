I see the tide come in. I don't want to go to the water, but I do. Jerome swims near me. I stay near the dock so in case I tire, I have something to hold on to. Later I go across a parking lot to get to the University. Jerome follows me. He loves me. I stand in line to pay my fee. I write a check. I have trouble gathering up all my belongings. I go to my room. Jerome is waiting for me. He looks at a scrapbook and picture of my father, another of a pig-nosed man, a valentine from Jerome where I crossed out the word "kind" from "your kind teacher." He is hurt and annoyed, but pleading. He caresses my eyelids lovingly. He tells me he was upset that I would question his choices of clerk in front of Dovre who would go to his home and tell. I said, "What should I do? Close my eyes to the truth? I can't." [BL]
