I am traveling on a bus with a man from INDIA. I sit on a seat that has the arm-rest missing, but is otherwise clean and smooth riding. The man gives me some INDIAN COINS for his son and tells me to be very careful with the money; I wonder what the son will do with the money; the father doesn't seem to care. He leaves and I go to meet the son and give him the money and some advice.
