I was a patient in a hospital. My ward was being transferred. We were walking to the new ward. While I was adjusting the books and holder I was carrying and putting it in my coat pocket, the ward got out of sight, and I did not know where the new ward was located. The books bulged from my pocket. I passed a patient. (He is a patient in a ward I was in when I was confined last year. He was from India, and used to sit on the ward in the lotus position.) He was sitting in the lotus position. I handed him a paperback book with the three Magi pictured on the cover. I said that I think he would be interested in reading it.
