I was somewhere and this guy was there that looked like Andy (One Tree Hill) and I asked "are you the guy in One Tree Hill?" and he smiled and said yeah and I said "Andy?" and he said yeah. A few minutes later I asked if he had been on Lost too and he confirmed it. I was then a bad guy. I later remembered he had been in Prison Break too and lots of episodes of The Outer Limits but I didn't annoy him about it. Poppa had bought Poppers a new spa. Their house was different and in like a Mexican village. They were going to put up a second floor for him. Dad was there. We were on the balcony. I told Nana it was silly because Poppers couldn't walk up the stairs. There were chickens in cages behind me.
