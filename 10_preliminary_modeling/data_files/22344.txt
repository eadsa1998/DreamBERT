A current girlfriend of mine from the university was driving a big, luxurious red car. I had a feeling of relief and happiness, although the car was running through the highways very fast. (There was a change.) This same car was parked in front of a garage near my house (there really is a garage) and several men had raised its back part and it seemed they were trying to change the tires. The same friend and I had agreed to get married. And this made my old girlfriend cry (B., single and whom I think I love, even though it's been two years since we broke up). My mother had approved of the marriage and B., who lived near my house, furiously slammed her door when we went by. I awoke in the middle of the night with a feeling of sadness.
