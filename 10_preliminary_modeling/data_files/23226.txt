I have been spending the night somewhere-probably a hotel or motel room, and am trying to gather up all my belongings to meet some kind of deadline, possibly the departure of some kind of transportation.  I am amazed at how much stuff I have, of all kinds, and it seems that I will never get it all gathered up in time.  I think it is in this same dream, as I am leaving, that I run into Patrice Willis and Tina Mayo, who tell me that 10 or 12 students were struck by a minivan, and they don't know what their condition is.  Even though these two people are from my former university, it seems that the students were from a department at another university
