It seems that I was someone else - maybe. There were three characters, almost like cartoon characters, but we were real. We were in this big warehouse looking for costumes. We were on this trolley that went around the warehouse so you could look for your costume. There were other people on this trolley. As people found their costumes they would ride back to the front door and get off. But finally it was just the three of us and we kept going around and around and we didn't select anything. The owners were getting really upset with us. Finally, they started going really, really fast so we couldn't even see the racks anymore. We were outside walking downtown Indy.
