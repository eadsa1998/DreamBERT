I can't remember properly, but Mom was upset about her father. We went somewhere, along with Ezra. He said he was glad he knew us and I said "I'm not glad I know Ezra. Can I get him erased from my mind?" There was a movie and this girl had a guy friend who died when he was young. There was a picture of him and he had exploded? He was actually ok though.
