The things from Predator had come to Earth, but they couldn't go invisible and they didn't have the heat vision. Anyway, they would search houses for people and kill them or take them with them. They were on our street and Dad told me to hide in his cupboard underneath all these clothes. I did, but then they got to our house and they took Dad and Ezra with them. One (I think only one came in) opened the cupboard, but he didn't see me, but he somehow sensed I was in there and I got up and was running away from him. He got sick of running, I suppose, and went back to the ship but I realized he was going to blow the house up, so I ran into the shed and then I heard an explosion. The house was still standing though. The predator bloke had a look and happy with the results, he left the house and told the rest not to search the house again. Then they flew away. I was going to jump the fence to leave, but there was an evil dog. I went next door and they were in a caravan thing and they were going to leave. I knocked on the door and I said it was us (Ezra was with me now). They didn't believe us, and this guy said "What does Izzy like?" So I said "waffle, chicken" and Ezra said "guns" and they said ok and let us in. The caravan was full of people and it was really squishy inside. Granma was in there. We got to a park and there were horse races and we tried to warn everyone about the aliens but no-one believed us.
