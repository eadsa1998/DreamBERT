I was at some place and Dmitri was going out with Brianna, but she cheated on him with Carson who she'd gone out with before. Almost everyone knew, but a teacher asked Dmitri about it and Dmitri got upset but soon recovered. I was standing around later with Dmitri and I saw Daryl over somewhere and I was thinking to myself whether I liked Dmitri or Daryl more. Calvin also turned into a bird and he was in a shop with watches.
