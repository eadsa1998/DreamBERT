It is toward evening. I am getting into a station wagon. My sister, age 18, also gets in. There are 2 or 3 other people in the car but I do not recall their sex or identity. I seem to be riding in the back seat, yet later I am in the front seat. There is also a dog riding with us in the front seat. The locale in which we are riding is unfamiliar to me. After we have ridden awhile my sister and I express desire to use the women's washroom. We stop in front of a building which resembles somewhat H. Chapel. We alight and go in. We find the women's washroom. It is an immense room which resembles none I've seen. There are many little cubby holes which I presume to contain toilets. However I did not see any. Each cubby hole was covered in front with a white curtain. However the backs were left completely open. I looked through the back entrance of the cubby hole and saw a long bench on which a group of men were sitting. I looked and looked but could find no cubby hole whose back entrance was also covered. I woke up. It was about 3-4 in the morning. I felt an extreme urge to urinate.
