Julius lived where [Co-Worker-M-02 and Acquaintance-M-06 live]. He came over one day and that night Mom came over and we went under a tent with Ezra. Ezra got out and we were giggling. We got out and he walked home all serious. I heard that he hated me. But he kept coming over and something else happened but I don't remember.
