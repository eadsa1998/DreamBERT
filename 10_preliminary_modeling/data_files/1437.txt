A man comes running up to me asking if Dovre was home because he needed her keys. He was from her work. I went into the house to look. I couldn't find the keys. I shrugged my shoulders at him. Pat comes up to me, I'm sitting in my wheelchair. He hesitates. I open out my arms and invite him to sit on my lap. He smiles happily and sits. I hug him and he hugs me. It's a very nice warm camaraderie feeling. He says he didn't know I permitted this. Some kids are singing nearby. The guy who wanted the keys and two of his friends as a joke get on their knees and bow down in front of me, laughing. We were all good friends, and having fun.
