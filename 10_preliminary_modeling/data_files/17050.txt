I was in Tae Kwon Do studio explaining that I was late because I had midterms and I fell asleep. I told them about a weird recurrent dream I'd been having that had some quote about turning into women. I explained to them how all my dreams are so weird. They thought it was interesting, but weren't impressed that I missed class.
