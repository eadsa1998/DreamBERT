I am in a bathroom. Seated naked in a tub. I am spitting up bits of clothing. I am worried and fearful. What is happening? What is wrong? There are bits of things floating around in my tub. Carl comes in and Jack Nicholson. I am distressed and hardly notice I am naked in their presence. Jack N. is teasing me. He says how come you can't even come over and cuddle on the couch all night like friends? How come? He tells a slightly sexy joke. I say I don't know why you think I can't enjoy a good sexy joke. See, I can and I will come over on Thursday night and hang out with you. I am hesitant and he is impressed I am willing to do this. Then I begin to cry out for my pills. My body pills, I cry. My- and I can't think of the kind of pill I need to take. I can't remember its name. I begin to convulsively take and chew up big pills desperately. I have a mouth full of pills being chewed up. I am trying to talk with Jack N. through this all. Carl is trying to be friendly and comforting. My personal assistant is trying to help me. I am crying and whimpering, nearly crazy with my fear of not being healthy.
