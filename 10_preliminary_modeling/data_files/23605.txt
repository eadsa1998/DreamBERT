U.S.S.R. is taking over U.S.A. My house is the university. We're getting ready to move to the outskirts of the town so we can keep on the run from the Russians. The rest of my family are gone and I'm just leaving when the Russians pull up and I'm put under guard. Our house being so big, they decide to make it their headquarters. Mr. K. arrives. He is wearing a bright red coat. This is how I can tell he is Mr. K. I overpower my guard and put on his uniform. This enables me to go where I please. Mr. K. is giving a speech in a lecture hall. After his speech he walks past me and I salute him. He tells me that he is going to one of the portables to rest and that I'll be the only one knowing where he is. Big Deal. I just want to escape. Just then one of my brothers comes speeding up in a car and I jump in. We are driving along, when I think to myself, "You still have the guard's gun and you are the only person who knows where Mr. K. is." I decide I'd better go shoot him right now while I have a good chance. I tell my brother my plan and he says, "Good deal," turns the car around and we are on our way back when I wake up.
