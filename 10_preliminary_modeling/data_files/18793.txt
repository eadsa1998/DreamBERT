I was with this girl that I used to know down at the yacht club that we go to and we were sitting o the white sands of a lake in our bathing suits watching a ski show. One skier was skiing stand up. It was trick skiing. He was standing up on top of a motorcycle. He was holding the line and skiing on top of this motorcycle. When he jumped off, they had a line to the motorcycle and I thought to myself, "The motorcycle is going to sink," but the line started pulling the motorcycle in and the boat started to slow down and the motorcycle was pulled into this separate compartment in the boat as soon as the boat stopped and therefore the cycle didn't sink.
