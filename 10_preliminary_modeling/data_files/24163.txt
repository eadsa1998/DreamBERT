      When we got to his house I met this roommate (a girl) who was sitting on the stairs. She seemed very unfriendly to me. At the top of the stairs two children were playing. I remember feeling angry because they were so young. The girl in the staircase was supposed to be watching them, yet wasn't. We went to his room. When I told him I had a boyfriend I woke up.
