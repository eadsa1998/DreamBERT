I awaken from a nap and reach out to fetch my eyeglasses from a nearby table. Something is wrong with one of the lenses -- the left one. The part of the lens near the nosepiece has become very thin and has begun to peel away as if made of tranparent paper. I touch it there and more of the lens flakes away. Very soon the flaking ceases and about half of the left lens is gone, leaving a large hole in the glass. I put the glasses on my face and think to myself, "It looks like the damage has stopped. At least I can still use them." The dream ends with a feeling of making due with what I have despite setbacks.
