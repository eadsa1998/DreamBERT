I got bitten by a vampire and I got Mom in the car and then I flew to the car. Her window was broken. I saved her from the others. We went to a hospital and got Tim (Final Destination 2) and we had met him before. We kept running away from vampires. We went to some place and a vampire threw a needle at me, so I said that I was a vampire and showed him the bite. I got Mom out of there. A chemist blew up. We got out of the state and stayed at someone's house. These vampires could be in the light.
