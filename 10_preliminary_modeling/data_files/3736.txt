I am in a kitchen and notice the piled up dishes and mess. I feel bad. I haven't cleaned up for years. Howard probably is tired of that. I try to do some dishes and find a pretty cobalt blue pitcher where the handle and the spout are on the edge seams of the square corners. It's really cute. It has the words "Howard's Place" printed on it in white ink. Now I can't get the kitchen faucets to close down no matter how I turn them. I finally ask Howard how to do it. He is in the bathroom showering and I knock on the door. He calls out how. I do it. Then I go into another kitchen; more mess. I sigh. I must have not done a thing for a long time. I feel sorry for poor Howard, living in these conditions. I feel energy to clean and start in. [BL]
