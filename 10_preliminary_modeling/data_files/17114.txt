I was at my online friend Del's house.  It reminded me of the neighbor's house, with the kitchen in the middle and a step down into the living room.  There was a dog named Sog.  There were a lot of mice and hamsters.  The hamsters looked more like Puffkins, though.  The one my brother Stuart held looked like a white koala.  One looked like an owl.  Each was different.  Part of the dream I was on the computer, messaging with Del.  He explained an acronym for what he does, what I'm learning, RVCN or something similar.  He showed me something- I'm not sure of the purpose.  I was inside of him, following through the path of his reproductive system.  The feelings were mirrored simultaneously, that of an orgasm.  There was more to the dream, but I forgot, as it didn't make much sense.
