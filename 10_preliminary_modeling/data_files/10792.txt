As a project in one of my classes, I had to make some candy which I put in a tin box and then I wrapped the box in striped wrapping paper. The next moment I was at the flower show and there I saw a display of the candy boxes which my classmates and I had wrapped. My box was all covered up by the others. The others were more beautifully wrapped, so I took mine and unwrapped it in preparation to rewrap it. Then I woke up.
