Ann and I were looking for a rod for our stove in a store. She finally found in on #32 part. I wasn't a rod, but three sections of piping that clamped on the stove. I met a young, beautiful girl I knew by sight only and to my surprise, in walks Steve Bock, a fellow who worked at White's before. He had on a big old hat and a ragged coat. He walked up to the girl and she walked off with him, to my surprise. She was his girlfriend. I was out somewhere on a street waiting for Ann and he kids. I saw them stop in a station wagon about a block and a half away from me, so I played possum. I lay on the sidewalks and waited to let them find me. I finally went up to them and Shun family was with them. They had their family and children with them. I said hello to the older folk and shook hands with the children. I found myself driving down St. Clair Ave. It dawned on me I am sleeping in bed now. This is a dream and a horse by the name Night should win because it was night. The moon was shining. I looked up at the moon and it was the shape of a gorilla's head. I took a quick look and then looked again and sure enough, it was that odd shape. I drove down St. Clair. I noticed my headlights were not on, so I put them on and I drove on and noticed that the passenger service of the city was two or three boxcars coupled up were doing the service. I saw a few stop and people get off and on like a streetcar. The boxcars ran by their own power. There was no engine pushing because I looked, then I found Ann and myself on a bicycle. I was steering it. I had a horn in my hand that I used once in a while and I would let go of the handle bars. Then I lost control of it and I thought we would make a spill, but I stopped it and I looked at one of the tires. It was worn down almost to the tube, just a spot about 6" long. I saw a tube hanging out, so I pulled it out and I remembered it was an extra tube I had in it. I looked into a shanty in Rivertown looking for something.
