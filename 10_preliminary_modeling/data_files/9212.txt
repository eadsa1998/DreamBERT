I was at the SAID conference. I had spent the night with Ben D. We were getting ready for the day, the first day of conference. He had a presentation that he was getting his materials together for. Either we went to Macy F's room or she came to ours for some reason. We were chatting. We left to go to one of the main conference areas. We walked into the area where the exhibitors and products were to be set up. The room was full of many exhibitors, and only other exhibitors than what I had scheduled. I was dumbfounded, and angry. I stopped and spoke briefly with one of the exhibitors. I asked if they had rented a booth here and they said no, they were just paying a percent of sales. I asked what percentage they were paying and they said it depended on the item. Then I asked them whom they spoke to about being here and they said Loretta M. I immediately became furious. I began moving around the room and speaking with other exhibitors. They had all spoken to Loretta M, and they were all pay percentages of sales as opposed to booth rental. The amounts they were paying all varied. Ron L and a business partner had one of the booths. He had some type of expensive equipment they were showing and selling. He was being charged 45% commission. I approached Loretta M. I was so angry I could hardly speak, but trying to tell her that this was not her place to do this, and especially to do it without my knowledge.
