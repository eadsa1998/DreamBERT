I was in a theatre for a showing of some play. There weren't many people there and I thought this was because it was Wednesday. I was sitting off centre in a bad seat so I got up and moved to near the back and more in the centre. A lady came and I was sitting in her seat so I moved over one. She had this massive rocket launcher gun and she hoisted it onto her shoulder and started shooting people in the play. It shot like a fireball, but there was no fire. She said anyone who crossed this line on the floor would get shot. Everyone started running and screaming but I just stayed with her. When she went over the line to get closer, I stayed on the original side and she shot another girl who crossed it. She asked me to see this guy to call someone. He gave me his credit card (his name was Martin and he was French or something) and I had to use it at this phone booth thing. I showed the card and pointed at the guy to say it was his card and he waved back. I waited for a phone to be free and called the number. It had to be done this way so they could talk to each other in secret and the guy's baby had been kidnapped. I called the number and the 'bad guy' answered. It was his girlfriend's number, but it had been some years and you could the hear the kidnapped kid talking in the background as he was a toddler now. It was implied the bad guy had tricked the girlfriend into dating him.
