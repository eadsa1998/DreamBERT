Joe and Steve drank up my whiskey. They let two bottles of beer in the basement. Peter Arendas, Brother Steve and I were in a car. Peter was driving. We were going thru the square. We hit a lot of traffic. I watched the light and I said, "Go," and it was stop. Steve saw some pennies on the ground. He went over and picked one up, then another. He picked them so slow another guy jumped in and picked the other 3 up. Peter started to run. Steve held me back. I broke lose and ran way ahead of Pete, then I jumped up and landed on top of a building. They went in and I flew to where I thought they would come out. I saw a donkey also and his master and a boy. I went into a building and these biblica persons were playing some kind of game. They made funny signs in writing that I couldn't understand. The boy tried to work them out, but was always wrong. I wanted to put the bed light on, but it wouldn't go on. I saw a lot of shoes in front of the door. I put on the wall switch and the bed light went on.
