 I'm at a caramel corn shop in Hillston. I'm with my mom, my brother Wally, and sisters Ramona and Heather. We get a box for the popcorn. We eat a lot, then fill the box. Then we eat part of it, and fill it up. We only pay for the box, so really we're stealing. Down near the restaurant there is a huge flat heated metal surface. A shovel is used to scoop up popcorn. Then we're at Subway, in the same mall area. My mom orders a 20-inch ham and cheese sub, a six-inch M&amp;M sub, and a six-inch steak and cheese sub. The ham and cheese sub and the M&amp;M sub are kids meals. Frog meat may be included with the order. The total bill is $7.14. I think we didn't order enough food. I have a glass of water with root beer near the surface. It has a lid and a straw. I drink a lot of pink lemonade because there are free refills. There are a bunch of small containers with trinkets in them on the walls.
