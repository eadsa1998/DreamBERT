[1997-06-09] I was contacted by The Guiding Dogs via tape and letter. I was sitting at my hard maple, dining room table in my living room, reviewing my mail. I could feel the sun falling on my face and it felt warm and good. I listened to the tape on a tape recorder and it said that it was time for me to get another guide dog. I didn't want to do this because my guide dog is healthy. I contacted them in this dream and asked them why it was necessary for me to go back for another when Sammy was healthy and they just said because I needed one. I didn't want to go back. I dreamed that I went back and it was so real because they gave me this new guide dog who was huge and I'm not this tall and they told me his name and I told them that I didn't want this dog.
