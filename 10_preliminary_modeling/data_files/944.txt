I was feeling tired and my father was concerned. We were at Grandma Agnes' house. We got in the car to go somewhere. Then, for some reason, I needed to go back to the house. I got out to walk back, feeling annoyed that I'd have to walk all that distance. My father felt badly about it as well, so he walked part of the way with me along a dirt road, somewhat muddy. After I got going, I saw that I was O.K. and told my father I could make it by myself and he could go on. I went on alone. As I got near the house, a man was following me. I went in, to the enclosed front porch. He came in and talked. I suspected him. He might have tried to make advances. I felt my father's concern. Then I decided he was not going to hurt me and he went on his way.
