A couple nights ago I dreamt that I was at school in this like open air stadium thing, and the sound booth was recessed like in amongst all the seats, and somehow I had a notion that I knew the technician. Carol was with me, and we took a seat right in front of the sound booth. And it dragged on and dragged on; it was this boring thing. I couldn't figure out if it was a race or a football game. And so anyway, sitting through this boring assembly thing, I realized that I was missing the performance for the Performing Arts Center for chorus. And then I woke up.
