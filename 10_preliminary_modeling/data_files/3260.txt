I find gold stars and foil cut out ornaments on the floor and am picking them up. I am showing the girls how we are going to fold the dining table so we have more room. I fold it really narrow. The girls modify it so there is enough room at the table, but it doesn't take up so much space in the room. I look for a lace tablecloth in the closet.
