Just a few fleeting images: I'm downtown, in what seems like the hip area of the city where I now live. I am looking for a place to eat dinner. There is a Japanese restaurant, and it's serving Sapporo on tap. I like it, but I am not sure my friends will like it. It's on the corner of an open street. There is an overarching plot, but I do not remember it.
