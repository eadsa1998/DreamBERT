I'm searching high and low for something, through a house or houses. These are old, narrow, three-story houses, of the style I had lived in, as a child, on Idlewood Avenue. Suddenly, Mary appears, and rushes into my arms. "Oh, there you are!" she cries. "I'm so glad to see you! Thank Heaven you're all right!" She is very excited, agitated, or wound up. I hold her in my arms and calm her down, asking her to relax and take it easy.
