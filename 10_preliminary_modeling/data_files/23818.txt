I saw Risk, her big Dane dog body, she was sitting upright in front of me.  She slowly turned her head to look straight at me intensely, right into my eyes, and the side of her face was wrinkled up like she'd just woken up.  I felt like she'd been sleeping, like I'd woken her or disturbed her, but it was nice to see her.  I was struck by the memory of how Dane-like she could look, the particular way she moved her body and her head.  That has been missing from my thoughts of her, but now I have it back.
