Awakened by Mrs. Chal. and her grandniece as they left. I came down for breakfast and hunted thru a pile of magazines for something to read. Mrs. McC sitting by stove said how nice I looked and asked me to come nearer. She said one of the board had said they wanted the ladies to get out and have a good time and hoped I would go to a school children's exhibit on Saturday. I told her I had three engagements; church bazaar 10 to 4, Star luncheon at noon out in the country, and another. I was looking at a map of Civil War times, Confederates in gray, rest in green. But why no breakfast. Saw clock read 6:35. Wasn't it breakfast time yet? If it was an hour yet, I would return to my room. One of the ladies told me my red-patterned dress was very pretty.
