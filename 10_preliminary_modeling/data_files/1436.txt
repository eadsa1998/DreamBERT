I am sitting on a couch, watching my friends act in a skit that my daughters wrote. A 60's type bearded man is so into his part about being sad about war that he's crying as he acts. He's very good! The skit was tacky but the way he performed was excellent. As he is crying, I hear the most beautiful chord music coming from the cathedral across the street. The red stained glass windows flow. I make a small joke. I say "My friends, the angels." The music is so beautiful!
