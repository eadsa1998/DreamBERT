I handed Duke several specimens of the weird genus Listronsties for study. He seemed conscience stricken because of an unfinished piece of work that should have been completed long before. Under the circumstances, I feel it is best to suggest that Duke make no more that a brief and preliminary examination of the specimens at this time, as there should be others along later. The preliminary study seemed advisable because it would make much easier the identification of the later specimens.
