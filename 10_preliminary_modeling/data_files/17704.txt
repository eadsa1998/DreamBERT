My boyfriend Jeremy and I were walking through my parents house.  We acquired some sort of object.  It could change, and we were cycling through the various options trying to figure out what they did and which we wanted.  There was a tree branch, a snake, and something with lights; probably 8 different things altogether.  Each did something different, useful in different situations.  One was 'for Paladin only', like in Diablo, so it was like we were playing a game.  We could cycle through the objects, but I wanted to try using each of the objects to see what they were for.  Testing didn't seem to reveal anything.  Later, I discovered they only work when they need to; the carved snake became alive when we were encountered by an enemy of some sort.  Outside, the place looked like a sort of X-Men institute.  There was a group playing basketball.  One player looked like David Bowie from Labyrinth, but with longer, pink hair.  He was telekinetically rushing the ball around the court.  Play of the game was much different considering player constraints were different.
