 I'm out at night at a pub. I win two pints, two beers, and a six-pack, but am not given the six-pack. My friends Stephen Ramos, Virginia Green, Virginia's sister, and my sister Ramona are there. Virginia comes up to me when I first see her, and says something about how she always was attracted to me in high school. I'm uncomfortable and don't know now to reply. The night continues. In the morning I awaken at a place with many people, all of whom have stayed overnight. Some of the people are going to Herman or Johnsonville. I notice the faces of several people from the university in Melbourne. I see my acquaintances Wendy, Joe, and Amanda from the Backcountry Trail. That morning I'm walking with Stephen. We seem to be leaving. I ask him if Virginia was really there last night, or if it was a dream, because it left me feeling uneasy. He laughs and says it was real. I think, then, of another situation that I was in, and wonder if it was a dream. But I don't ask Stephen because I'm not sure it was.
