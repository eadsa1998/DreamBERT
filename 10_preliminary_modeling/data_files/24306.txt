I was in a house. There was competition between me and someone else over possession of something. It was reminiscent of my grandparents' house, though from decades ago, when the place was alive and verdant, with jasmine vines hanging over the water of the pond. I was trying to take a shower in private. There were friends and allies around. I wanted to keep them safe, even though they didn't know they needed protecting. Then the person came. He was familiar, like a brother, but ultimately adversarial. He was like an arch-nemesis, the kind of enemy you hate so much, you cannot kill each other. At first he is trying to get inside. I lock him out of one entrance, and sprint around the side of the house and then upstairs and outside. I run along the top of a concrete wall, then to the roof. I can tell he is coming for me, but will take some time. I get in position for when he rounds the corner. He comes around and I knock him down. He drops something, whatever it is that was being protected. I make my move and jump from the roof for it. I think, "why the hell not," and leap from the roof and escalate the conflict. My robe flutters through the air as I land near the thing. I defied gravity as I leapt so far and broadly and landed so lightly. I used the energy of my impact to leap off again, spiraling upward through the air. My enemy, clad in red and dark blue robes, came after me. He could fly too. We battled in the air, in an acrobatic display of aerial combat like the matrix or dragon ball z. There was water in much of the flooded area. I leap and grab him, and take him down hard. I wrap my arm around his neck and make sure his head hits the bottom after we plunge through the water. Without sound, he tells me: ok, you win. I know he's not really dead, but that I have simply beaten him.
