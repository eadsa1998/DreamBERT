I had gotten this dog and it was at Nana's. I went up there one day and Austin, Uncle Wilbur, some lady and Poppa were there. Mom got me a bed and Poppa was checking it. Ezra was there too. The top of the cubby house had been taken off. Nana said the dog was missing. They had little fenced off section with kittens. I picked up an orange and white one. Ezra picked up a black one. Nana and I went to this garage looking shop to look for the dog. We had to be quiet, but the guy saw us. Nana quickly said "pound of eyes please". He thought I was acting weird. He farted and walked out. Then he came and he was holding a pig (which was my 'dog') and he was going to kill it and I screamed "No!" and went after him, crying. Then it was somewhere in England. It was showing the Thames, except it was called 'Ems'. Granma was telling me how to pronounce it. This guy was driving next to it and the road was slippery and he fell into the water. There were shoes in the river and people were calling them out. This Scottish guy was hanging over a cliff and this cop let him fall and he cried out "You ooter bastard!".
