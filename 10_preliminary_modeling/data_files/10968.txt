I dreamed that my sister, Martha, my mother and a friend of my sisters were in our kitchen at home. Mother seemed to be cooking on the stove. My sister, her friend and I lounged about talking. Suddenly the back door opened and my father lurched in drunk. I was faintly ashamed that Martha's friend should see him in such a condition. He seemed to have brought with him a florist's box which he laid on the kitchen table (it had a cover on it of red and white checks). It was for me and contained a beautiful orchid. A boy I date at school who lives out of town had sent it to me. Also in the box was a long rambling incoherent letter which seemed to be a declaration of love. I was overjoyed as it proved to me that even though we were separated, he had thought of me.
