I am a soldier. I am with many others by the river. It seems to be a place in the jungle, but I am not familiar with it. We are at war and the enemy is starting to cross the river towards us. We immediately recognize their chief, who is famous and feared by all of us. I shoot at him, hoping to get him, but nothing happens to him. They kept on coming since they realized that we were not going to be able to stop them, so we ran, scared. The chief was a Chinese man of about 30 years whom I did not know. I was very scared of him.
