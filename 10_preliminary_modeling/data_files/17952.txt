I was at the observatory, reporting for duty, with several others.  We were going into war.  Details missing.  I was chosen to be the leader's second-hand person I guess.  There were tons of people everywhere but the leader was an Asian man in a decorative robe.  I held a decorative paper cone.  This was to be placed on the forehead of each soldier as a part of a blessing the leader was giving to everyone.  I put it on my own forehead.  We moved to the front of the line, and began the march.  We looped around a building and there were so many people a lot of them had still not started moving, but we had to stop for some reason.  I went around to the back side of a building, past a mechanic's garage, to see about something.  There were two cats that looked like our (deceased) cat Buster and I stopped to cuddle them a bit.  I realized they looked like him and that's why I was more inclined to take the time to cuddle them.
