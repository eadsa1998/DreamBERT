[1997-06-12] I was looking at an old manual typewriter and it wasn't working right and I turned it upside-down to put a new ribbon in. I know that's not how you put a ribbon in but that's what I did, I turned it upside-down and could feel the ribbon in there. I followed the route of it so I could tell which way it goes and I thought I'd be able to put the new one in. Then I took it out and I found this little round cylinder like cartridge and it was empty I said "Yep, you can tell the ribbon's gone, because the cartridge is empty." So I got the new one and started trying to put it in, but I never was able to get it in, right, I kept routing it in incorrectly and it seemed longer than it was supposed to be and I just couldn't get it to go in right.
