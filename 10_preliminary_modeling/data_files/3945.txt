["Costumed."]  I am in some house and I look in a mirror to see that my hair is dyed black and I have mummy bandages over my face. Sort of a Halloween costume. I need to take care of a child, maybe take him to an appointment when I see this. We are late. It is 2:00 now and the appointment to the eye doctor is at 2:00. I wonder if I should call in and tell them I'll be late. I decide to just hurry and do the best I can. I wash off the makeup and the dye on the hair. I comb out my long curly pretty blonde tresses of hair. A man is surprised to see I have pretty blonde hair. Now I and the child are leaving and the man is n charge of the other children. I see one boy fall into the huge lake. The girl jumps in too. I am upset with the man for not paying attention. I turn around to go get the children out of the water.
