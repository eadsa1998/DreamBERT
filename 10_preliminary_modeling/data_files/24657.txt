I was at the beach with some of my relatives. We started to play cards when some guy ran into my chair and I went face-first into the sand. I won the card game. After the card game, everybody got into their swim suit and played in the water. Me and my cousin ran from waves. Sometimes we did not beat the waves. Then me and my cousin went knee deep in the water and when a wave came we would jump over it. The last one came and I got caught in a piece of seaweed and I was undertowed. Setting: On the beach Miramar in Half Moon Bay down by the water. Characters: My mom, my grandma and grandpa, my aunt Leslie, my uncle Hank, my cousin John and I have no idea who the guy was who ran into my chair. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, scared, worried. I was happy and having fun when we were playing in the waves, but when I was undertowed I was scared and I worried about what would happen to me.
