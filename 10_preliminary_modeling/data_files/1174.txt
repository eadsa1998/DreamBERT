Thursday. I'm sitting in the front row of an audience. Soon it's my turn to go up and do another performance of B.'s Follies. I can't remember the words to the songs. I ask my singing partner (Rosemary). She shrugs her shoulders. She doesn't remember either. I ask Dolores. She doesn't remember. My grandmother Mildred is playing songs on an organ as warm-ups. I'm crying and frantic. I'm panicked. I search through old papers for the words. I don't find the right papers. Dolores reminds me for the second time that it's time to take attendance. I snap at her, "Later. I have to find the words first." I am angry at her insensitivity. I'm panicked and angry at my unpreparedness. I said, "Why didn't I prepare better?"
