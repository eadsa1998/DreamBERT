I was at home. Dad and Ezra were there. Dad said he was going to go out (it was night), so I asked Mom to bring food over. She came over and this cop car went past slowly. It was being dodgy so we swapped Mom's car for mine and then these guys turned up and pointed a gun at Mom's head and mine until they got something. I don't know what happened but they left and we they got back they said the cops pulled them over. I was telling Dad, who was watching something, that the guy on the show he was watching was in Monty Python and that he was my favourite Python (obviously, Michael Palin) and that it was his birthday tomorrow.
