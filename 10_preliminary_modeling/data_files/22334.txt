In a building in downtown Lima (facing San Martin Square). I had convinced a first cousin of mine to have sexual intercourse with me there. After she agreed and started to undress, something made me go out of the apartment for a moment. After I came back, I didn't find her, but instead there was another first cousin of mine, and I demanded that she giver herself to me (having convinced the first one seemed to mean that I had also convinced this one). We started to make love (in a frontal position) in the bathroom, having the floor and the water closet as support, but at that moment I awoke. I want to make two things clear: the girl was having the latter relations without really wanting to, sort of as if that was all she could do, and besides she was in a hurry. Secondly, it seems to be one of my least fantastic dreams. The apartment looked more like a hotel room, because there was only the bedroom and the bathroom. Before this dream I had another of which I remember nothing except that it also dealt with sexual intercourse.
