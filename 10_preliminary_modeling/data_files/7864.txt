I went to Len U's funeral. He was a member of BPE. he was a gentleman who attended the Mensa meeting also and had sent me an email about networking for jobs. This makes me think that it wasn't Len U at all but rather another man that I had met at Mensa and BPE and as described here. When we were at the funeral home I saw his wife and maybe a daughter. When I saw him in his casket I didn't think it really looked like him. We were getting in line to view the body. As we were walking to get in line there were other people laid out in their caskets as well. There was something about after the wake gathering for a meal.
