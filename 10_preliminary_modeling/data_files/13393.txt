I had gotten to school at period three, to miss out on the Physics speech. At lunch, Calvin and Genevieve threw plant stuff in my hair. I was trying to get it out. I went to class and Eugene came. I had Biology, but it was Chemistry. Ms Quintana was the teacher and her hair was all frizzy and she was sick. She marked me absent because I wasn't there earlier. I tried to say that I was here. Mr Reilly was away because he was sick. I sat at the back. The door was at the back left and there were three rows of tables going back from the front (two lots). I sat at the back right table.
