All I can get out of this one is being in a fast traveling station wagon that I'm not driving. I'm being driven through Coral Gables. It's like a demonstration car. Again that sign comes in. There's something that is present. I don't actually see it in the dream, but something that's around. It's M3 female. Also the name Jay Spessard Deholland, a senator seems to be. Not in the dream, but it's connected, associated somehow.
