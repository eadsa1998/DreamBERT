I was walking down the steps from Hitchcock 306 and stopped to look out the window. Someone above me said, "I hope you had a good look. I think you'd better come back up here." I turned and I saw that it was a Gestapo agent. I walked back upstairs and he said he had a job for me. He set me to work in room 306 taking things out of a closet with two separate entrances (like the ones at my church and is not in 306) and piling them outside. Soon I heard dance music and turned to see the room filled with people. I looked and saw Dick, a boy in several of my classes at Reserve coming toward me. He held out his arms and I went to him and we began to dance a rumba. I could even feel myself following his steps. He held me very close.
