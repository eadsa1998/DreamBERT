I am on an expedition to retrieve case notes from my Mexico trip. It is time to write the book based on my research. I ask several Mexican men to help me carry the piles of notes and papers through the woods to the right place. One leaves early another later. I realize I may have put my notes in jeopardy by not keeping them together and supervised. I follow the trail. I can't carry them all myself. I tried. But now I am on a very tall mountain. The owner of the company, a man is showing me what it is like to work in the high altitudes. With so little oxygen, it is dangerous work. I follow him down paths. I see the sheer rock cliff faces we are working on. In order to sleep, you have to strap yourself into a device and be sprayed with sleeping drugs. Then you wake up and continue. The food is odd. A dandelion fluff like thing you nibble on. It is cold and difficult to work. We are mining. Now the man says you find the right way to get to the mine. He'd led me once. I have a very hard time remembering the right paths. Finally, I see I took a wrong path, but I got there anyway. So I learned that all paths lead to the mine. Other workers are there. We are isolated up there. so we are friends to each other. A man feels sad because his love is far away. A woman worker empathizes with him. They talk it over. Another woman worker is going to take a bit of time off and have fun exploring the steep difficult terrain. I feel my irregular heart beat and realize this is taking a huge toll on me physically. I wonder if I will survive it. The mines are important.
