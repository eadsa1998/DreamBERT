["Out of body experience."] I am in bed asleep. I get up and walk into a living room. This place is old and funky like many of my dream places. I see a typewriter with a carbon paper on it sitting on the old couch. There are lots of odd looking machines and machine parts. Dwight has been inventing things again. I go to a black computer monitor and turn it on. I see lots of writing on the screen. I realize I've gone on line and a prepaid telephone card is adding up the charges. I can't remember how to use the computer so I shut it down using Alt and delete keys. Then Dwight's odd machines begin to expand. One is a metal silver cylinder a few feet across and it is growing toward the ceiling. I am concerned it will push through and cause damage. It in fact pushes against the ceiling and bulges it. I hear a loud snap of a 2 x 4 snapping. This doesn't seem safe, so I leave the room and return to my bedroom. I have trouble remembering where it is. I open a door and see myself sleeping in a hospital bed, like my own. I approach myself. I don't look well. I then enter my body and see the blinds on the window and realize my consciousness had transferred back into myself.
