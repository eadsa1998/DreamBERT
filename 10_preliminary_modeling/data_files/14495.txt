I can't remember properly, but I think it was the future. I went into a classroom and everyone was very emotionless and I thought it was like The Invasion (saw a glimpse of it on TV last night). I copied them and this guy was next to me and he was also playing along. A teacher was keeping an eye on us. They gave us work to do. They realized the guy was faking and then they were suspicious of me as well. If you killed them, they would regenerate in a chair. If you got them at the start, and pulled off their head that would be the end (they were sort of Cylon like). I stabbed the teacher and they regenerated in a chair at the front of the class and I pulled their head off and eventually they disappeared. A girl at the front of the class said something so I threw a chair at her. They were all left. There was an episode of Red Dwarf and Kendra (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) was in it. I was reading about the actress and she was born in 1944 and I was telling Mom said she was 50 in Buffy the Vampire Slayer and I was shocked.
