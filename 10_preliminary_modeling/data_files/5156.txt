Derek is painting pictures of mountains. I am trying to paint one too. I have my palette and see a sort of yellowish color up in the right hand corner, an odd color for the sky. Derek starts to dabble in my colors and I ask him not to. I then awkwardly attempt to paint. I draw a steep-peaked mountain and remember what my father said about how mountains aren't really that steep. I redraw it in softer curves. I discover how leaving some portions of the canvas blank and using that whiteness as a part of the picture enhances the picture. I create many different mountain ranges with some kind of building structure in the left corner foreground. It's pretty good. [BL]
