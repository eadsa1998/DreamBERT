We were at a Harris Family reunion. Bruce W was there. I think with his wife. He had a lot of small animals in cages, about the size of Sir Gallahad. They were very unusual. There was a cow and a pig. There were quite a few puppies. One was a bear. They were miniatures. They were all very tame, gentle, and easy to play with. One of the puppies was fighting me a bit so I sat him down or he wiggled out of my hands. Bruce W corralled him back into his care right away.
