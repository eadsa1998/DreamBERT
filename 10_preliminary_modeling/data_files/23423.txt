I have just turned 23 yesterday and that fact was included in my dreams as I am standing on a corner with friend Andrew. Calvin, Alice, Harry, and Jim are walking down a street and try to get Andrew to go with them to bars. I am ignored. Andrew does not go. Otherwise, rest of dream hazy -- running through stuff I need to do such as find new job, etc.
