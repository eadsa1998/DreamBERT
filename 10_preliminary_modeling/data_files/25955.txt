 I'm at a stadium or dome. There are four people in the stadium seats: it is otherwise empty! It seems to be like a Minnesota Twins game. My junior high classmates Pat and Raul Mason are there. I'm not sure how seeing them again will be, and I wonder if it will be competitive. I sit with them and my brother Wally and another man in the seats.
