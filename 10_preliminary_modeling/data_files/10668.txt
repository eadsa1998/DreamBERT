I was babysitting this girl. She had millions of windows in her room and the wind was blowing them open. The little girl fell out of one of the windows. I was able to rescue her. I was trying to close the windows when a truck of strange boys rolled up outside. They wanted me to come to them. I said no. All of a sudden I was outside. This strange lady then came up to me and grabbed my arm. I knew I was being kidnapped. I could barely speak. She took me to a haunted house where many people were lined up to get inside. I tried to grab onto a man who I thought was my dad, but when he turned around, he was a creepy man.
