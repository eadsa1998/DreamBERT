I was checking in to a big hotel with a group of four or five other people my age. And we weren't really going to stay there for the night, but we were going for a late banquet dinner thing. And I can't remember if it was NSC or ABWA, but it was one of those places. And I was supposed to give a speech to this group of people at a banquet, and I was already late, and I was going with a black boy, two white boys and another girl, I think. And we were, they sort of thought they knew way to our rooms, and I think one or two of them had white canes. And they just sort of were showing me the way to get to there, and they were, "Maybe it's this one," open the door and it's dark, "No, not in there." "Maybe it's this one. All these doors are locked." And we went up an escalator and we climbed up a couple stairs and through a little gift shop thing and we were kind of in the wrong place. We weren't supposed to go up that way. And then we went down an escalator that was really, really, really, really tall and sort of had turns like regular stairs do and little landings. And I grabbed the railing and we just sailed down that escalator. It went so fast. And then we ran back to the desk because then we were really late. And the desk person, I think I said, "We're trying to find a big convention room. Where is the banquet going to be for them?" And they said, "Oh, that's in Building 16B." And the thought sunk in that this hotel has sixteen buildings and this was only Building #1, and I was thinking how it sure would be nice of them to get us a carry guy to get a golf cart and take us right to the place we need to be. But they seemed to let us alone and just let us do our thing. We started out the front door and down the sidewalk, and then I woke up.
