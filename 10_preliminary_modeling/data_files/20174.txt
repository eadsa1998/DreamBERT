I tried to swim in a pool with water 3 feet deep, but it was too shallow. A woman dressed like a nurse arose from a chair, spreading her legs as she arose. She said that if I paid admission, I could use the large pool on the other side of the glass wall. I paid her, but when I came to the pool, I found that it was covered with a granite floor. Later I was in a place with high walls and stained glass windows.
