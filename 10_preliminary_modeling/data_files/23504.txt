Bob has borrowed my white truck to use on errands, but when he comes back he is without it. Where is my truck? He says he left it on the street in a bad neighborhood. I get panicky and yell at him -- "How could you leave my truck there??" He is unresponsive. I go find the truck and the tires are slashed. I am upset. I yell at him some more. I am so angry and can't believe how passive he is being.
