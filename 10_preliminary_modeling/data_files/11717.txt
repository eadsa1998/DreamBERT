I was at school, and I had weird lolly/chocolate things. I was sharing them with Cedric, who was sitting next to me. I went to walk out and Gavin was acting weird, and I thought he was going to ask me out. I went into these woods and Cedric and Mathias were there chanting something. The only way to get out was by going through these puzzle rooms. I finally got out.
