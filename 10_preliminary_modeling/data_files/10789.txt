I dreamed of a very good friend of mine. He is 32, works at Marshall Field and Co. in Chicago. He is very overweight, but with such a personality that everyone likes him. In the dream he came here to Cleveland to see me. When he arrived, I found he had lost a lot of weight, really looked swell. He had done it to surprise me and I was very happy and proud.
