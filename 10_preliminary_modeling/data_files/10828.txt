I was working in a hospital. Suddenly I received an emergency call to go right home because our cat George was very ill. I hurried home and there I found my mother crying beside George who seemed to be perspiring and choking. I picked up a pair of scissors and began cutting off his fur. The fur didn't come off very easily so I skinned him. He didn't seem to be getting any better so I rushed him to the hospital. There the doctor said he had only a few days to live. He said that if I had brought George right to the hospital instead of skinning, he would have gotten better. I just stood in the doctor's office and cried.
