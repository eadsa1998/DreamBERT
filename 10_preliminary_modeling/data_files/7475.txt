Mary is in a bathroom. She is just beginning, or ending, her bath and toilet. She looks gorgeous. She is slender, and her dark hair is done in a late 19th century style. She is wearing a housecoat or bathrobe which is modishly cut and clings closely to the contours of her body. She is happy, is smiling and talking to me. She tells me that she is preparing to attend a special, old-fashioned party.
