There was some disease thing where under everyone's skin were these little maggot like creatures. One guy went to a lady to get rid of them. He stood naked and they rolled over his body. It was a fairly painful procedure and he would lose bits of skin and stuff and he chose to keep his hair, so it showed the maggots crawling around under the skin on his head. Mittens was infected.
