I walk over to see my psychiatrist who lives in a large, white stucco house (like ours?). A sign reads: Dr. Roreach, Psychiatrist. He lives on the 3rd or 4th floor. I walk up many flights of stairs with Reynaldo. I see him conducting a tour. See a very handsome man from Vienna. He explains something about a picture. "This is the Mozart Museum."
