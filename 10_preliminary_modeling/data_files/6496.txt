Bitter and angry about everything in Hillside. The Market was closing, and they wouldn't let me withdraw money. Ended dream by strangling Jimmy because he wouldn't park his damn van, just kept driving it back and forth. Laura ran up at the same moment and asked what I was doing -- just then I woke up and she was staring at me. Angry like I can't usually be -- at *everything*. Punching walls of the van. Then, after getting rid of Jimmy, we had a bum in our room. We were sitting there talking and he kind of transformed into Alan. He tells me (gold ring in his ear) It's better to be a free man than a bondsman. (Echoes of Thomas More!) I told him that all walks of life come with their own worries, troubles, bothers. He then changed into that guy from a local coffee shop, the grey-haired guy with the leather coat. He began to lecture me in that condescending way bums have when they think you don't understand just how demeaning and uncomfortable their lives are. "Now listen John, Joseph, James Josh..." He began every sentence directed at me with this formula. At one point I opened the door to force him out.
