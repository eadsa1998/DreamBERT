I was watching Mulholland Dr. Dad and Ezra were there. The lights weren't working properly, which had happened before. I watched TV. I was staying at home. People kept going weird and trying to kill me (including Clayton and Samantha). I ran to a deli. Samantha was there and ordered a "mint tableau". I got some thing and I needed to get a drink to get water. They only had coffee and I had a look for Choc Milk, but they didn't have any. No-one wanted a drink. Eugene was there.
