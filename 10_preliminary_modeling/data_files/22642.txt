I and a group of classmates from the university had gotten together for a job that was offered by a lady whose behavior seemed dubious to me, and I wanted to consult somebody, but she was talking and getting to confuse the others. She needed to know our responsibilities, everything relating to the task she was entrusting us with. However, everybody acted blinded by their emotions. It was impossible for me to express myself.
