I'm taking a shower or bath. There are lots of free miniature things in a plastic bag -- tiny shampoos, soaps, irons, hem mending kits etc -- all one could use to keep things clean and tidy and comfortable. I don't use them and then notice I'm sitting in the tub on my towel. I don't even have a dry towel! I see I left soap on my face on the left cheek.
