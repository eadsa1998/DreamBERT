I was at home alone at night. I heard a noise and saw 2 neighbours trying to break in. There was a girl and a guy and I'd seen the guy before. I got their attention and they took off. Later, they were there again and had opened the door. I called the police and they did as well so the line was engaged. I got through and they left again. I was a little scared, but mostly annoyed.
