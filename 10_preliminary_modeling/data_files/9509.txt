Frank takes us and children to Presbyterian Church. Big fuss but then they discover I belong to Greek Orthodox Church. I admit we belong, but hesitate to ask if Frank would prefer P., but he doesn't answer! Return to St. Mary's with children and then on long trip in trolley. Don't know where it is taking us - I lose a valuable card with some writing on it. -- dream of Vienna with Frank - see all the old streets, houses, hills, theaters, etc. tell Frank about it.
