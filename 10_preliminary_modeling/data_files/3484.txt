I am a waitress at a cafe. My woman boss is very meek. I tell her to remember she is the boss and I teach her to be assertive. A young couple is at one back table. They are in love. Now the playwright group gathers. Eric has some stuff to share. I see the name "B" on one. He announces he has won a short story contest in an important newspaper. I say, "I am envious," but I also am aware the story is about me, so I'm also happy or curious. He starts to read the story, then pauses and says, "I have finally learned what it takes to write, after all these years. You just write...from the heart." I smile because I knew that and he is absolutely right. I'm thinking this story about me, then, must be emotional and from the heart. This pleases me. Now he reads it. It says "WELCOME, B." in headlines. Then it says, "I find you in many places, in between the thin mucus layers of my ____" (a body part, maybe the nose). "You are in 482 points in my" (another body part), "and in 7008 places in my (stomach lining?)" Then he goes on to describe trees and the (state) scenery and so on. I feel a bit disappointed and comment, "I don't like the ending." It doesn't feel like the story had continuity. How can this story have been good enough to win the contest?
