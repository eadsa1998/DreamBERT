 I'm crawling through the attic at home, towards the far end. I encounter lights that are turned on, in the attic. I think this is odd. I near the end of the attic and there are more lights on. I see and hear my mom and a small, open, lit room that is beyond the end of the attic via a small passageway around the left side of the main attic. My mom is surprised to see me, as if she is trying somewhat to keep the existence of the room a secret. She says something like, "You didn't think there was nothing above my room, did you?" I'm confused and dumbfounded. I say no, accepting and realizing that there is a room above my mom's bedroom.
