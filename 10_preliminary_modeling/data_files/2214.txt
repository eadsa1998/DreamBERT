I'm in a bedroom sand I'm a little scared. There are "entities" in there. Ernie and Ginny are there too. I leave the room to go take a bath. I leap out of bed very healthily. I say, "Maybe I should stay. They also healed me." I take the bath and go back to that bedroom, still a little nervous but needing the good healing energy. I get in bed. Ernie curls up with me. He is gentle and loving and I realize this is friendship, not sexual. I relax in his embrace.
