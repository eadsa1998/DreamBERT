I feel strong violation. Willie and Nate have raped me. I feel sad when I see Abner and then with difficulty remember that he didn't do the raping. I am relieved because I like him. A Robin Williams kind of man is very gentle and nice. I am afraid of him but I also want his affection. I like him. I see the pictures of two small girls (maybe 4 or 5 years old) looking very sweet and innocently sexy. I feel strong sadness and anger that these children were molested by the rapers.
