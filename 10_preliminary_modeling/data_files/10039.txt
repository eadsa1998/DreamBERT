We are living in a very modern house on a hill, but it has many defects: it is too cold and cannot be properly heated; finally the head of the Art School comes to help us out, but he set FIRE to the house from below. I see the orange conflagration clearly and I am relieved that the fire has not spread and that we are safe. We live with friends in the mean time; When I return to see the burned house, I find that NOTHING REMAINS&gt;
