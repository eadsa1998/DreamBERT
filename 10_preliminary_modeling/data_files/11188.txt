I dreamt that I had to take a psychology test. If I missed the test, I would get a bad grade. I was over at Adelbert watching the fellows practice football. I had a little more studying to do and I couldn't make myself do it. When I looked at my watch, I was very late for my test. I ran all the way to the room where I was having the test. I only had a few minutes for the test. I could not stay over because I had lab in the afternoon. I was sure the test would be on something I didn't know. Sure enough, I was handed a piece of paper and then a piece of coal. It was reddish brown and I was supposed to tell what the reddish brown color on the outside was. I didn't have any idea of the answer.
