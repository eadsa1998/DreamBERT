I am in a house. I am renting it from  high school friend Dora's mom and dad for $78.00 a month. Dora comes to visit and is impressed with the house. I say, "You should see how many toilets and kitchens I have." I take her on a tour and there are at least three separate apartments in the house, only it's all one house. The bottom rooms are lovely: two bedrooms, a sitting room, kitchen and bath (three toilets). A man tries to sneak out and I realize he's been living there on the sly. He asks if he can stay. I suggest he pay rent. "How much?" he asks. "$100 apiece," I say (he has a friend). I am very pleased with myself that I would get more money than I'm putting out and therefore make a profit.
