I was with a female roommate. It was Jacqueline Smith, the actress. Maybe I wasn't with her. She went into the apartment and this man was there. She had a condom and he had one too. One was lying on a bedside table. He said see, we're supposed to have sex, and we're supposed to do it twice. Something else happened and he said something to confirm that too. She did. After they both had their clothes off, he got under the blanket and then came out with a small axe and started slitting her throat. I was there at that point, because I ran out and I tried slamming doors shut behind me and locking them. I ran out into a neighbor's house and knocked on their front door and hid behind a bush so he wouldn't see me if he came after me. I think he did. I think he took me back to the apartment. When I got into the apartment I went into a room and pushed the door shut and tried pushing a bookshelf in front of it. That wasn't strong enough to keep him out. I realized I would have to push more bookshelves against it to keep him out.
