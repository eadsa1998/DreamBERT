I had a paddle and I hit a cat with it up into the air. Then later I hit that cat again and I hit her hard. She went up about 25 ft. When she landed, she bounced like a ball about 3 times. I thought I would give her a real hard bat, so I ran after her and then finally hit her and she turned into a green tomato. I could see the dent in the tomato where I hit it. A kid was shooting his cap gun at a grasshopper. He put the gun close to the grasshopper and shot. The grasshopper would jump a couple times, then the boy would get close to him and shoot it again. I had a different number of the sixth at Pimlico.
