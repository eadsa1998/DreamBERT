I was living in an apartment with these other two guys, and we got into an argument about something. We decided on going out somewhere. I tried on these pants. I'm not sure whether they were mine or not, but the cuffs were real funny. They were too short. I made some sort of joke about it and everybody laughed. Then I turned the cuffs down. I got the cuffs worked out so that they looked alright. They were a pair of black pants with red stripes. Then I went out with these two girls and we were going swimming or something. There was a conversation or something about hair color. This one girl said that I was a real blond, and I said no, I didn't think I was blond particularly. She said, "Oh yes, look, you have a long blond hair growing out of a pimple on your hand," and I looked down and sure enough. She grabbed it and pulled it out. Then I took the long blond hair away from her. I looked at it closely and there actually seemed to be several long hairs with several little pimples like at the end of them. Then I made some comment about every 3 or 4 months I seemed to have a rhythmicity and oiliness of my skin. That was about the end of the dream. Day residue: The pants cuff--I've got a pair of pants that I wear to school that has the cuffs turned down because they're too short, and one of the cuffs is torn. This last week my face has broken out again, so that would account for the pimples.
