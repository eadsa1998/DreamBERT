In the audience for Stephen Colbert, but it was like a stand up thing. I think I knew him or worked there. He called me up on stage for something and I was wearing patoonkis. I sat on the stage like |_'- (or whatever you call that). He was doing some long quiz thing - he handed it out to everyone, including me, and we had to fill it out. It had random questions and basically wanted you to give funny answers but I couldn't think of any. I had recently started going out with this guy called Jeb? He wasn't really typical of my type, but he was decently attractive. There was an Asian restaurant thing that was only open for breakfast. It opened at 4am-9.30am I think. I was there at 5am one morning because I couldn't sleep. I was there with Mom, but then I was there with Jeb and maybe others. When I finished my food, I cleaned up my table (I think it was a recommended thing to do) and one of the ladies working there commented that everyone had cleaned their tables and saved them a lot of work. At some point, I hadn't seen Jeb for a while and was getting worried that he was bored with me. He worked with/knew Colbert, and I mentioned this to him and he talked to Jeb for me. Apparently he had just been busy and was also having trouble 'restraining' himself from going further and I was like 'I don't mind if he doesn't'. I met up with him later and we were in a store, going up an escalator.
