Can remember very little of this dream. Most vivid is the fact that my unmarried girlfriend GS was having a baby. It seems as if we were in the living room. GS was surrounded by her mother, me and several other people. She admitted that the father was SM, her boyfriend at school. She told us without tears just how it happened. She seemed sort of happy, so I got happy rationalizing that now she would be able to marry him right away.
