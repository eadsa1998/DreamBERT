I was walking along the top of a mountain when suddenly a chasm opened before me. It happened so quickly that I couldn't stop. I started to fall, but the chasm wasn't very wide and I managed to stop my fall by bracing my feet against one wall and my shoulders against the other. Then I looked down, and it seemed as though I could see down for at least a mile. At the bottom were a lot of tiny houses. I was terribly frightened, because I was growing tired and I knew I would soon fall. I woke up then, but every time I closed my eyes I could see that long drop. I finally had to get a book and read a while before I could go back to sleep.
