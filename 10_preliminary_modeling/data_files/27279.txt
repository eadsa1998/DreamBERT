We (all the girls I know at school) were in the Stunt- Stunt Night. The stunts were going on, and ended. All was confusion - people - noise. My father was there (unexplainedly). Finally it was time to go back to the dorm to change clothes for the dance. One girl and I were going to the dorm when I suddenly realized that I hadn't seen my date all evening. I was lost - afraid - lonely.
