I was inside a mall at a stoplight.  I and another car sat waiting for a while, and the light didn't seem to be changing.  Nobody was coming so I went ahead and made a left turn.  This happened twice.  I went into a store.  It was after nine, and the mall was closing.  I was surprised the store itself wasn't closed yet, but the clerks seemed to be standing talking to each other, almost as if they were waiting for us.
