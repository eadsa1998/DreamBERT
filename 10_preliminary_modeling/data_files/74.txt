I am outside, in the midst of a few small frame houses that may be out in the country, but not far out - certainly they're not in town. It's very "family" out here, everybody's close. I'm going toward one of the houses - is it my house? I think I'm just staying here on a visit. Between me and the house is a strange being - a girl with fur. I'm not thinking of her as a "cat-girl", but that is the sort of fur - I don't really know if she has a tail or not. (I may have thought it up after I woke up.) She's also very friendly, and we like each other a lot, though for a moment when we came together I was apprehensive. We talk a bit - I don't remember the conversation, but it's something to do with the reason I'm here, which is a wedding or something. In any case, someone is in transition. We go to another house where there's a gathering of people for this event - we seem to be helping pack up to move out of the house. There's an atmosphere rather like Christmas here, with people and things about. (The girl with fur has now changed to regular skin - she has dark, short hair, kind of pretty, lively, we are friends.) We are in one room - the living room, I guess, and I go into the next room, which is darker, and there's a group of things on the floor to deal with - I think some of them are presents, and there's wrappings about. Interesting stuff, and I believe there's wine bottles.
