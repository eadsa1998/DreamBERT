I am lying on the floor of my house next to the fireplace with my calico cat A. Somehow the sliding glass door to the back yard opens up and a black stray cat wanders inside. This cat has a scraggly appearance with unkempt hairs standing out from its body; in general it is ugly. A. sees the other cat and instantly runs toward it. I am quite concerned that the two cats will start fighting, but from my prone position am unable to reach either cat. A. rubs up against the black cat, and they act friendly toward each other. The ugly cat rolls itself up into a smooth black ball and A. rolls herself up into a smooth white ball. The two balls of fur continue rubbing each other and I hear a lot of purring.
