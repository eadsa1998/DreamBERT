I'm in a store looking at all the things. I see small dolls who are in wheel chairs. They are sort of Poster Kids all dressed up in pretty dresses as they are part of a choir that performs. I pick up one, a girl in a pink dress and in a manual chair. She is sort of alive. I put her back. I look at a picture of their choir director, a man with a motorcycle and brace on one leg and an amputated stump on the other. I go on looking at other things in the store. [BL]
