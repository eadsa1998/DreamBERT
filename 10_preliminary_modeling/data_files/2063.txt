I'm going to teach some people basketball and I'm calling them to gather around. I see that the hallway is too narrow and small and I tell them to go upstairs to a larger space. They are slow and complain. They are the parents of school children. One asks if we'll learn tennis. I say, "No, that's for spring. This is winter and we'll learn basketball." Finally I get them gathered together. I had looked down the staircase which is very long and lots of stairs and hoped I didn't cause problems for any disabled ones.
