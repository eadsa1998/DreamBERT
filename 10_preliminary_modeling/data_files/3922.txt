["Aunt Rosalie and Dirty Laundry."] I am at some family reunion in a house. I realize now I need to clean up my mess. I try to gather up the wet, dirty laundry that's been sitting on the table for a week now. My aunt Rosalie is very angry at me for being lazy and not helpful. She is yelling at me and I get angry and yell back at her. We are standing there, screaming at each other in an angry argument. After it is over, I say well, I didn't like the confrontation but at least now I've said my piece and I've been heard. I feel relief. Aunt Naomi walks with me asking if I am all right. She is loving and concerned for me.
