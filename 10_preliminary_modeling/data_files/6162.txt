I was at the train station ready to go home. My friends came down to the train station (Park Street Station) to get me to go with them. I went with them. I threw my schoolbag in the train (when the train was here). We were playing chase. Later it was time for me to go home. I realized that I didn't have my schoolbag with me, so I went back to the station and waited for the train to come. The first one arrived. I asked the driver did he see a schoolbag in his train. He said no, and instead threw me some keys with an address tag clipped with it. I decided to send it back. I was still waiting. The second train came. I asked him the same thing. I saw my schoolbag. I went to get it and went to get my car. The dream stopped here, and I woke up.
