I'm called into the community college "Board Room" to explain some financial decisions I made when I was working at Disability Student Services. I'm nervous and can't imagine what I may have done wrong. I walk in. People are surprised at how improved I am. They have a space without a chair ready for me at the round table. I pull up a chair and sit. A bright spotlight kind of light is shining in my eyes. I see people, women, setting things up. They bring boxes of things. I realize it's going to be an award to honor me. They say, "Bring them in," and I watch as young girls, disabled women and Indian women come in to observe. They nod respectfully at me. I am their sole role model. A male teacher comes in and wants to have his lunch as he usually does in this room. He's annoyed and complains we've taken away his privileges. I suggest he use the teacher's lounge at the other end of the building. He is not happy. He's going to ruin my awards program.
