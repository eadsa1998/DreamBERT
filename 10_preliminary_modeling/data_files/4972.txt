I am in my wheelchair, looking for a place to park near the theatre so I won't have to walk far. It's very crowded and I end up far away. I see an attendant, sort of a mechanic and chew him out because there is no disabled parking. He has an arrogant look on his face. He says, "Are you one of those hippie type trouble makers?" I look at him with some contempt and say, "I am a counselor here at XXX." He is very impressed. He offers to escort me there. As we walk together, arm in arm, he smiles and asks me out. I think, "He's only a mechanic, but it might be fun to go out for awhile." Then I find out that the person that is scheduled to play the Queen in the play can't, and I am to do it. I have an hour before curtain. Marti S tells me to make frowny faces to the sounds people make. We're all sitting at a table. I do so. One woman thinks I'm pretty strange. I'm nervous. I don't even know the story line much less the words! Marti S says, "No problem, you'll do fine," and then goes away. I wait for her but she doesn't return. Howard is the director of the play. I tell him I'm not ready. He says, "Sure you are." He has confidence in me and doesn't do anything to help me. I get a 12 hour extension. I then realize that I have the Queen characterization down very well, I just need to memorize the words. I feel that I can succeed. I wear a black ornate lacy dress and a wig. I am very regal. [BL]
