The phone rings. Thom York (singer from Radiohead) answers. I say hello and quickly explain who I am, and that I'd like to meet him to talk about a video project. Surprisingly he agrees. So I turn up at an address by a river or a canal - it reminds me of Amsterdam.  I'm shown in by a tall guy with dark hair - apparently a guitarist. "Thom's about but he's not feeling too good" he said. He shows me out onto a terrace over looking the canal. There's a few chairs and a large tree with one of those circular iron grills around the foot of it. "Thom's not alright" says the guitarist lighting a cigarette, dragging and flicking ash onto the ground which is covered in cigarette butts. "He was diagnosed with a rare form of alzheimers. He may live for years, but he's very depressed about it, and he's decided to go to Switzerland in the new year to commit suicide." "That's terrible" I say. Back inside I find Thom, unshaven, a bit distracted, having a cup of tea. He's dressed in jeans and a t-shirt and bare feet. He's congenial - even quite enthusiastic about my project. I don't even know what it is myself to be honest, but he seems to buy into it. My suggestion is that it would be collaboration The budget was small, but we'd have the freedom to experiment. He perks up a bit, and I get the impression his trip to Switzerland might be put on hold.
