I went driving in a carpark. All these fast red cars came. All these people came too. Mom, Ezra and I went outside. This old, ugly British guy was there and he and Mom were going out. I was trying to go up this hill. Mom was talking on the phone to someone. The person she was talking to blew up. This old lady was trying to organize this wedding and there was a canteen nearby that you bought wedding rings from.
