I was babysitting, and then I left the kid at his house and went to a garage sale. When I came back, three of my friends were in the house with three kids they were babysitting for. Then we had a party. Setting: At the kid's house (who I was babysitting). Characters: Me, the kid I was sitting for, three friends, three kids they were babysitting for. Feelings and Thoughts: Surprised. I really want to babysit my little next door neighbor.
