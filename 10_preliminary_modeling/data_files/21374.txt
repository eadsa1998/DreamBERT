I seemed to look at the first and second races and I picked the horses in them. And when I came to the 3rd race it seemed that Ann said, "It's 5-5-5." She seemed to repeat the fives and meant 5 pp in the 3rd race. I was working on some wood job. I put a part over a stick and then hit the top of the stick with my hammer to lean it over. I came to one and a boy looked into the package and said, "This one has too many rights."
