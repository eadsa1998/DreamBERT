I'm at Disneyland with my friend Marcie. I was giving her a tour because she'd never been there before. It was a walking tour. We never actually got on a ride. I had no money. She wanted to buy a monkey. I thought she wanted a real one, but she ended up buying a toy one. We were on a hill which we fell down. We went into a bathroom and a bunch of football players ran by. We got on a bus to go back to the hotel. We drove through mountains and there was a cemetery to the right and all the tombstones had hearts on them and two people's names. I turned to look at Marcie who was sitting next to me and she had turned into my friend Jane.
