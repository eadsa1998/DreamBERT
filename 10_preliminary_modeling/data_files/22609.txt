I dreamt that I was walking alone downtown and, as always, there were lots of people there (I did not recognize anybody). I was window-shopping and in a little store -- I don't know which one (but it seemed familiar) - there was a yellow dress that I liked. I went in and asked how much it cost and whether they had it in my size, and the salesgirl told me that it cost $20, but they did not have it in my size (in that color) and that she did not think that they were going to get a dress like that. I came out of the store rather sad and went on walking in the streets, and I saw crystal lamps and chandeliers which were lit and very pretty in a big store that had that sort of merchandise. The last thing I remember is that I went inside that store.
