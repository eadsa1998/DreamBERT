I looked across the room and see a light wood chest with a brass latch under the window. I thought "now I'll put bedding in it." I took things out of the old chest under the bed, an old-much worn napkin plainly marked M.E. Smith diagonally across one corner, an old Turkish towel, etc. I miss the old brown and green cover from the old chest. Some one knocks and I go to the door. A man and a woman who reminds me of Mrs. McB. Are there but they won't come in. Conclude they must have wanted the next door and I go back to work. Another knock, I usher in 4 people. Mrs. McB, N.D. and two very plump women, a mother and her daughter, Sally. I apologize for the upset room, explaining that I had just discovered the chest. "Isn't that funny?" A man and woman take my large chair and stool, face and talk to each other. Sally stands around a bit and leaves. I talk to the two other women.
