It was in an auditorium. The seats were hard, old-fashioned ones of wood, not padded seats, but they curved a little bit. There was a big aisle down the middle. (I knew because I walked down the aisle to get to my seat.) I was sitting between Betty and Pat. The instructor of the Speech class was up front. We were supposed to give speeches that day. I was sitting there and thinking what I was going to say. Then he called my name, so I got up and handed my notes to Pat, and she said, "Do you want me to go up the aisle with you?" And I said, "No, I am going to go up myself." And I went down the aisle in a fast, determined pace and while I was going, the instructor said, "You know, Miss Green, it's surprising that you are as good as you are because I had a woman in this class a year ago who..." and I didn't give him a chance to finish. (The aisle was slanting down.) I got down where it was flat, turned around with my back to him and faced the audience, and commenced to deliver a speech on how rotten I thought the course was, how poorly organized, and poorly administered it was. And I woke up.
