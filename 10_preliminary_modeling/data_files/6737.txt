It is good we are in different houses, it gives us some place to visit, not so alone in this isolated place. "But I wish we were not so far from a town.' Old fashioned. There are only three chests of drawers. We are now upstairs and I'm trying to divide drawer space with sisters. Where will we put these pillboxes. They'll spill power all over. In those small drawers in mother's bureau. First I'm dividing with R., then with H. and M. also. The 4 boys have the large bedroom, the 3 girls another, parents the small one but that leaves H. out. We'll have to have 4 girls to one room.
