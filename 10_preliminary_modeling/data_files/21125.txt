I was outside and the smoke from the city was blowing over Parma. I could smell the bad odor from it. I looked at the smoke as it floated over Parma. I was reading a book and I had to focus the distance to see it clear. Hank and I were taking our tools to do some kind of a job. A piece of paper flew out of my hand across the street, then the wind carried it back past me.
