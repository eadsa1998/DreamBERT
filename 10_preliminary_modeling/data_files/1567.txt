I am in the back seat of a car. My father is driving. Ellie, Paulina and Charla are in the back with me and my mother is in the front. I look to my left and see two red limos driving. I peer into one and see an older woman. I recognize her as a famous writer. I am quite thrilled and roll the window down and stare at her. She looks up. I take Charla and hold her up saying, "Look. Isn't she cute?" The woman passes a note to me. I feel the wind between the cars, grab at it and hang on tight. I then read it. It is in very small writing and is a list of some kind. It also has her name and address on it. It also says, "You have talent." I feel very happy. Her car speeds up and goes ahead of us. She's now in the back trying to say something to me. I can't make it out but it feels important. I tell my father to speed up so I can see her lips. He starts to and then sees a bridge up ahead and slows down. He's afraid that bridge goes into New York City and he turns left. I see a sign that says "Permanent Terminal." I am very agitated and demand that my father stop the car. He's telling Paulina and others to get out and watch for traffic. I hop out quickly and push him out of the driver's seat. My mother is yelling at him. I get in and say, "I'm not afraid to drive through New York City." I turn us back to the freeway and speed up to catch up with the woman.
