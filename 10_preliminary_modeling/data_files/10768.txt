I dreamed that somebody was taking my temperature. I was afraid that I really had a fever, so I didn't want the person to come near me with the thermometer. Someone had said not to touch the thermometer on a certain point - otherwise the mercury would all run out in a steady stream. I must have touched it and the next thing I knew, all the mercury was running around the room.
