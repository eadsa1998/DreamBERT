I was in a supermarket which was near to the Technical College, or like part of it. I think I bought some stuff but I may have been doing some work there? I went to class and left a kebab there. I went and did something and then came back and saw Justus eating a kebab. At first I thought it was mine, but then I saw mine was still there.
