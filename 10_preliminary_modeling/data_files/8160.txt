I was in a house that I lived in with 3-year-old Matthew. It was the middle of the day. We were outside. Matthew was riding his big wheel. I was walking while he was riding. We had gone quite a little distance. He had asked me something and then I turned away from him. When I turned back I couldn't see him anymore. Even though it looked like a straight view as far as I could see in all directions around me, I couldn't see him anywhere. I just panicked. I started running and yelling and calling out his name. I couldn't find him. I finally decided I didn't want to walk away yet. I knew that I couldn't move very fast this way because I was walking. I finally decided to go back to the house and get the car and drive to find him. So I went back to the house and got my keys. I was dressed for work. I went outside to get in the car and there he was - sitting there on his big wheel, looking as though he knew he was in trouble and he was so dirty. Before I could say anything, he was talking - as though he was alot older than three - you didn't even have to say it. I've been yelled at by, I don't know whom, but these other people already yelled at him. So I didn't say anything right away. I picked him up and held him but out away from me because he was so dirty and I didn't want to get my work clothes all dirty. I took him in the house and thought about sitting him down but he was so dirty and I didn't want to get the dirt all over the carpet. So I took him into the bathroom and was going to just sit him right in the tub. It was as if he was cooperating with his body. I said okay fine. So when I actually went to sit him down he ended up on his stomach and kind of sliding down. But then he ended up sitting up.
