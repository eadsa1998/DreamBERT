I am in a bathtub and Ellie is shampooing my hair. She puts on too much shampoo and as I lay back in the water, I can't get it all rinsed out. Ellie is in a hurry and I insist I try and rinse more off by putting my head under the shower! The water is cool and not very much of it. I check my body temp and its only 90 degrees, a sub temperature. I feel cold and not very much energy.
