Sam Beckett was trying to save my dorm floor mate Carol from jumping into a dangerous rapid from a cliff.  Everyone started to go down through the water and bedding of leaves, and I had to save Sam.  Another part of the dream, everyone at school was working on projects.  My dorm friend Peter and some friends were filming something and they wanted my help.  Swallow something, for the image.  I swallowed my key for them.  I got back to my room and realized I couldn't find it...and then I thought of where it was.  I started yelling, upset.  I went and told Peter he owes me $75.  I went and talked to the guy down the hall, Aaron.  I came back and was eating something, and I realized it wasn't going down easily- I got hopeful and reached into my throat.  A little further, a little further, and I managed to pull the key out.  I was happy.
