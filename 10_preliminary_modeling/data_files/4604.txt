Now I'm sitting at a table in a booth waiting for the 2nd meeting. I see Ellie and Charla come in. A few social workers come in. A man stands by me telling me we need to move over to the booths to make more room for more social workers. I sigh. Here we go again. The man has glasses on. He is also very warm and friendly. He shows me some pictures of him as he was growing up. I see his orchestra picture. He has drawn a box around himself in all the photos so I'll know which one is him. I wish he'd let me guess first. I smile at his boyish face. I see he played his violin. He is standing behind me and leaning in very close. I lean back into his arms and say Did you ever play 1st violin? He laughed and says yeah. Sometimes. I smile. Me too. I say. We laugh at the fun of us having these same experiences. I enjoy him and he enjoys me.
