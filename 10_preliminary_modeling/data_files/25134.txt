 I'm watching an opera, but it's outside and there are two younger children performing in it. It finishes quickly and people leave. I am at the local convenience store. It has three levels. On the top floor there is a bar. Some teenagers go there and buy soft drinks. The main level is the one with the cash register, and the lower level goes to al back door from which you must jump down three feet to get to the ground. My mom is there. We parked her station wagon in a driveway-like space on the west side of the store. There is another station wagon exactly alike ours parked in front of ours. My mom has some bags of food. I'm going to put them in the car so we can leave. I need the keys. The bags are heavy and the plastic handles rip when I pick the bags up. I get the keys and carry the bags in my arms. A girl is with me, helping. There is a long line to get into the store. I check in a notepad for something. <br/
