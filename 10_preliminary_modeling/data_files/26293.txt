 I'm at the Uptown mall. There is a man on a bicycle, with a baby and some books in a basket mounted on the front of the handlebars. The man is sitting backwards on the bicycle, and is not holding onto the handlebars with his hands. He coasts across the mall towards a stand that is set up outside of Smith's Sports. He is going to crash into the stand, and he tries to brake. He can't find the brake, and then his foot hits the brake, which is a hand brake: he is lucky! Jack Krane, one of my old bosses, rides by me on a bicycle in the mall. He comes very close to hitting me. I jump back as he rides by, and he says, "Excuse me." I say, "No problem", and continue on. I see my friends Holly Lapson and Terry Foss walking. I way hi to them, particularly to Terry because I talked to her a bit last week. I move slowly. I have trouble moving when I'm nervous: it's like slow motion. I move normally when I'm relaxed. I recognize what I have to do is relax. I go to the Nordstrom's house in Oak Valley on Home Avenue to play poker with my friends Brittany Johnson and Jana Green.
