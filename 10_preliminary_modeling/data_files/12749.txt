I was at Mom's. She did my hair etc. Then I went home. I was playing with these hair dyes. There was a purple one and I was taking pictures. I realized I needed to wash hair and I called Mom and she got me and Ezra. We went to this caravan which was next to Samantha's house. There were Christmas presents there which Dad had got. He had got me three puzzles. Then we were at Mom's house. I put on my Spongebob shirt instead of my school shirt by mistake. We went to McDonald's for breakfast and Ezra was like "Not again!". [That morning, we got McDonald's for breakfast, and Ezra basically said that].
