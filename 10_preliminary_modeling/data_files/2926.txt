I have two or three more dreams this morning where the relationship with Curtis continues. We are lovers and can't get enough of each other. He asks how often we'll have sex and I say, "As often as you like." I want him all the time and he me. We are on tour with the band. The boys of his band are not happy I'm around, but tolerate me because they have no choice. We sleep, make love, and sleep again. It never seems to stop. We are together constantly. I am happy. I take some of my children's books to the librarian in this town we play at. I tell her what the other librarian had said about my books not being professionally done and what the problems are. I wonder why I do this. She won't want to buy, but it seems important to be honest. In the later dream, I go around the rooms asking where he is; I want to watch him creating a story because I can learn from this. I enter a room where the boys of the band are watching TV and ask if he's there. One says yes. I see him laying on the floor watching a movie he's made. He looks over to see our reactions to his acting. I go lay down to watch with him and notice I lay down a few feet away from him. This is the first time in our intense relationship where some small distance was OK. I move a drying toddler's outfit off a wire and lay it on the floor so I can see the TV better. I feel it (it's corduroy material) to see if it's dry. It is. Earlier a woman came to sing for him. She's good and I take her videotape to him. Her older mother or manager says a word that sounds Native American as her name. Maybe there is Marci energy in her as well. I wonder if it is smart of me to introduce her to my man Curtis.
