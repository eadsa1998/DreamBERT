I kept missing school for one reason or another, even that I was going to meet some people somewhere. We were going on this like underground bus system, and the bus driver couldn't really see the signs as to where to go, and we were afraid she might fall off the thing, fall off the path and go down into this oblivion. And we got off and Mom called her to make sure she got to the place where she was going, and we were at lunch and then I realized it was 12:40 and there was no point in going back. Then I dreamt that I had Chemistry first period. Another dream I had was that -- I can't remember it now.
