I was teaching my class of nurses at the hospital. The first part of the lecture started off slowly as I was busy opening up my mail. There were about six or seven pieces of mail that had arrived. Most of it was junk mail advertising books or containing bills, but I was nervous and seemed to be using this as an excuse to delay the class. I looked at my watch and it was twenty minutes to the hour, which meant that I was ten minutes late. I felt I had better begin. There had also been some comments from the girls among themselves that indicated their impatience for me to start. When I did start it seemed as if I were rather stumbling and halting in my delivery, which seemed unusual to me at the time because usually I do not particularly feel self-conscious when starting a lecture. <br/
