I am in a building, a bar or performance area. I see two women who are part of an improv group performing. They are good. I walk up some stairs to see them. They suggest we walk across the street to go into a gift/drug store. They start walking with more people up the street. I cross the street, wondering if I misunderstood where we were going. They realize I was right and swing across the street. We go in, and split up to look at different sections. I say I'll go look at the light fixtures and things. I see some Xmas decorations on a turn around rack. Then I'm talking with a man about a plumber. They want me to sign up for their construction company. I become aware they (like the women) are Saturday Market types. I am hesitant to sign with them. I keep asking questions about prices and services. They insist I have to sign up right away. I want more time to consider. I start to walk back to the original place. I see a woman on a bench and I sit by her. She starts talking about her friend and her had raised Jake and Dwight. She did not understand why their mom left them. I get angry and touchy. I say in righteous haughtier, do you mean me? The mother of Jake and Dwight? You don't understand why I had to leave them? She looks at me with disgust. I don't see why you left them to be raised by others. I indignantly show her my hands. I had severe RA. I say. Probably faking it, she sniffed. Then she sees my hands and looks startled. Now she believes me. I get up and stalk off angry. I am back at the music bar. A man comes in to tell me the names of the 2 plumbers who will work my job. Scott D. someone and another man. I recognize them as Saturday Market people. I feel very rushed into this and unsure they will be fair, honest or dependable.
