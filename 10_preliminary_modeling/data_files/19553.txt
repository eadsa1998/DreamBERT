There is a large, flat field or pasture. Grass is fairly short. Left side of field is plowed. In the foreground are 2 hills between which one sees a glimpse of the ocean. The filed is 6 or 7 feet above level of ocean, and drops steeply to a very narrow sand and gravel beach at water's edge. Several robins (4 or 5) are unsuccessfully searching for worms. Although there is a fine rain or drizzle falling, the birds, which evidently are very hungry, refuse to seek shelter; though by constant fluffing of their feathers it is plain that they are not enjoying the weather. One of them runs directly past the nose of another, whereupon they all start running toward the plowed filed where worms should be easier to find. The water in the ocean is very shallow for some distance out (only inches deep) and I am tempted to climb down to the narrow beach on which I notice several foot prints (shoe prints). One of the robins lights in the water 15 or 20 feet from shore and pecks at something it sees beneath the surface and hops along on top of the water toward land. It is this frog that the robin was after.
