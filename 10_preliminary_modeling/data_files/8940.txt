I was sitting at my pc in my home office eating a muffin and I had a full glass of milk sitting to my right. I had taken the paper off of the muffin but the muffin was still sitting in the middle of it. I was breaking pieces off with my fingers and eating it that way. Something happened that caused the milk to fall off of the computer stand. It tipped over completely horizontal. I grabbed it before it hit the floor. Even though it went completely horizontal none of the milk spilled.
