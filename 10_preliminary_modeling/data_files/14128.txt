I was watching a boxing match with Ezra. It was a girl vs guy. The girl got the guy down and he ended up dying. His name was like Michael Spinocolli or something. I thought he was a race car driver for some reason. Later I was reading about him and his name was actually Ben McCallum. Later I was with Mom driving and I realized it was Ben from Big Brother, but his name was Brett, sometimes Brendan. I realized when it said he was from Midvale. I was telling Mom and she was in shock too. His profile picture was of a black-ish guy.
