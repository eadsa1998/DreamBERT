Steve's family was real backwoods hicks. His little sisters rolled in the mud. They were between 3 and 7 years old. We were standing, leaning on al wall. Rudy thought about going to graduate school but he hated school. Rudy made a philosophical comment about a living room and a busy highway and people were the cars. I liked Steve. I accidentally stepped on kitty's tail and then laid down in the grass next to the road and played with her. The office gave me a newspaper. They had office space. They had a baby chair, snack tray, and door prize items. I distinctly heard Dora call my name "Merri"
