At the Book Cafe: Father Andrew and Marissa Camden are tending the store until I can take over; then they go out the back door. Just then someone comes in who wants to talk with Father Andrew; I run out to see a blue Cadillac with a yellow "C," for "clergy" on the license plate, turn the corner. I return to say that he has left and will be back Monday.
