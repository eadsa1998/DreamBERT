I'm a male, someone in a Gothic tale. I must assemble Bono of U2 or Sting. I'm in a medieval castle with other people. For some reason, these people decide to make a game out of beating and torturing me. I believe I'm killed, but I see that once they're done with me, they want to play the "game" with some poor blond serving girl. They also beat her to within an inch of her life. Next fragment: I am leaving the city with my friend Nan and hook up with Madonna and Rosie O'Donnell. We're headed to Chicago. I've never been so thrilled. I tell them I really want to move to Chicago. Once there (Madonna no longer with us), we go to EDD office. I'm carrying a dresser and have to guard it so it doesn't get stolen. I almost miss my appointment. Meanwhile, Nan and Rosie are trying out for a women's baseball team. It's exciting but they don't get in. Three other girls do. They are small and brown (ethnic) in Catholic school uniforms. We need to get "home." We're staying at someone's apartment. On the way home, I have to cling to the back of the car -- some old little vehicle -- and on the way am chased by a black dog. I think the dog wants to hurt me, but it just wants to play. We get to the house and I leave my dresser outside in the doorway. (Dog stays out too.) Inside, the girls are playing. The game consists of warding off attacks with a small glass table top. The attacks are with tomatoes or soft foods but when I get the glass, I chip it. We try to put it back where we found it so no one can tell.
