       "men coming in taking over - sinister" [Don't know how many, but several, in suits like Forties gangsters - they just sort of walked into the house quietly and took over, I don't know what for - there's been no violence or overt threats, but I know they're up to no good. They're waiting for something, maybe for somebody else to come.] "milk out of refrigerator - didn't know there, put back in, they'd bought more, lots to drink, offer to men - old dinette in corner of little kitchen" [I'm in the kitchen, it's a tiny one, with a little dinette set with red flowered plastic upholstery all the way in the corner up against the windows, there are several, bright sunshine, yard outside, corner is in the front of the house, looks out on the street. Near the dinette set is a small refrigerator and some boxes, or wood cartons like Coke boxes. I'm right there and spot the milk behind some of the boxes, not hidden but accidentally left out of sight. I go to put it back in the refrigerator and find somebody's bought more in the meantime and it'll be ded if I put this in - since there's so much I figure we might as well drink it and I offer it to the men.
