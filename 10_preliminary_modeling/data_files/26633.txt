 I'm at a large gathering where some people speak. Several dumb women speak. They are the stereotypical type airhead blond women. Some of these dumb women get voted out by means of a color match of a blue beanbag and some blue body of water. We write about our suggestions for improvements in the way things are run. I write messily that my suggestion is to incorporate dreams into _____ (I forgot, but it means the way things are run. It may be the lectures). My aunt Sheila Redding seems to be there. A dog, which I may pet, is there.
