My mother, father and fiancee went with me on a fishing trip. We stayed at a very old house somewhere in Kentucky. The house was half over water and was owned by hicks. We went fishing by tying strings around our finger and used pickles as bait. I caught a large catfish. The hicks told us the fishing was good because they made pickles and stored them in their basement which was in the water. The fish were attracted by the smell or flavor of the pickles and always stayed near the house.
