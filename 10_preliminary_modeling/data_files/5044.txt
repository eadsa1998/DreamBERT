My mother tells me that Aunt Muriel died. I am surprised because I had just written to her because I'd dreamed about her last week. I started looking for the dream book to show my mother what I'd written. I can't find it. I pick up a child's schoolbook and read it until I realize it's not the dream book. I had been packing to go visit my mother and I find the dream book. I open it to a dream where a beautifully drawn picture is on the page and the dream was written over it. I am very impressed. I had no idea I was capable of such excellent drawing skills. It is a vague cousin V, her husband and their baby. [BL]
