       Another scene: a man is encouraging me to try clothes on, so I can go to some fancy ball or do. I have got absolutely nothing to wear for it, and I absolutely refuse to consider going in the things he's proposing. I will not - as he suggests - put on these 2 old-fashioned, granny-type long-sleeved cotton dresses and "somehow" combine them.
