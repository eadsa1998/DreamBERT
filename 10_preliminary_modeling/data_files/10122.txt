Frank and I are on a huge SHIP: I see the blue water and the mountains. The ship drifts to a high embankment near a town and we can walk out the side of the ship directly into a house that is like a tavern. We go into the house and a young woman holds a BABY that I had been taking care of. We talk like old friends and she tells me that I did a good job of taking care of the baby. She also says she cannot always understand me. I say: "That is because I grew up in a different culture."
