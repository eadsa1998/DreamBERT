These people from Heroes, who weren't people we knew, and they were real, went to this place. The people inside wanted to kill them and one of the 'leaders' said to hide behind this thing. Some thought the people would help them and stayed in their seats. Someone put a field around the ones hiding. This guy came out and saw the people. They were in this teleporter thing in a different dimension and could only wander. He killed them and they were stuck in the dimension forever.
