I am asleep in the same bed with Bonnie at 3:00 a.m. Mateo comes in and wakes me. "I want to take a bath," he says. I tell him it's 3 a.m. I get up, get my doctor's bag and go to another cabin. We are on a cruise ship. A man and a woman are sharing a cabin. They aren't supposed to, but everyone just looks the other way. He has bumps all over him and I tell him he has the mumps or maybe the measles and he can't continue the trip. It'll take three weeks to heal up.
