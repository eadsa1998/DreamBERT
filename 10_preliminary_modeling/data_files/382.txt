I'm at my Mom's, and she's got some shampoo that you don't have to use with water - it's a liquid gel, and you spread it on your hair with your hands, then you have to wipe them on something - and she says this is a good thing to do to keep the cats clean - you just wipe your hands on them. We're in the living room, they're sitting in chairs (like the real ones, but the whole room is a little different) - it's night and the lamps are on, yellow light.
