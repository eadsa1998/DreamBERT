I decide to go visit Ellie. It's only a few blocks away. I walk over to her apartment. The door sill is up about 4 feet. I wonder how I'm going to get in. Andy helps me in. Ellie is very busy in and out of the room and I sigh because I shall have to spend time with Andy as he is holding the baby. I'd feel more comfortable with Ellie, but can't get her to slow down enough to take the time. I decide Andy is o.k. I play with the baby. Ellie comes by with another baby she is babysitting. Something is very wrong with his eyes. One is larger and strangely formed. He even has eyeballs in his mouth. His name is Chris. A woman drops by to arrange a time with Ellie to watch her baby. They leave. I look at Andy, who now is all brown with black hair and blue eyes. He tells me he is a Maui from Hawaii. I ask, "What percentage?" He says, "100%." I notice that I am prejudiced and try not to be. I then think, with some regret, that their child will only be half white. I then shrug my shoulder and try not to let that matter.
