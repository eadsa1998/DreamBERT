My family and my boyfriend Jeremy and I were at a carnival of some sort.  We played a game in an arena with a shallow pool and some rooms nearby.  We were each given several identical stuffed beanie animals and..pencils?  The stuffed animals were ammo and each person had a different animal to identify them.  Someone had frogs, another was something white, perhaps sheep.  There were small disks, too.  The pencil was used to fling the items at others.  The disks would 'stun' the victim and the stuffed animals were actual shots that would yield points.  A person didn't have to leave the field when hit; winner was determined solely by points.  Each person only had three or four stuffed animals to shoot before having to go pick them up again, so there was a strategy to shooting the disks before the stuffed animals.  I really got into the game, much more so than paintball I thought- probably because there wasn't any pain in getting hit.  I shot off a few at my brother Stuart, and got my mother into the game.  I went off to the left room where my father and Jeremy were in the middle of a battle.  There were some bright flashes in the room related to the game somehow.
