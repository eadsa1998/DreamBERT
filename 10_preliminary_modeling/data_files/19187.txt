There was this turtle food, but I can't remember the dream. Turtle food. But I can't remember what it was called. Why. There was this large pen full of turtles. You could see them moving their arms and legs back and forth. Some of the turtles, well, you couldn't see them all because they were right side up, but some of them were upside down. The ones that were upside down had these large holes drilled in the area of their sternum and you could see their little hearts were pumping. I was going to get some turtle food for these turtles. They were making swimming-like motions, but they weren't in any water. They were just all on top of each other. Sam felt he had to go get the food for the turtles because they couldn't get out and get it for themselves.
