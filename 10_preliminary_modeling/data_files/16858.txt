The details of this dream have faded. The only image I have left is of some kind of control panel, made up of instruments and screens, set into wood. It is retro, tactile and beautifully made, but old and battered and very complicated. It looks as though it has been altered several times over the years. I can't remember what its for - i just remember being confused.
