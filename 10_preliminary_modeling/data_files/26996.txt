I dreamt I was standing on a corner attempting to cross a busy street. The light was against me, so I had to wait on a curb. There was something pressing me as though I had to hurry and get across for fear I wouldn't be able to make it across. I was in a hurry to get some place, but I awoke before I found out my destination.
