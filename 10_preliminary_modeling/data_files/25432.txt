 I'm in my room at home. My friend Niles Zelling and I are going to watch a pornographic movie. Tim Zelling is also there, and he wants to have sex with his girlfriend. I tell him to go to the basement. There are four "bad" guys there. Among them are my friend Norman Noman and the toothless, Nazi-like guy I see on campus. I am with the man who has visions from the television show Millennium, and two women. We are in a car. The four bad guys come and get one of the women, who is young. They have already taken this woman once. They pull her out of the back drivers-side seat of the car. The Millennium man gets out of the car. He has a sledgehammer and a log. Norman has a log, and he throws it at our car. The Millennium man beats up the four bad guys: he kicks their asses!
