Last night I had a dream that I was a work supervisor who was in charge of hiring job personnel. I sat in a large chair that looked like a throne. My desk was pretty big also, and it was made of a certain kind of dark metal (maybe iron?). As I sat in my seat, I interviewed the first person. His face wasn't at all familiar, but I noticed something strange. His head and face were normal, but his body was shaped like a boxcar. He came in as if he were driving a car (his feet were like wheels). At least a couple of more people came in for job interviews, but their bodies were also shaped like boxcars. As I asked job relevant questions they all laughed. At one point, they all came in at the same time and didn't listen to anything I said. They still laughed and laughed. It was mayhem.
