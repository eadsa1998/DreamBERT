I'm going over the hill to the community college on a racing bike. It's hard but I'm doing it, going up hill. Kids Paulina's age are pulling out, but I keep going on. A guy wants to use my repair kit. I'm willing, but don't know how. He gets mad at me. I tell him I have arthritis and this isn't my equipment. He gives up the race and goes back. I go on. Now I'm going down hill fast, curves, almost too fast, barely control the bike, now going up hill. I hear a male sleazy biker friend deciding to lay out his bed on the trail. I yell, "Get him off the trail or I'll run over him." I grab cigs on my way by, but they won't light or fall apart. The guys laugh because there was marijuana in one. It falls apart. I go on and against great odds I win! Exhausted but happy.
