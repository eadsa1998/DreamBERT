 Some immigrants that seem almost like slaves arrive at a place off a boat or plane or some transportation. There is an old wooden building there that is creaky and dank. Dirt sacks must be hauled. There is a male who shirks this job of hauling sacks until the sacks are nearly gone, and then he hauls the last one. Food is rationed and is sparse.
