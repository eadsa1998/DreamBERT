I had a very brief dream of Mary. It was just a short, one-scene flash. Mary is wearing a long, mostly red floral gown. It looks like a caftan. She is facing me. I cannot see her face clearly. My eyes first take in her hair. It is in the upswept style she is fond of, in which her long hair is rolled around a "rat" at the back of her head. It gives fullness and body to her hairdo. Then I catch a brief glimpse of her eyes. She appears to be disguised as a Japanese woman (a Geisha Girl?).
