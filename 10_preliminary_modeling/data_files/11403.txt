There was a very large military cemetery. A priest was standing in the middle of the cemetery. There were hundreds of people along a fence that enclosed the cemetery. They were all serious but no one was crying. As I watched these people I thought of Carrie in Dreisek's Sister Carrie. I can't remember now what I was thinking about Carrie except that her name kept running through my mind. The dream finally faded away. During the night I had several other dreams and I was conscious of the fact that I had to remember them but I can only recall the one.
