I was at school and my stepmother drove up and had her little boy come in to tell me it was time to go. He was drooling. When I went out to the car, there wasn't enough room for me to ride too and I got mad because they expected me to take a bus (they didn't know I was pregnant). My stepmother wanted me to try some new kind of birth control. They were little tablets you hold in your mouth and you had to put about 200 in there. Then it was to be inserted in your womb. I put the stuff in my mouth and the tablets broke open and there was ink inside. I thought maybe it might be poison and might cause an abortion and I was upset.
