Ezra and I were out the back somewhere. We needed to go through this cage thing but there were dogs in it. One of them had red eyes and kept growling. I leapt onto this cement block and Ezra got onto this ledge that was attached to the fence (wire fence around the back). A dog got out and tried to attack us. Ezra slid along to the other fence to where I was. We kept going back and forth, putting legs up so the dog couldn't reach us. We managed to get to where we needed to be. Then I was watching Big Brother UK. I recognized the house, but it was sort of different. I got to the Cat Haven and then decided I didn't want to do it anymore. I called Mom to get me.
