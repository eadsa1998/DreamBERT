["Split Performance and crazy comedian"]  I am walking with several members of my performance troupe. We are going to the performance area. Mary Ann is in a manic phase and is wildly talking about how she's going to go out there during the performance and tell dirty jokes. She is harassing me by calling out Knock Knock. Meaning what will follow will be a dirty joke. I try to ignore her. I decide to split off from the main group and do a performance on the other end of this huge area. I walk a long distance. I find some people I know. I am smoking Marlboro cigarettes. I only have three left. A man who is attracted to me is near by. He is helping me get more cigarettes. I decide I must go back and try to stop Mary Ann from making a fool of us all. I walk back. She is now in a normal phase and I talk with her. She will be fine.
