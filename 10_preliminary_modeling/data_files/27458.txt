I dreamed that some of my friends and I were buying lunch at an out-door cafeteria. However, the cafeteria was out-of-doors wherein each person picked whatever he wanted directly from the ground where it was growing. As I was passing down the line, didn't find very many items of food which suited me, because, for some reason or other they seemed too fancy or too cumbersome. When I reached the cashier I found that fifty cents was the minimum, and since my lunch was much less than this, I bought several chances on a bicycle that was being raffled.
