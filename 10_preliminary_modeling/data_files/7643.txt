I was in CHV. Barry C wasn't around but Patty U was. She was in a rage. verbally, and physically trying to track me down. I was feeling very scared. We were both in our cars. I thought I saw her several streets away but I had a sense that she either didn't see me or didn't know who I was. She was in a rust-colored SUV. The next thing I know Barry C was back from Henry's and we are in Patty U's house. not her waking life house. I told him she was trying to find me. She didn't want to physically hurt me but rather hurt me with verbal outrage, confrontation, and questions. I was trying to find ways to quickly escape if I needed to. There was a row of windows with miniblinds on them. They were all locked. I finally found one that wasn't locked. Barry C and I opened it partially so if I needed to I could quickly open it the rest of the way and escape. We went outdoors and discussed my staying out there. For some reason we talked about my answering the phone but decided that was too risky. I finally decided to drive into town, rent a room, and then try to find the University to use a phone and to walk.
