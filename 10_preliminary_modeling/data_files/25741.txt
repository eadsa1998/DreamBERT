 There are two boys rollerblading. I'm at home. I do a fake rail slide on my back steps. My mom comes outside. I tell her I'm going to the store to get stuff for an Astronomy presentation. I walk away as I talk to her. I'm trying to by sly, and make my mom accept my statement without questioning me. I'm really not going to the store, and if I am it is not important. I am with two women that seem like play things. They are very flirtatious and giggly and stupid.
