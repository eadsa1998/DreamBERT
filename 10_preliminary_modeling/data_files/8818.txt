I was with mother and daddy and one of my sisters at my parent's house. He was explaining to me and my sister that we were going to have to take care of mother. I don't know if this was a one-time thing, or if he was preparing us to take care of her, should he be the one to die before her. This obviously made me and my sister very uncomfortable, the idea of having to take care of her colostomy. She was laying in her bed, on her back, completely undressed, and covered with a blanket. He was explaining how we would have to turn her over to her side. Before he started showing us how to take care of her colostomy, she got up and walked away. I was surprised that it didn't bother her to get out of bed completely unclothed in front of myself and my sister.
