 I'm in a big house with my girlfriend's mother, Tamara Thomas, and another woman who is older. I'm taking a table and small rug downstairs. I get the feeling that someone has just died. I know that dead person isn't on the side of the family that Tamara, I, and the old woman are there for. Tamara asks us if we want to have a drink of pop or juice or something, to talk. I want to and say yes. I bring the table and rug downstairs and put them away. I try to open the door, but it is the wrong one. Tamara tells me, "The one straight ahead." I had tried to open the door on the right. She stopped and corrected me. I put the stuff down. ON the walls there are clues. The clues are on small white cards. There are a few words on each card describing something. One can win a dead turkey, an alive dog, or 70 chicken strips as some of the prizes. One of my sister's friends from grade school Jaime, is doing well getting the clues. I am not.
