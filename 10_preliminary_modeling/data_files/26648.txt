 I'm at Brimson near the student union. I see my sister Ramona approaching. She is a first-year student at Brimson. She walks over to me; we're going to talk. She has a photograph of herself: an eight by ten or a ten by twelve, of her in a red sweater when she was younger. We're near the top of the north steps on the west side of the building. A woman is Ramona's first-year class comes out of the student union and starts walking up the steps to go by us. She has long hair that looks like it's dyed black. Ramona says, "Hi Kari" to her as she passes. The woman kind of says a snotty hi, but she essentially ignores Ramona. Ramona starts to raise her photo for the woman to see, saying, "Do you want to see..." The woman continues walking away, ignoring her. I think this woman is not a very nice person: is conceited. Ramona is being very friendly: making an effort to get to know people. I think if Ramona keeps doing this she'll meet some good people. I'm going to talk to Ramona about financial aid, since I've been through the process.
