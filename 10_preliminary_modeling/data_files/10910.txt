I dreamed that a plague had descended upon a city. The people who were affected had their faces, limbs, and other parts of the body horribly distorted. It was necessary to shut these people up in vaults. I thought that this was an unmerciful thing to do, but nobody would pay any attention. Soon I realized that my cheek was becoming hard and knew I had the disease and would have to be shut up. My leg also became hard in one spot. The people said that I would have to be shut up, but they would try to put me in a nice vault. I felt resigned, but didn't want to be so distorted. The inside of the vault wasn't too bad, and I sat and waited until I became as sick as the other people there, but somehow I wasn't afraid.
