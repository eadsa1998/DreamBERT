 I'm at Brimson College at a ballroom dance to which I was not invited. I am upstairs. My dad is down stairs in the ballroom. The dance is for people who have a 4.0 grade point average, and there are a lot of people there. My dad says something about his son having a 4.0 grade point average. I am upstairs looking through folders trying to find my class schedule. Time is running out, and I need the schedule. People are handing me applications. I see my friend Gino Teavor. He asks me if he can cash a check, if I have a checkbook, and if there is a Metropolis bank in St. Paul. I see my friend and teammate Simon Naver, who tells me that Grant Lee Buffalo is the opening band for Smashing Pumpkins. My friend Binky Ahmed is there too.
