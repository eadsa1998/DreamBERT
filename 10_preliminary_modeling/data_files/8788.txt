It was early on Sunday morning. I went to Kroger to pick up three things, tangerines, a head of lettuce and a box of thank you notes. As I walked in the door I couldn't believe how packed the store was for that early on a Sunday morning. I couldn't figure out why. You could barely get in the door for all of the shopping carts sitting ready for use. Beyond that the store was as crowded as you would see on Christmas Eve. I took a cart and proceeded. As I got inside the door I debated what my quickest strategy would be. Should I go for the cards first and then produce or the other way around? I was standing right by the lettuce so I got the head lettuce and then decided to get the thank you cards. It was hard to maneuver because there were so many people, and with shopping carts too it just felt like madness to me. I laid my white handbag in the child seat of the cart. It didn't have shoulder straps on it. I had something brown, like a brown folded bag, lying on top of it, though I don't know why. It was still easy to see the handbag. I walked away from my cart to get the thank you notes. They were on the top shelf. I had to step on something and really reach to get them. There were people everywhere and I was afraid I might bump into someone as I reached or hit someone with my arm or elbow as I came back to the floor. I kept looking both ways as I lowered myself back to the floor. I had the head of lettuce in my hands also. I just wanted to get out of there so I quickly turned and headed back to the produce section to get the tangerines. Just as I got over there I realized I had left my shopping cart sit in the other aisle, and my handbag was still in it. I panicked and practically ran back to that aisle hoping it would still be there. When I first got there I got very upset because I didn't see it. I looked in some other aisles and found it. I was very relieved and realized that I had just looked in the wrong aisle initially.
