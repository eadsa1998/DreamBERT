I see my little boy baby, he's maybe a 1 and a half years old. He's been playing with some people. He comes over to me and crawls into my arms. I hold him and hug him. My daughter Paulina is there also, and she is a young girl. It feels good to have them there with me. He needs lots of attention and loving. Then I am in a passenger side of a car and Paulina and her husband Lance are in the back. We're going to the coast for a vacation. Suddenly Lance is washing my hair. I am startled and say, "You'll get my clothes wet." Then I remember I had forgotten to pack my clothes and pills. I was so busy attending to the children I forgot to pack for myself. I am a bit embarrassed. I don't want Lance and Paulina to be embarrassed and concerned that they will be traveling with a person in a suit of sweats that are wet from the hair washing. I get the feeling that Lance washed my hair to sort of force me gently into changing my sloppy attire so they won't be embarrassed by my appearance. I assure them I can stop off at a store and buy a couple of outfits. "We can go to Goodwill," I say, thinking of saving money. I remember I can go to a pharmacist and get a few pills to tide me over.
