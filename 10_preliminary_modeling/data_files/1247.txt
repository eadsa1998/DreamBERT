My parents and I are returning. We have a school bus, my van, and a boat on a trailer. We arrange that my parents will relief drive for me. I'm tired. However, first we have to stop off at the hospital for my mother to have surgery. I finally realize I'll have to drive all the way. She can't have surgery and then drive away. We go to find her room. We are lost. Then I see some guy wearing a funny mask like a round plastic head with a smiling clown face. I think it's funny to ask him where the room is.
