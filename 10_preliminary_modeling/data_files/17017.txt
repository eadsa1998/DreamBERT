I'm staying in a large hotel on or near high mountains. It could be in the Alps - Austria maybe. The building looks like a log cabin in style on the exterior like a ski resort. I'm there with my partner and my eldest daughter. The accommodation is on the cheap side - like a hostel. I return after being out somewhere and I can find my family anywhere. I go into a large canteen to ask if anyone has seen them. there are several people in the canteen that I recognize as being with our group.
