["Moving."] I am in a garage of a house I live in. It is time to start packing for the move. I start looking at piles of papers on a long counter along the side wall. I find notes from several women who had attended a woman's group at my house. I feel good I can throw some things away. A black man apparently my "husband" comes home from some fun male event. He seems friendly and helpful. I feel relieved he's in a good mood.
