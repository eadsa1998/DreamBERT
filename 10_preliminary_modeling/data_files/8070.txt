I was at the office with Bill C. He asked me if I wanted to go to lunch and discuss things. I said, sure. He headed out the door, but I went into my office to get my suit jacket. He turned around and saw I wasn't behind him. He asked if I was coming. I said yes. I had something very large in my hand but I don't know what it was. I put my jacket on and headed out the door. I'm now at a post office. I see a man named Scott. I knew him but don't know who it is in waking life. He's a new member of CRHP XII. We were exchanging pleasantries, etc. Helen J comes in. I act very excited to see her. I approach her, give her a hug, we chat. I turned around and said, Oh, have you met Scott? She said she had not. I told her that he is our newest CRHP XII member. I introduced them. They were now chatting and a couple more of my CRHP sisters came in. I jokingly asked if someone had made arrangements for CRHP to meet at the post office. Anne C was one of the ones who had just come in. I don't know who the others were. I gave her a hug and chatted with her a bit. She looked different than she does in waking life.
