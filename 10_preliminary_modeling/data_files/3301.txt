Jock says to me he just now heard that he wasn't being paid for his work on a play. I say, "What a gyp." Another man says, "It's not really a problem, because all we have to do is fill out this form and take it to the office and they'll come up with the money." I decide to do this and try to fill it out. Now I'm walking to take the form to the office and I'm walking on a "carpet" of sticks and twigs and hollow cork bark and pussy willows which have been sorted carefully so each kind of thing is all in a row. I pick up a cork bark still in the shape of a branch and admire its beauty. I admire the work that went into laying all the pussy willows out together in a row.
