["Reading my class notes, not quite prepared."] I am in a journalism class, hurriedly looking through my notes for the kinds of examples my teacher is calling for. As students are reading their notes to the class, I hurriedly try to find some I made. I feel unprepared. The teacher is seated in a student desk just in front of me. He says sarcastically, Guess you're trying to write some on the spot. I say defensively no, just circling some examples. I go to the front of the class and pick up the microphone off its odd round stainless steel holder. It is heavy metal. A woman student says no, leave it in the stand. I say then can people hear me? I then notice how loud my voice is and say I guess t works. She gets up and sings a song with the mike to test it. I wait for her to finish the entire song. Now I start reading snippets of my notes. The teacher wants personal remarks about the facts we were getting about a story. So I read a few phrases I wrote about a story the teacher used as an example about a person with a disability and how the problem is people getting all weirded out about their disability. I comment it is hard to counsel disabled people who are treated that way. Then I say next is some doodled pictures of dishes, like they are stacked up to be washed. Stainless steel mixing bowls and colored plastic small bowls. I say I don't know why I doodled dishes, but sometimes when I am thinking, I doodle. Then a remark about my father and I doing some activity. A few notes on Mirabelle and working with clients. She has some names and phone numbers for me. The teacher is impressed as I go along. I had lots, even though I wasn't prepared and my stuff is a bit poetic and interesting, not like the shallow stuff the younger students are doing.
