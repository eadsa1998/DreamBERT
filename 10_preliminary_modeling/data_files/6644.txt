On camping party. Cots laid out at right angles. They are of dark khaki color. A canvas flap is between each pair and sheep's wool padding on the cots. Explain the advantage of the flap to R. and the others. Return and find the cots all cleared away. At table waiting to be served. Tell R. there are no more plates to pass. She leaves table. I go bring more plates. Irritated at R's leaving. Go to toilet. Pass through kitchen finished in blue to reach small white room.
