A young woman didn't get her money back right away and she's crying and won't listen to reason. Bonnie and I send her on her way, laughing at her gently. I find a sticker to put on the spine of a book and have some difficulty getting it to stay stuck. Bonnie has found some food she really loves. It is like a spread to put on crackers. Two ingredients are put together. She says, "It is so delicious." She just can't wait to taste it again. She is quite excited. "Try it," she says. I see a platter with graham crackers and saltine spread with a thin layer of stuff. I choose the saltine, cause it doesn't have sugar. "Hum," I say, "It does taste good." I'm not as thrilled as Bonnie. Now I'm going into a house to take the baby to visit Grandma. A nice man is there. He dives into a pool of water to adjust the pipes. He is very helpful. It's time to leave. He'd like me to stay and visit. I take the baby to Grandma to say goodbye for awhile.
