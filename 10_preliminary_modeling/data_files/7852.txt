I had a dream group meeting. There were nine people there. Louise H, Sophia K, Dan M, Lou S, the others I don't remember. Mark M was not there. I was getting very sleepy towards the end of the meeting. Our discussion got way off track. I said something about this being a very interesting conversation. It could go on for hours, especially when you talk about multiple personalities and the fact that if they have MP do they also have multiple souls and multiple spirits or some combination. I was having a very hard time keeping my eyes open while I was saying that. After the meeting was over I thought everyone was gone and I went to pick up the money. I thought there would be $90 but there was only $3. I was very upset and realized I didn't say anything about them leaving their money before they left so it was my fault. Still, I was disappointed that not even Lou S, Dan M and Sophia K left their money. Surely if they had left theirs, the others would have done likewise, and those three know the routine by now. Still, it was my fault. Matthew was helping me put the chairs away. There were two little yellow rocking chairs, like I have in waking life, and one adult size, like them. I said I don't even know where the extra two came from. He asked me where the one blue chair went and then two or three people came out of the kitchen. One was a very dark-skinned woman from India who had her hair and face completely covered. I asked if she had paid yet and got the sense that there was going to be some kind of problem.
