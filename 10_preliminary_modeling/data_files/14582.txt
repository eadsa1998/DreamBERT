I can't remember properly, but David Tennant as the Doctor (Doctor Who) was in the past when there was no electricity, etc. There was a monster and it was coming and he discovered a way to teleport this building with these gems. He managed to do it at the last second. In the new place, this lady had gotten squashed by the monster as it was moving and so was now dead. There was more but I can't remember it now.
