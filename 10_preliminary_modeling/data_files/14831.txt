I was at Brookland to finish off this course to graduate. I was in uniform and I didn't know where to go. It was then a movie? This guy was being chased. He hid behind a wall and then I was there too. The wall was next to a path and behind it was this tower thing and then a field. I had a gun. This control box on the wall was screwed and I shot it so it wouldn't explode. I saw a bad guy and shot at him. Then the guy I was with and another guy were lying together almost naked. The other guy was asleep. I said to "lick his face". He went to (as a joke) but then he turned. When the guy woke up he kissed him and they were like 'uh... ok' and then he thought that he might like him.
