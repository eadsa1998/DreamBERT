I was with a group of people. We were presenting some kind of a show or contest. I was going to be one of the announcers. When people came in and got settled I was going to first of all helping them to fill out their entry forms. for lack of a better word. I don't know what it was. I had some 3 x 5 cards. It would say something like, #1 and what it was. Then I would tell them what they should be filling in there. Like, a lot of them were just general what they should be filling in but some were very specific. So on some of them I was telling them a specific name to check or fill in. One of the items I didn't know what it was. It was a very strange word. It sounded something like, Imagonnagohome! So I was standing on this stage with a microphone. I was joking about it. When I first got started, the microphone that I was supposed to use wasn't working. Then I was supposed to be standing in front of the stage using this microphone. That microphone wasn't working so they brought me around and up on stage and gave me a different microphone. I was using that one and we were still having problems. I was making jokes to try to make light of the technical problems we were having. It was mostly men that I was working with. It seemed that I was observing these children of this wealthy man. He didn't have time for his children, so they were not well behaved. They were spoiled because he spent lots of money on them instead of spending time with them. They were going to play bride and groom. The young girl, she was very large and well developed for her age, was half-dresses in her wedding outfit. She kept yelling at the little boy to bring her dress. He wouldn't do it. Then I'm back at the event. I was going to lay down and watch the rest of it. This little girl is upset so she asks if she can lay there with me. I told her that she could. She or I one grab a pillow. She was going to come over and lay there with me to watch this event or program.
