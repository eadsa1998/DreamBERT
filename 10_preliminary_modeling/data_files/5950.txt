Am in the UN building and I see an inside window display or type of showcase in which there is a card saying something about an exhibit on mankind. Focal point is a tall male mannequin or store dummy dressed in mod clothes: tight gray trousers and shiny long leather boots. The model is exact copy of myself and I realize this was done on purpose. Sort of growing out of one part of the dummy is another head, closely resembling me also. But it is decidedly a feminine head. Exhibit includes statuary of some modern shape, plus photos that I cannot distinguish. A woman approaches me as I am looking at exhibit. She is somewhat mannish, but otherwise attractive, and she says she is Mme. Onantis, the photographer of the exhibit. (It's a name I have never heard before.) I tell her how much I like her work and then we walk out of building. Altho sun is shining, it suddenly rains and we decide to wait under the sheltered doorway.(172 words)</span
