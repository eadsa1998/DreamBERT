I dreamed this dream the night before my friend Tia Sticapoulou went to New York. I dreamed I saw her walking down the street with another of my friends on the day that she was to leave. I inquired as to what had happened. She replied that she waited for a number of hours and that the person didn't come that was to take her. She was weeping bitterly. Seeing that I have no other connection with Tia other than knowing her in the dorm, I associate her with Bellflower House on Bellflower Road. However, the setting of this dream was on the street where I once lived here in Cleveland. I could see very clearly my old home with the bakery next door and the high cyclone fence around it. I even saw some of the houses and familiar faces that I once knew. Tia is a very good friend of mine who lives in the dorm. She is older than I am and is 23 years old. The girl that she was with is also a girl from the dorm who is nineteen years old. This girl, Maryanne Adams had no active part in the dream other than being with Tia.
