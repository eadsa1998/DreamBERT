I dreamt that I had entered a town which had just been taken over by a gang of criminals. Business was going on as usual, but everywhere there were people walking around with machine guns, etc. on their arms. I remember that I went to the barber shop to get a haircut. As I went in I noticed a man out in front who was collecting money, taxes or something of the sort. Everyone who came up to him paid him in coin and called him sir. The man's appearance (personal) was very obscure. I sat down, was conscious of someone alongside of me but couldn't tell who it was. As I was sitting there, a man came in the shop and looked in my direction. He said, "I thought I saw a couple of faces back there." As he came back to me I couldn't make out anything about him because of the haze. He put both hands on my face and said, "You have a professional face." Then his hands started towards my neck and I had the feeling that he was going to choke me. I took hold of both of his wrists and pushed him away.
