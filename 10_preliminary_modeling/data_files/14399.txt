I was playing with a small Shiba Inu and I was calling it Charlie. Dmitri had a dog and I was actually playing with an imaginary dog. I said I was practicing. His dog was a Chow Chow, but it didn't look like one. I said the Shiba's come from the same place as the Chow Chow's, but his was from somewhere else.
