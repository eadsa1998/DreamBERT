A young male friend asked me did I have anything to do that afternoon. My watch said 2:35 and I said no. Then I thought harder and remembered I had (not a class) an exam in a peculiar kind of scientific German course in advanced grammar. Yet I had not attended class since spring vacation, nor had I studied. I needed the credits for graduation and couldn't figure out why no one had reminded me of this class which I had forgotten. I tried to cram for a few desperate moments, not knowing what to do.
