We got into my home in my hometown for some reason, and I found that there were several parties that were being given by various people with whom I graduated. It seems to be either a graduation party or a homecoming party or something on this order, and I was going to go to several of them. It seemed that somebody sent me some flowers. I don't remember what kind. I took them out of the box they were in, and I put several pieces of jewelry into this box to send to somebody, probably not the same person. I don't believe it was really my idea. A lot of the jewelry was very fancy and lovely--cut stones of deep, sparkling blue-green color. There were bracelets, earrings, pins, and I don't know exactly what. Then there were several pieces of plain jewelry --gold clips or something on this order--and it was sort of a test for the person to whom it was sent. They were supposed to pick out the plain jewelry. At about this time I started wondering what I was going to wear to these parties because I hadn't expected to go to any parties when we came down and I hadn't brought anything suitable with me.
