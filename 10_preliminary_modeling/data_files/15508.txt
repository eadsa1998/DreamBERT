This fat girl called Katie somehow pressured me into taking her to Nana's with us. She disappeared and I realised she took my car and bought something with my debit card, and said she'd give it back. After finding her name, I tried calling her and she hung up. I was worried and angry and Dad said 'you're the one that brought her here'.
