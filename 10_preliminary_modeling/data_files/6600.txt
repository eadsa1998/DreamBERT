Standing on white lanai, see Mrs. G. and Mrs. Q. plodding through snow. Call to them, "I am being entertained at this beautiful place." Mrs. G. waves large letter saying, "I have been writing about this girl (Mrs. G.). She's catholic you know and they are incompatible." Mrs. Q. looks somewhat disturbed and sad.
