Mary and I have just returned from a trip, or are about to depart on a trip. Our dwelling is a mess, with clothes and other things strewn untidily throughout the rooms. Mary starts to tidy up, but is too tired to continue. I tell her to rest and to lie down and I'll clean everything up. She says she'll lie down, but tells me not to clean up -- that she'll do it later because it is her responsibility. I tell her not to worry -- just go and rest. She does so, going into one of the bedrooms where she lies down. Then I went about tidying up.
