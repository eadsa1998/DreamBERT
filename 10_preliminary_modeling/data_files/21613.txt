I dug out tree roots. We were cleaning up the yard of winter dirt and shrubbery. We had a new place and were doing the landscaping and some spring cleaning. I was dressed with an overcoat walking the street. Felt sort of a gentleman. We lived on 68th St. I looked at the kitchen door and a side panel of the door frame was broken off. It couldn't be locked. I saw Mrs. Kotnik bend over to wash the floor and her vagina was in open view. I had a hard-on and I pushed it against Ann.
