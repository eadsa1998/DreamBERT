 I'm with my friend Kevin Simpson in the Big Resort Area. We have two canoes: one is my uncle Rusty Redding's, and the other may be Kevin's canoe or his friend's canoe. Four people approach with a bunk-type bed: a man, a woman, a child, and our friend Bubba Hacker. From a distance I at first don't recognize Bubba, but then I do and I wonder what the hell he's doing with a huge bed in the Big Resort Area. They get closer and Bubba moves away from the people, towards us, as a way of saying that he was just joking about being with them and bringing the big bed. Kevin and I push off in Rusty's canoe. There is three inches of water in the bottom of it. I say there must be a hole in it, and I see it, bubbling, on the keel near the stern. I tell to Kevin and Bubba to put all the gear in the other canoe, and let me take the leaky canoe by myself. Kevin and I had been fishing. We all see a bald eagle. I point it out. The man, woman, and child see it too. I take two photographs of it while it is flying. I don't know if they'll turn out because the camera is moving. We are headed to the 100-rod Evergreen Lake portage. We are on the south side of Oval Island on the west end. I think of the tough paddle across open water I'll have alone in a canoe.
