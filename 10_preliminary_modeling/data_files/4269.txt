["Framed."] I am the daughter of Cary Grant or Clark Gable. He is a kind mobster. We enter a restaurant and are seated at a table right next to the enemy mobster boss and associates. I am between them and my "father." I begin talking with the enemy boss. I say there will be no trouble here. You will leave each other alone. He smiles and agrees but I feel uneasy. I don't trust him. He in fact does leave us alone and leaves the restaurant. I am relieved. Then someone comes in and says my "father" has stolen liqueur and so on. They set him up. He is framed. It looks bad.
