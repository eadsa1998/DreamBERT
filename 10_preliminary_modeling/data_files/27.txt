Lynn and Jane and I are at a LT function and they have something going on that they're upset about. Won't tell me what it is yet, but we're on our way back from the Training Room to (?) the Team Room, they're both gripy and stuck-acting. Testy. We're in a place that's bound to be a shopping mall, open space with bright lights, walkways, stairs or escalators. We get where we're going and there's other people there, one of whom is an officious little guy who is pissed off because (either Lynn or I) someone is wearing a pin or i.d. button that doesn't belong, it's much fancier than the others - I noticed it before but didn't see anything wrong with it - he takes it away and I'm wondering how it's going to get replaced with the right one. Some of the next little bit - don't know what it is, or who's talking - takes place by a small group of other people who are already in the "Team Room", and I don't know them but one turns out to be that guy from "After Hours" - Griffin Dunne, and I don't want to continue in front of him, so I move toward the "door" a bit so I'll be out of his line of vision.
