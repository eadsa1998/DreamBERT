Lee, a prominent businessman in my hometown, is dying of cancer. He is in a bleacher in his bed in a glassed in area where people can see him but no one but his family stops. I think this is bad after all he has done for the community. I want to stop but my husband won't let me. Some phrase comes to mind. Someone says it but I can't remember it when I wake up. The grandstand is by his store so he can watch people shopping.
