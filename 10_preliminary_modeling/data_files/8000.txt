I was myself as a little girl, still living at home. It was before Bill F, Brian F, or Bev was born. It wasn't my actual birth home. It seemed to be even more out in the country than where we actually lived. There was something going on with horses. Daddy and I went to this barn to check on our horse. He said something about Grandpa F's horse being there. I said, You mean Grandpa F is here? I knew Grandpa F was dead and that if he was there it was only in spirit. Daddy said, yeah, he's back there. He's sitting on the other side of his horse. One thing that was very strange about this dream was that others saw me as a little girl, I knew that I was my current age and they were just seeing me differently. I had never experienced this before.
