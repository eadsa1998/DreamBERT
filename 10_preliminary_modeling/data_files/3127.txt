I enter a classroom. It's a big room and there are only a few students, all young men and a male teacher. I sit near the door and next to the teacher. He drones on. I am annoyed and bored. The men students get real ornery and mutiny. I get up to go to the bathroom. I go in and sit. Someone comes in and tries to push open the stall door. I hold it shut and yell, "Hey, hey." It's one of the men. I wonder if I went in the wrong bathroom, but I guess the men are just rambunctious and without respect. Finally I return to the classroom. A man is in my seat. I go to him and say, "I was here before." He sneers. I get angry and righteous and say, "To hell with you then." The teacher glares at me and says, "ou can't come back in here because you were a part of the men's mischievous disruptions of class." I say to him, "To hell with you. I simply left the room to go to the bathroom at the same time they all left." He said, "You were gone one hour. I say, "I had a little problem, OK??" I am belligerent, and sassy, "and furthermore, you are boring and don't know much. If you want me to stay in the dream interpretation class, you better get good." I go to the table where the men students are seated and it's away across the huge room. A paper comes down for me to sign, the roll call. The men all signed in funny markings to confuse the teacher. I sign my name "Sanders" dead center in blue ink, trying to be legitimate.
