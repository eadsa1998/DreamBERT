I don't know when I had this dream, but suddenly I remembered it: Me and some of my friends in my class at school that was studying ETs, were at a dry dusty place. In front of us was a very high ladder that led to a black blimp-shaped building. We climbed, and when we got to the top we couldn't open the door. It was really dangerous, and we all freaked out. Finally, we got the door open and walked into a nice room with a black leather couch. A man dressed in all black turned to us, surprised. He welcomed us in, but my friends were gone. He was an astronomer, so I stayed to get info for my class that was studying ET life, and somehow I agreed to stay for at least a week. But my parents had wanted me to come home. [Drawing of a blimp-shaped thing with a square cabin hanging below, suspended in space, with a ladder leading up to the cabin door. The blimp has three windows. There are clouds in the sky.] Setting: First at a dusty open area, then in a football shaped building in the sky. Characters: Me, my friends from school, and an astronomer who lived in the blimp building. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, scared, other: I thought everything was weird. I have no idea! It was really WEIRD!
