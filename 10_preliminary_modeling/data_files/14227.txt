I was playing a game online. I was playing the trial version and it let you have a free copy of a book which had something to do with a shadow suitcase. I was watching this 'early' clip of Entourage that had Paula Abdul in it but she was really young and I thought it must've been from the 80's. Ari was played by some British guy who was hitting on some girls in a pub. Eric and Vince were the same. I said "if Ari looked like that, I probably would have never watched it" and I was thinking Jeremy Piven was hoter than that dude. The characters were boring which I thought was probably due to the lack of the real Ari. Mom was talking about Calvin and she asked why I never "got friends off Autumn". Ezra said something about I Want Your Love and then it was playing on the radio and I was singing along.
