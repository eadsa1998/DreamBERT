Matthew and I were going to paint the kitchen. We took down all the Christmas decorations. I specifically remember peeling off the stick-on's, but they were even on the refrigerator door. I kept finding more. When we started painting, we did just a little bit under the windowsill to see how it would look after it dried. The next morning we looked at it and it was a yellowish-beige instead of teal. I took a razor blade and started scraping off the top layer, which exposed the teal. But the teal part was somewhat wet and left it looking rough or textured rather than smooth. I said, well, we could make it work this way. Then Matthew, or perhaps someone else, found the problem and pointed it out. It says to use egg noodles and the ones we used weren't egg. I ate some of the non-egg noodles and then rinsed my mouth as though I had just brushed my teeth. I brushed them over and over again. My teeth and mouth seemed to be coated with teal paint and the water kept rinsing it out. Matthew came up and said, the water is clear now mom! I rinsed a couple more times anyway.
