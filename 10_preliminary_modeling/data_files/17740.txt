It was night, and there were a lot of windows in the apartment my boyfriend Jeremy and I lived in.  The sky was dark.  We were in some sort of restrictive society.  We were going to have sex, but he was called out to work or something.  I thought about inviting the neighbor over to continue where Jeremy and I had left off making out since I was in the mood.
