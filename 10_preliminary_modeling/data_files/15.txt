I'm in a little store with another woman and maybe a kid - looks like an antique store but has other things, including odd-looking Christmas ornaments. I'm admiring some of them - also the others find some bubble-pack things, toys that are from a film whose name they can't place, but I'm familiar with it - takes me a minute to get it right and then there's another related set nearby that's from another movie I recall right away - they're both like children's science-fiction, and English, which is why I know them and the others don't. There is some element of this all being a bit strange.
