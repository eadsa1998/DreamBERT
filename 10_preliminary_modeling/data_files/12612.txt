I was at school and Ms Corbett was laughing, which sounded like a big wheeze, for ages. Finally she just suddenly stopped. She said that she couldn't do certain things, including running. She also told me that she would go in the toilets to practice. She had been laughing because on this excursion form it said 'no making out' and she said that I "wasn't the making out type". I went downstairs and Mr Gutenberg was in a room full of bags. He thought that one bag was mine and I said "What the hell, that's Seamus's!" Evelyn and Elana were standing near a truck. Calvin and Samantha were doing some storyboard thing. Dad and Ezra were waiting in the car. I went to the toilet.
