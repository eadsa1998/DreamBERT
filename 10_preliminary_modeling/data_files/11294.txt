I was in my driveway, but the house where I was living was strange to me. A 1936 Chevrolet car which I had owned was standing in the driveway. Someone told me that the person who had bought the car from me couldn't keep it. He had to give it up, so he was giving it to me. The fenders of the car, which had been dented, were now fixed and painted. I was very glad to have the car back again, especially since I had been told that nothing was wrong with it now.
