A mad scientist had hundreds of people held prisoner, and he forced them to obey him. The building was modern. Guards were all around. The madman looked down upon the people through an observation platform. There were some nuns among the prisoners. I tried to escape. There were some prisoners below on a street within the madman's property. I was led with some others to the streets outside the property. I asked to use a phone, hoping to call the police, but I learned that there was a recorded voice that interfered with the connections. The madman was nearby and he jeered at me, suspecting what I had attempted. A policeman was nearby, and I cried out to him that I was being held prisoner. He listened and nodded.
