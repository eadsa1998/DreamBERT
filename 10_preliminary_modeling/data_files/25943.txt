 People are skiing in wet snow. There is an area with no snow in Vail where people are hiking and cross country skiing. I ask some people if they've seen anyone cross country skiing in the foothills near Jackson, which is where I am. They haven't: it is all hiking, even in snow. I'm on a bicycle and am with my friend Niles Zelling. I go down a hill. The bicycle flips over. It is sunny but cold. I'm dressed warm, but Niles isn't. I say I have a chunk of something slimy in my crotch from masturbating earlier. I think I have female genitals. They feel warm and slimy. I'm at home near the front driveway. A person licks my vagina, and it feels good. Then I am inside the house and have male genitalia. I'm having sex with a woman on a piano bench. I think about how homosexuality is futile in terms of reproduction. I rub the woman's clitoris with my finger as I have sex with her from behind. I'm not sure if she enjoys what I'm doing: I'm just trying things out.
