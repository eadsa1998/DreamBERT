I was at deli with Mom. I wanted Fruit Pastilles. She got them and was embarrassed about something and wanted to leave. There was some nice chocolate. Later, you got points for certain creatures. There was some scorpion thing and I was reading the scorpion list. There was a slug that looked like a dinosaur with a slug instead of a horn on its back.
