I was going to take a trip to Los Angeles to attend some kind of academic conference.  At the airport I ran into Li Min Kim.  He was going back to Korea because of some problem with his eyes.  I had to go up several escalators to get my ticket.  When I got it, I realized I had forgotten my passport.  In case we ended up going to a foreign country, I didn't want to be denied the opportunity.  The plane was to be boarding in 50 minutes, so I figured I had just enough time if I hurried.  The next thing I remember, I was in L.A. waiting to see some professor I know in his anteroom.  Then I was in a large room or an upper floor of a tall hotel.  There were several other people there, including (I think) Jody.  She took some sparklers which looked like long matches and passed them around, and everybody lighted them.  When they had gone out, I thought of my camera -- it would have made a pretty picture -- but there weren't any sparklers left.
