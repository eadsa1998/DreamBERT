I was in Wal-Mart and was looking for a computer keyboard with a touchpad mouse in the keyboard. One of the associates was. It looked like we were either in the toy or the hardware section. We found a black keyboard with half of what I was looking for attached to it. The shelf was coming away from the wall. The associate said they didn't have the rest of it. I was looking back behind that shelf to see if it had fallen down there. She took me to the front and was going to ask so I carried it with me but they didn't have the rest of it so I just gave it to her. I was going to leave and as I was getting ready to leave there were displays that I thought was computer equipment so I stopped to look there to see if they had one but they didn't. They had all of these black plastic cases. Kind of like a case that you would carry a slide projector or something in. They were all different sizes. I went outside and there was a construction company working on the parking lot. They wanted hardly any cars in the parking lot. They had piles of tar here and there that they hadn't smoothed out yet. I was trying to drive around them and stay out of their way. It seems like I did this twice but I don't know why. One time my car was more like a clothing rack on wheels, made of steel pipe like I used at SFI when preparing merchandise for the sales floor. I had to use it kind of like a skateboard. I was trying to go around these piles of tar and stay out of the way of the work trucks. I say Susan A. She said something to me about an event coming up.
