I dream of "My Father's Eye".  It was a source of great power to me.  I was with someone.  We were walking through a fairly dark building, like a city at night.  Plants.  It was a long room.  Partway through I bent down and looked at the Eye.  At the end, I talked to my junior/senior year high school English teacher Ms. Kraft.  I told her about how some of the English classes I'd taken in college allowed more expansion and covering more than the limitations I got from her class, but tried to word it nicely.  Suddenly I wanted her to read some of my works.  We turned and went up a long stairway, closest seen as that up to the dorms at the observatory.  I looked again at My Father's Eye and started to glide, float, fly over the stairs.
