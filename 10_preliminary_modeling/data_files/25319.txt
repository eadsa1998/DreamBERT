 I'm driving my truck with my friend Kevin Simpson. We get off Superhighway 100 and look at a map to see where we are. We are headed for a campground. We decide which direction to go. I back the truck up to turn. I'm on a dock: a cement pier-like structure. I back the truck off the dock halfway into the water. Kevin gets out the driver's side. He has the key to unlock the passenger side door. I am with my friend Melanie McDyss. I drive the truck up on the dock. There are young girls swimming. Melanie and I swim too. We are going out on the lake, later. The truck then seems to be a lawn chair, and I handle it easily. I pick it up and jump into the water off the dock.
