My "baby" is sick. So Howard takes her across the street to the doctor's office. I wait and then get worried. I should have gone with them. I look in the window and see them seated, waiting. I go in, but I can't find them now. I ask a woman clerk where the doctor's. office is. She won't tell me and I push past her and go looking. I find a series of curtained off cubicles Howard and the baby are in one. I join them, sitting by where they are lying down to wait for the doctor.
