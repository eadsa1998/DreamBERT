On a TRAIN with people from the Choir; I go to the diner and the waitress tries to speak GERMAN. I return to my seat and start studying Geography very ostentatiously; see the word Wien on a map with pink and red and black lines. The train stops suddenly and starts up before we can take a walk on the platform; We laugh; At the next stop there is time to walk and I take off my blouse so I can get a sun tan.. Frank appears in a car and he has gray hair. We laugh when the train takes off and moves over to another track; we know we can still get on the train again. We laugh.
