I dreamed that I was at school. Hannah and I were all in the library studying for exams. Neo, from The Matrix, was there getting us to try different kinds of jellybeans. All of a sudden, we were back in the dorm. Sue was showering and Hannah and I were in our room eating Cape Cod chips. When Sue came in, the fire alarm went off. We all had to get out of the building. The sprinklers went off. So then I had a new dream that I was at Audrey's house and Pauline was getting married. Audrey wanted me to ride Pauline's horse into the woods to find the rest of our relatives. When I got on the horse, he started talking to me. Then I woke up.
