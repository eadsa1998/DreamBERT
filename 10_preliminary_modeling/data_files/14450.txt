Ezra, Mom, Clayton, some others and I went to this basketball court, which was near this round booth which the cops used. There was a cage with a dog and if you set the alarm off, it was allowed out. We were playing on the court and the alarm went off, so we ran. We got split up. I was walking around the streets with Mom. There were lots of people standing around in groups. There was also a Chow Chow around somewhere and it was tiny. I was thinking that they were too small and that I had to look at other dog breeds.
