I was watching people going to show. I was with a movie actor. We were in flight from a gang. We got away and then they caught up with us. We were in a building and we finally eluded them. We locked the gate to keep them in, then another gate and the third one was hard to shut tight, so I could put a padlock on. I said, "Let's get in our getaway car and go," but he wanted to lock the last gate or door and our pursuers got out and caught him. I got into the car and got away, but two of the boys were on the running board with me. I was going to get rid of them by giving them a close call by driving close to a tree or post and then all of them to get off or I would knock them off on the next tree. They caught up with me next and I was their prisoner. They told me to drive to our home town and I could go home. I was sitting on a  big truck top. John Delatt and Carter were in the cab. Carter was driving and the truck got away from him. I got off and Delatt chased the truck which was running away. I saw Flight as a winner.
