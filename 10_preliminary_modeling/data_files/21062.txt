I was cutting off bars on the hand machine. They were long ones. I saw a beautiful gray horse. Could he run. He was a young one. Loddie dug a hole in the ground. I was watching bees fly around the house and land on it. Nick Snider gave me a hair cut. Dominic had a tavern and I wanted to buy a bottle of wine from him.
