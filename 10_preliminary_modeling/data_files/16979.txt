There's an institution that has rules about by who and when bikes can be ridden up and down a ramped building. It may be a public building or a private premises. Maybe it's flats - I can't tell. Anyway, an officious guy informs me that today there is a tax to ride bikes down the ramp. It's extortionate - like $50. Rather than pay, I just pick up my bike and just carry it on my shoulder.
