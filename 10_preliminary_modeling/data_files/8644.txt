I answer the phone and a man on the other end answers, with laughter in his voice, This is Dave S. I'm silent for a moment as I don't know who Dave S is, why he is calling, and why the laughter in his voice. He breaks the silence by telling me that I left a message for him. I suddenly recall that I had made some calls for CAS and left messages for a number of people. I did not want to breach confidentiality in my documents so I had listed them by first name and first initial of last name. I became concerned, actually pretty sure, that when I left a message for this person I had actually referred to him as Dave S, using the first initial of his last name when I said it.
