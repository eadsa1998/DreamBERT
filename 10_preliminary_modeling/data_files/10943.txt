I was in my bedroom and the window opened and a baseball player came in. He smiled and said he was looking for something. I asked him who he was and his answer was "a Cleveland Indian" and I was impressed. Then a crowd of the dorm kids came in and I told them, and they smiled and said he wasn't. He carried an aluminum rod which I supposed to be a bat. Then he leaped out of the window onto a tremendous ball field and suddenly there were hundreds and hundreds of people and they were all stampeding somewhere, while many others were playing baseball. I laughed because suddenly I saw that the Cleveland Indian wasn't one at all and he laughed too. I don't know why. He was medium height with black hair and very brown eyes. I know I'd seen him before. The people were running, very happily--it was some sort of a game. It bewildered me, but didn't too much faze me.
