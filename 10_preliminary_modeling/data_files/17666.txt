I was with my boyfriend Jeremy.  Received a call from my mother's college friend Lynn, that she couldn't get into her place, I think.  Jeremy had taken the call so I didn't get to hear the details, but it was urgent.  So I drove down the main street, talking to Jeremy on the cell about how to get there.  He said to continue on, and in doing so, I ran into a narrow residential area, and he said I was there.  I went around to knock on the back door, and Jeremy said no, he'd do it.  Lynn's son Jonathan seemed to be the threat, and he's a big kid, quite dangerous when angry.  Ironically we decided Jeremy should go to the door because he'd talked to him recently (on the phone while I was driving) and would know him better- so when Jonathan answers the door, Jeremy should prepare for a hit, and after the first one, Jonathan should recognize him.
