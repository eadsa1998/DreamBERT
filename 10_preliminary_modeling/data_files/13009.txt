Ezra, Clayton, some others and I were at this spooky house. We went in there and we had Pokemon with us and these creepy 'Chibi' people were giving me scents. I was thinking they were useless since I couldn't smell. I was playing some Mario game and I had to get up this waterfall and I found this thing to help me. I thought it would help me fly but it just made me go a bit faster.
