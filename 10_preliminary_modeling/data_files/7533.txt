I am riding around in a vehicle that is sometimes a bicycle and sometimes a car. I am going/driving into all kinds of strange areas. Suddenly I think to myself that this is not fair of me to be off on my own when I could be with Mary and enjoying the day with her. So I turn around and head for home. Somewhere during the dream I see Mary at home. She is smiling and going about her chores in a contented manner. There is no hint of illness or death in this dream.
