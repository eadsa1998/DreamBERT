I was visiting with V.S. She kept talking and I was thinking I want to get downstairs and read that book. Then her parents came in and began to say farewells. I said, "But I'm not going yet." He said, "But it's 9:00 and you must catch your train." I said, "But I don't know where I'm going next." And go to look in suitcase for itinerary (which I found yesterday and laid out) but I can't locate it. I think I put it in a pocket. I feel quite irritated at their apparent desire to get rid of me. (I wake at 9:10 a.m.)
