I am still attending college and my family joins me for a morning awards ceremony at which I am being honored. My brother X. is asked to say a few words, but his speech is lengthy and he makes the ceremony last until 11:45 a.m. Now it is time to pack up all of my things and leave the apartment for the summer. I am passive in this dream.
