My twin brother, my friend Mort, and I were going to the fraternity barn dance. I was driving as we were to call for the girls at 8:30. After picking up my date, we waited for a phone call from Mort. By 11:30 he had not called as my date, my brother and I drove out to the dance. Mort and his date were already there. We then drove back on a road with streetcar tracks. I left my brother at his date's house and went to my house to change clothes (for some unknown reason). While at my house, my date (age 19) and I were alone. We were waiting for my brother to call. I thought to myself that this was an opportune moment to make love to my date. Just then however, my mother and dad reutnred and I was trying to explain to them why my date and I were alone in our house.
