["Ocean bites our butts on the couch."] I am visiting someone's house. We are outside. Bonnie has asked the owner of the house if she could keep her plants there for awhile. She is there to visit them and see how they are doing. I look out and see the ocean quite a ways away. Bonnie and I greet each other. Then I see a wave coming toward us. We are surprised and begin to run toward the house. We are going up a very steep sand dune and Bonnie is on her belly flailing away. I am crawling. It is hard going. We struggle and barely make it to the open carport. We sit on a couch and the wave comes right up to us. Even spraying us a bit. We are very surprised. Now Bonnie is stirring a huge metal bowl full of figs and nuts. She calls this an orchard mix she made. Sort of like a cookie dough. She looks at her hanging plants. Someone isn't taking good care of them.
