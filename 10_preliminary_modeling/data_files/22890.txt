I had just arrived at an airport and was walking along a long concourse with Carl Schneider and, possibly, part of the way, Louis Schrepp.  Both were in uniform, I believe; I was not.  We were talking about our military experiences.  After a while, the concourse became the underside of the grandstand at a race track.  We were joined by Ellen Walstein who was just getting off work for lunch.  She suggested we have lunch at "Sardo's."  It seems there were enough of us to require 2 cars.  As we walked to the cars, I could see our car (the Sunbeam) a block or more away, and pointed it out to Ellen.  When we got to Sardo's, we looked in the window and saw that it wasn't a very big place, and the tables were all full.  All the men wore coats and ties, too, as did everyone in our group except me.  I felt a little out of place.
