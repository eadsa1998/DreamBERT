My boyfriend Jeremy, my mother and I were at the bank.  There was some confusion or difficulty with my deposit.  I crawled under a chair, and I think my shoes were missing.  We left the bank and arrived back at the house.  At some point I lost my clothes, and I was walking along the side of the house.  The neighboring old lady was in her yard, so I tried to crouch along the fence until I got past her.  I guess I got my clothes back, and then Jeremy and I were in the garage of someone's house- perhaps a neighbor.  The neighbor was going to take the jet skis out of the garage as a favor to us, somehow.
