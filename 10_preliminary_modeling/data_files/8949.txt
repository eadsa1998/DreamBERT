I arrived at an airport for a layover. Everyone had to claim their luggage between flights and recheck it for their connecting flights. Neither the baggage claim area or the area where we rechecked it looked like they do in waking life. The airport was very crowded with people. There was an African-American man and his son. His son had a developmental disability. I'm guessing he might have been 12 or 13-years-old. He was just a little short than I and bit bigger in body size. He had a black artist portfolio with him. He picked it up, turned it vertically and put it under his arm to carry it that way rather than using the handle. It's as though he is being very protective of it. I said something to him about his portfolio just to be friendly. Neither of them were very receptive. I felt bad for bothering them but I was also confused as I didn't know why they would respond the way they did to my effort to be friendly.
