The first part of the dream had something to do with my good online friend Del, or a friend of his.  Then I was in my university town.  I went down a steep driveway into a green area to pick something up, and turned around to leave.  When I got back out of the area, I met up with my boyfriend Jeremy.  Behind us there was a fighter jet that had been hit by the Iraqi army and was on its way toward crashing into the ground.  I woke up temporarily.  When I went back to sleep, I was standing where we were when the jet crashed behind us.  I was sitting at some sort of machine that allowed me to watch the dream over again.
