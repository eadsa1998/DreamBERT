In Game of Thrones, Tyrion got killed. It was half off-screen and I was like 'what they can't kill Tyrion', it looked pretty final though [the last episode it looked like he died]. Joffrey was killed too. His lifeforce was in a sword and Sansa was going to smash it. His mother was different and she came and she couldn't smash it. I was thinking they would find Tyrion hiding out somewhere.
