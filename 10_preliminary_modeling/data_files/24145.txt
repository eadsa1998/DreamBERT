I  had two kids. I remember my boyfriend being there by my side although he wasn't talking or anything. I remember seeing his face very clear because other times I don't. The babies in my dream were young. The oldest child was probably ten months, the youngest child looked like a newborn. In my dream I knew they were my kids, but if felt as though they didn't know I was their mother. I remember paying more attention to the oldest child who was a boy. I do remember him being with another couple but then they disappeared and the boy was with me.
