I am leaving Ginny's to go home, but have to stop off at a hospital because I'd made an appointment with a woman administrator to look at my books (children's books), but I can't remember for sure the time (3:30 or 6:30) and then I can't remember her name. We get there and ask and go to an auditorium where a speaker is talking to a full house. Charla is handed person to person because they think she is so cute. I cry out, "Give me back my baby!" I am upset and worried they'll keep her. The crowd is frowning at me. I'm being silly and hysterical. I ask a man what group this is and he finally understands my question and says, "Illustrators." Then the speaker says, "We ran over three minutes, so you'd better get back to work!" I was amazed they had such strict "factory" like rules about how they work. I go to wait in a coffee shop. Ellie, Ginny and Charla are with me. I lecture Charla on being careful about strangers. I dig through my packs to find my flyers and can't find them, but see a skirt I was going to change into to look more professional. I haven't time now. I feel scattered and frustrated.
