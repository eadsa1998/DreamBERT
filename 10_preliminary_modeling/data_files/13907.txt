I was at Eugene's for some reason. His mother made these cookie things. She dropped them and I was picking them up. Eugene and his father Abraham asked how to spell my name. I spelt it out and they said "we would've called you Katie Sophie". There was a water container and we were refilling it. I was talking about Simba. We then had houses on the beach.
