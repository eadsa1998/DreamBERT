I was at a school with my mother- she was coordinating some event.  While she did that I talked to a boy.  He was nice, and it seemed like he liked me.  That made me feel good, but I wondered how I could let him know I was taken without hurting him.  When my mother had finished things up, we were getting ready to go.  I noticed I was covered in grass stains for some reason, so my friend Deanna and I went to take a shower.  I had foamy soap in my hands and I wanted to lather Deanna up, but I realized I still had my clothes on and stopped to take them off first.  In doing so I turned, and I saw hair, as if someone were trying to hide below the windowsill of the bathroom.  It was my father.  I asked him what he was doing- he said he was hiding from Jabba the Hut, and waiting for my brother Stuart to arrive because somehow he knew how to deal with him.
