I went downtown with a friend of mine in the streetcar. The downtown section was populated with small people who were smaller than dwarfs. They were ugly and all the clothes and skin were black. While I was riding up the escalator one of these black persons was chasing me. In the meanwhile my friend deserted me. While I was in the store, I got a motorcycle and toured the town while this person was chasing me, but I never found out who it was.
