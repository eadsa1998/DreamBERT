I am drawing a seating arrangement where the helpers are at the heads of the tables. Then it's time to go to classes. I try to find the Crafts room #12. I find #13 and discover it is upstairs. I peek and it is a wood-working class. I get out of my wheelchair and walk up. The teacher suggests I don't take any other classes this term, only focus on this one. I suggest maybe I'll take ceramics. He disapproves. I see the lovely wood grains on a piano a student made. I see the textbook. It has music scores in it.
