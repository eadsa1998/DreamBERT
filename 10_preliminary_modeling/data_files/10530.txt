We are on a farm with meadows; see water troughs; a black dog like Zena's. Later I see a poor woman with sad blue eyes, who ordered items from Sears catalogue, and she checks them off and gives or sells them to us (candles, odds and ends), vivid image of the woman as she hands me the various items. I don't really want them and tell Willie sternly he must come with us on the trip. Father Andrew is there too; he shows his children his gold watch. ending?
