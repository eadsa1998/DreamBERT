I was trying (either successfully or unsuccessfully, I don't remember) to get a pretty young girl into my car near her house.  It was night, she lived in a small wooden house in a hilly area (like a small cabin in a beach area), and I had a little sports car convertible.  Much of my time was then spent fleeing from her parents or whoever was pursuing me as a result.
