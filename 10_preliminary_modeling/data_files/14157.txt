I was at school, which was different. I was outside. We had these cords connected to us and mine got tangled underneath the building and other random places. I went to the office and I pulled it out of the wall and went to Ms Pascal, who was in a meeting. She took it and told me to leave. I came back later and she gave me a "toxic turtle". Classmate-F-06, Lydia and I were in this small room with a big window and a door leading outside. Classmate-F-06 asked if anyone here couldn't smell. I said I couldn't and neither did she. Then Lydia said she couldn't either. I said "your mother" and Lydia glared at me and it turned out her mother was dead. I thought it was odd that three people here couldn't smell. I was thinking I had to tell Mom. There was some game and Calvin visited me and gave me furniture for my room on the game.
