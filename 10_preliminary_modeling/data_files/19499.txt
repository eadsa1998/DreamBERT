Two young men playing tennis. Both fairly tall (about 5' 10"), and dressed in white. Both are better than average players. One man serves both balls in strong court -- apparently intentionally -- and then asks privilege of re-serving the second ball. This was permitted by his opponent who, however, seemed doubtful as to the justice or propriety of this action. At another time one serve curved sharply and struck outside of court before reaching net.
