There is a river that is flowing with rapids. Some times it just disappears and all that is left is a lot of mud. Then the water flows up again. There are small, cute kittens romping in the "mud/river." They are hunting and eating chickens. There is something cold and terrible about it. They pounce and eat as the chicken fights frantically for life. I need to float down river. It is full of heavy metal objects that could hurt. There are two waterfalls I shall have to go over. It is dangerous.
