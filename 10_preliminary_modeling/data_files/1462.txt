It's Christmas and we are going to open our gifts, so we go to the ocean shore line. I think, "Oh, it will be unpleasant in the cold water, but only at first." Then we move a gold railroad track off center. We build a bonfire on the beach. It will be more comfortable there. Before this, there were little leaping lizards that I didn't like. I had someone pick it up and put it on the bread board. There were worms there for it to eat. I wondered why I didn't put it in the drawer beneath it.
