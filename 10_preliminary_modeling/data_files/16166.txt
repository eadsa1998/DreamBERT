Me and Hayleigh were trying to make something and I had these three-dimensional cookie dough kids, these little statues and a three-dimensional heart statue. And I was trying to stand them up on the cookie sheet and make the kids hold the heart, but they kept falling down and rolling around, and I don't know how I was going to bake them. But Mom was going to bring Terri and Mrs. Dougherty over for tea or something. I knew I had to hurry up and get them in the oven so they'd have time to bake, but I couldn't get the darned things to stand up. But once I did get them in the oven, Hayleigh, something happened and Hayleigh pushed two very delicate plates off the shelf and they broke all over the floor and everything, so then I had a mess to clean up. I don't remember too much more. Then I woke up.
