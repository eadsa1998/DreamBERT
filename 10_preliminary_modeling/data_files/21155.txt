I was by Andy Palider's place. He was building a crib of some kind and I looked at the screws he put on. They were shined up or polished by himself. I saw a coin on the ground. Mrs. Lenacic picked it up and then threw it down. I told Audrey to pick it up and give it to me. It was a half dollar and the bibbit between it to hold it together was too thick and it made the half dollar too thick and no one wanted it in trade.
