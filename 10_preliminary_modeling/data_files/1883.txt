I am in a group of people and we go into the social science schoolroom. I see Joe K seated at a desk. I sit with Tyler who wears white gloves. He is being teased about having bad breath and he leans over to me and breathes out and says, "Do I?" I say, "No. It's fine." Then the group is upset at two of the women leaders. They don't trust them. I think the women are OK.
