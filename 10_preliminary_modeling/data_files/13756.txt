I stayed at Mom's, which was actually Nana's, but was completely different. Eugene, Darius, Jeremiah and Alejandro were staying there. The next morning Mom was going to go to the deli and Darius, Jeremiah, Alejandro and Ezra went with her. Mom said that "Eugene is still asleep". I was playing on a computer outside all the rooms (which was outside on a balcony, ledge thing). I went down the stairs and got a new water bottle and it was school (but different). That fat Denton was annoying me. I was fighting with him and kicking him and throwing water bottles at him. I locked him in a shed. My water bottle was in some sand. I saw Eugene's father Abraham in a car and they all left. Alejandro was still there though. I complained to some people, including Autumn, about the Native kid. There was some The Simpsons thing about corn and they were eating it. I was at home and Dad said the internet was working. It was but the ADSL light still wasn't on (we didn't even have the router plugged in).
