Ezra and someone who I think was Madelyn, were doing a cooking job. Mom took them there and I made sure they got in. They said they finished at 8.30-9.30. I left. There were no cars. I had some 'fake' lights and I was walking along the road and they weren't very bright. A car came up behind me, but got on the other side of the road instead. Another guy did it too, but then it was Madelyn and she said they both left early because of "one with ADH and one with TDD" which were illnesses with different reactions to the sun. I called Mom and said we were just past "Brookland, the school". She thought I meant somewhere else but finally understood. Then I was hiding out in a building with Adam Baldwin and others. I wandered outside and a guy was like "I'm on fire!" and someone tried to help and I pulled them back. There were flames behind him, like a mob. He was then ok and ran. Then he stopped and went back. I ran out to get this guy and a flame had followed him. I hid behind a tree and it killed him. Then it showed from the flames point of view and it could sense body heat and it started coming after me and then saw 'Jayne Cobb, cunning' and it went after him instead. Eventually it went away. We also tried to escape from a building and we had to break down doors. This guy was hiding somewhere and we risked it and went in, but he came at me and we attacked him. There was a photo of Adam Baldwin when he was young and it said "Chariate Chassiel" and he had some instrument. He was holding this square thing and had a ring on his middle finger. I asked him who the hell Chassiel was. There was a picture of a girl and she was 'Senator' (she was a celebrity now). I turned the photo around and Dad was there. I said, about the picture of Adam Baldwin, "I'd rather see him peeing in a bowl, naked". There was a fat naked guy and a young toddler. Adam said "that's my father, Moby Dick".
