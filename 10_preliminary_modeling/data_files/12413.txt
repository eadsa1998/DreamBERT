Nana said she had some people over who had a son my age. He was weird, but I liked him and I think he liked me. He managed to convince people to go near the bird cage. He had presents for everyone. I looked for mine and it looked like had a love heart crossed out. I wanted to get on a laptop. Poppa went to the toilet. I was talking to a girl about the guy and how he knew that I liked him. Then there were Pokemon wasp-looking things and Marill. Jayson was there.
