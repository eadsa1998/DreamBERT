 I'm outside a large building on a college campus, like Middleton College or Washington University. There is a tour going on and some young black kids selling candy. One has a crate full of stuff that I look at. In it are some quarts of milk with two plastic cups on them, and some candy, jellybeans I think. There is a bin of plastic eggs nearby. People toss the eggs here after removing their candy contents. There is some candy on the ground: three pieces. I eat it.
