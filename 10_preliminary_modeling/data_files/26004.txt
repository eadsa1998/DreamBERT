 I'm in the basement at home doing laundry. My former boss Mike Hollow and my high school friend Binky Ahmed are there. Binky tells me about a dream he had, and we talk about it. I do laundry as I talk. Mike doesn't say anything about me not working. I set the laundry machine on medium. When I realize the load of laundry is bigger I try to change the size setting to large, but I can't, so I leave some of the clothes out. In Binky's dream, something or someone fills him with hot water. I immediately have an impression from the dream. I have a little trouble putting my thoughts into words, but I tell him his dream seems to depict him getting "filled with hot air", or full of nothing. Though water and air are two different things, the point is the same. Binky understands and seems to appreciate my insight: he didn't think of that before. Mike listens, saying nothing. There is a man who lies on the floor in white brief underwear as if her were sun tanning.
