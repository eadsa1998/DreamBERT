I was at the beach. The waves were getting bigger and bigger and I started walking away. They were massive by this point and I started to run. Dad took us to his house and I said it wouldn't be safe and that I had had dreams before of huge waves. There was a big window and we saw the wave come crashing through. We started going down these stairs, which were flooding, but we found our way down. We were going down the street. More waves were coming our way. Someone hosted some party which was all painted and fancy, but there were stingy rooms. An old guy complained and I explained about the waves. Apparently aliens were stealing our water.
