Andy P. and I were going to school. We were students or pupils. Andy was reading a topic in one of the books. The sentence was a long name. It had a lot of words which were together in one long word and it had to be separated and read out of this long worded sentence or phrase. I went by a window and looked in and saw a young lady and boy laying down rugs.
