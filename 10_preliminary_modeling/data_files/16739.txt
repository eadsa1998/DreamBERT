I have a dream where I'm a junior at Prep Academy, graduating. For some reason, the school decided to get rid of the seniors and replace them with death row inmates. As they walk by me for the last time, I feel I know some of them. Most of them seem to be older men in their 60's. I say, "I'll miss you" and "I love you" to some of them as they're walking through some doors. Then I feel a strong desire to go to "the park" (where's "the park"?) to hang out with this girl who I don't even really know (but had a sort of a crush on before, Nancy). Now I ask Riley if he knew any "single" girls at his school. I think I asked him for a list of 3 single girls. But he told me about these girls that I haven't even heard of (and I even went to his school the year before last). Now I hug this girl A.M, tell her I have a crush on her, and another girl, Eva thinks I'm talking to her.
