I was at Nana's. They had these beds with sheets and we all had our own bed. Uncle Wilbur was in his bed. Ezra and Dad's were next to his and mine was at the end. Then I went to a Jetts Gym to check it out. There was a line on the floor (which was tiled) and I followed it. This girl climbed up this thing and fell. It was fake and was a special effects demonstration. There was a very big treadmill and I was looking at the buttons. This guy got on and it was really fast and I slowed it down. After he was done, I got on and it kept changing speeds and was faulty. This guy said they would have to recall them. They asked if I wanted to join the gym and brought me to this office. He said he would call me on Monday to sort it out (it was Friday). I told Mom when I got home. Then we had ID chips in our ears that could be scanned and mine said I was married to Robert Downey Jr.
