I was on a path, seemed like Utah in the outback.  I came to parts that were so narrow they were dangerous.  You had to duck and crawl under overhangs in the path, and you could easily fall off the ledges in these parts.  I stopped or went back to think over going any further.  I wondered or said aloud how do horses make it through these paths without falling, and I imagined what horses would do here, imagined them climbing under the overhangs or going over the ledges and climbing up the rocks.
