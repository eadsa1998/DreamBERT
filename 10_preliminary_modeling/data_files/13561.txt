I drove to Dad's 'work'. This guy jumped into the passenger seat and asked if I had any 'E'. I was like "Huh?". He said ecstasy and I was like "Why the hell would I have that?!". He got out and was talking to his friends and they said I was cool. I went to this cheesecake shop and Evelyn worked there. I said it was nice in here because it was cool and had mud cakes. Evelyn was talking to me about the seating on the bus and that I always sat next to Calvin. Then we got on a plane and it was going around in circles. There were some Spanish guys. We then ran into an antiques shop and when we left it there was a swamp. I jumped over onto a ladder and there were retards hanging on to different obstacles. I had to swing onto this thing and get past a lady.
