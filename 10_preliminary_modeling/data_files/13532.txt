I had gone to the UK and met The Beatles and they had to sign in a card. John Lennon was there. Then I was at 'school'. I had my Beatles shirt on and someone asked me about them. Ms Braun was doing S+E stuff. I had been away and she asked me something about antioxidant and I said "I don't even know what antioxidant is". She said I should've straightened my hair. She gave me DVD's of Superbad and one with Michael Cera in it and two others. I asked if I could take them home to watch (so I could burn them) and she said no. I was in a room. Some girl, Megahn Perry, David Fickas and I were there. The girl and Megahn were supposed to best friends but Megahn liked me and the other girl was annoyed. I liked the David Fickas guy and I think he liked me but he was hanging out with this other guy.
