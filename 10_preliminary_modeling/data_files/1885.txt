I'm on a rented bus. It's a women's study group. There are 7 men on the bus. I stand up, counting them. That's better than it used to be. Used to be only one or two men would attend that kind of class. One man says it would be better if we made it more comfortable for men to attend. I sit down and Ellie and the baby come to sit next to me. I hold the baby while Ellie crawls over me to get into the window seat. I lick on the baby's ice cream cone. Then it's time to get off. I now watch as a quad man goes to visit the house of a quad woman named Ruby. The bottom half of her house had been burnt. The structure still stands but the boards are charred. I lie on a grassy hill and look up at a beautiful silhouetted scene and say, "I wish I had a camera!" It was the profile of a woman and a child and another figure. I then roll over and eat some pancakes with syrup on it. I get back to the bus, only now I have to leave it and go walk to E City. It was a one-way cruise. I start walking. The bus owner comes up and says someone broke the vacuum cleaner and will I pay for it?
