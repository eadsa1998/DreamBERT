I was in my former elementary school where I was standing with friends for a health class. I went to use a bookfinder. In order to get into it, I had to play a game where I was a stealth bomber and I had to bomb a train. So I was flying and I missed the train and I crashed. Then I appeared by the plane and I walked in with a police officer and we walked into a bedroom in the plane and Clint Eastwood was laying in the bed with one arm in a sling and another holding a shotgun. Music started playing and I dove out of the way and the gun went off and shot the cop. I then went outside of the plane holding Clint Eastwood up and people where there clapping.
