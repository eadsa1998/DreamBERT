I dreamt that I was walking up a street and I met a friend of mine who was in her wedding dress. She was to be married that afternoon and she told me to come to the vacant lot where her friends were, as they wanted to see me. I said no, as I had not been asked to the wedding and felt self-conscious about being around there. However, next thing I knew I was there on some unknown porch, visiting with some old school-friends of mine. The girl whom I most wanted to see was not there, however. As the bride left for the church, she told me to come to the wedding, so I went home to get my husband, who said we shouldn't go. I woke up.
