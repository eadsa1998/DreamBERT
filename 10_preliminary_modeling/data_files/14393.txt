I was at school. Eugene was there. The teacher asked him who he thought liked him. Calvin was near me and said it was going to be me. They told him to write it on a piece of paper and if it was right he'd get $5. I figured he'd put down me as well and left out of annoyance. I came back and some time later I saw a $5 note on a piece of folded up paper. I opened it and it said 'Jasmine' and I was wondering who the hell Jasmine was.
