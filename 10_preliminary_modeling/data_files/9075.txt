I was working with a group of people on an outdoor project of some type. I was in a helicopter with one of the men I was working with. He was piloting the helicopter. Another man we were working with was piloting another helicopter at the same time. The two helicopters got very close to each other midair so the two pilots could reach out a window for one to hand the other something. We were now all in the basement of my birth home. We were very tired from whatever we had been working on and were lying on the sofas, resting. Quite a few members of my family were upstairs baking cookies and making gingerbread houses. One of the houses had been put together and was sitting on a table in the basement but it had not yet been decorated. After a little while, I decided to get up and work on decorating the gingerbread house that was sitting down there. I began by running white icing along all of the wall and ceiling joints. The man I had been in the helicopter with got up and decided to help me. I was surprised that he wanted to do this.
