This dream took place in a church. I had a very beautiful singing voice and was standing by the altar singing Ave Maria. While I was in the middle of my song some businessmen offered me opera and Hollywood contracts. At that time I was angry to think they would go so far as to interrupt a church service for their own affairs rather than at least wait until it was over. I refused their offer, feeling that if God gave me a beautiful voice, I could well use it by honoring him. Alongside me was a priest and in front of me were people praying.
