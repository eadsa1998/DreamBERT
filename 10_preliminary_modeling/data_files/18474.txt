Salad on a stick was a long wooden skinny stick with hunks of lettuce and tomato quarters. Carrot disks and raisins were alternated on the carrot raisin salad sticks. Spheres of coconut (about 4" in width, and obviously cracked violently from the coconut shell were alternated with arbitrary slices of pineapple, ranging from 3 to 6 inches. The sticks were the diameter of a bobby pin and about 18 inches long. Cantaloupe was the only thing not on a stick so I ordered that and ate it the way we did on grandpa's farm. The cashier and I were having an argument about the way cantaloupe should be eaten. I said it was a question of geography--and the way I ate cantaloupe was proper farm etiquette.
