I was watching after my godmother's triplets - they were younger, in diapers again.  They had been brought up the stairs and one looked at me, happy to see me.  I knelt down and hugged him.  There was a bad smell, as my mother was changing the diapers on one, then she left to throw the diaper away.  While she was gone another one needed a change, so I changed it. Again the bad smell.  There wasn't much in the diaper, but it stunk.  I carried it off to throw it away, and somehow in the process I got some poop under my fingernail.  I was disgusted and began washing my hands, so I took some of my mother's soap.  It was thick and green, like guacamole.  I covered my hands in it to wash them clean.  Then later in the kitchen, my mother asked me about it, wondering what happened to all her soap.  She was suspicious, and told me how expensive it was and I shouldn't use a lot.  I stood there hoping maybe she'd decide one of the triplets got into it.
