This dream was very strange. I was hunting demons. The only thing I had to hunt them with was a sword. It seemed to be happening in the nighttime. I had a companion with me, a girl. I can't remember anything about her -- why she was there, if she was a friend or relative, or if I saved her from something. All I can really remember is the desire to kill these demons. I'm not sure why I wanted to, but I think it is because they did something to me or my family, or they took something from me.
