I dreamt that a boy named Francis, whom I know only by sight and who went to our class yesterday to present a talk on his specialty (Economics), had gone to visit us at home. In our house we were celebrating I don't know which holiday, but not in the living room as it is usually done, but in the rear patio where not too long ago some old rooms had been torn down in order to start a garden in that place. It was a gay night. My uncles were laughing, drinking, and hugging each other, and I remember that I saw Francis among my uncles, a thing that surprised me, since it was the first time that I had seen him with them. My parents liked him very well, at least I heard some comments to that effect. Some pictures of this boy were taken and he got to take part in the general celebration. In the dream I was just a spectator and had a feeling of surprise and astonishment seeing him there; I asked myself what he was doing in our home.
