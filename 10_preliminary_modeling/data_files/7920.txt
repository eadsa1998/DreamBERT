The characters were like little plastic toys but they were real/alive. This couple decided that they really needed a vacation so they decided to take off and I think they were just going out to do something fun for the day. It was as though there were two of the wife. It wasn't two separate women but two of the same woman. They went and got into their little toy car and were going to leave. Now just one of the wives was in the car. They were having trouble getting out of their garage. I helped them somehow. It was as if I was playing with toys because I bent over and reached down and helped them. Some of the neighbors came out after them. They were angry with them. They drove their car up a set of stairs. They were running back into their apartment to get away from someone. Now real people were inside an apartment. There were two people sitting in old-fashioned bathtubs full of water. One really large man came in. He is one that they had been trying to get away from. He had nothing on but shorts/boxers/swimming trunks. I came up behind him and grabbed his ankles and made him fall head first into one of the tubs. The person sitting in the tub held the man's head beneath the water until he drowned.
