There is a huge snake being used by farmers to plow the fields. I am in the field. The snake comes at me fast. I keep trying to catch its mouth like my father taught me to do so it can't bite me. The snake is at least 20 feet long but skinny. The farmers are a danger to me. I want to get away from them but first I have to get control of the snake.
