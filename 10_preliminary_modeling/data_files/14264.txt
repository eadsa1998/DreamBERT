I was out the front of home. It was on a different street and on the opposite side it is now though. I had a CD playing in this guy from across the road's car. He said something to Mom and she said to me that he'd said he liked "12 female singers". I was like "ok...". As we were getting ready to leave, it was now night, we heard sirens. Mom quickly drove into this driveway and did these quick, spiffy turns so she was facing out the driveway. The ambulances and other emergency vehicles pulled up in the driveway in the house next to the one we pulled up in. We drove off and there were teenagers playing at the park.
