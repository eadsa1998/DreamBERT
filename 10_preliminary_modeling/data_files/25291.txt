 I'm in my friend Kevin Simpson's bedroom, but is seems like my friend Bubba Hacker's house. There are two men and three women there. One of the women is for me. She wants to have sex. She puts my hand on her crotch. I am drinking a Pepsi. I want to take a shower before we have sex, because I stink. After I finish the Pepsi, I get up to go shower. I go upstairs. The house is being remodeled. I look for a bathroom with a lock on the door. There are no closed in bathrooms. I find two stalls. My friend's father Philip Hacker and another man urinate in them. Then my friend Stephen Ramos and I go in. I go in the one that Philip used. I wipe urine off the rim of the toilet seat with toilet paper. I think there is no more toilet paper, and I need more. Then I see another role. Stephen and I both defecate. His toilet is a couple of feet higher than mine. I can see him. There is a party going on around us. It is a very modern house.
