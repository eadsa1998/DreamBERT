We were at Adventure World. There was a big shop in the middle of it. I kept getting lost. There was an inside rollercoaster. The guy got angry when I didn't want to go on it anymore. Ezra and Mom were coming and I forgot. They sat on this bench around the corner from me for ages until I remembered. There was a plastic waterslide thing which really sucked.
