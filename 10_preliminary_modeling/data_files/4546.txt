["Snake woman."] I am near a river. I see a snake in the river and feel fear. Then I look closer and see that a woman killed the snake and gutted it, chopping off its head. She is in it so that her human head and shoulders shows, the rest is this huge snake. She swims around in the river. She doesn't look friendly. I stay away from her.
