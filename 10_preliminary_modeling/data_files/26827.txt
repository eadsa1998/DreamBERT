 I'm with a person who may be my friend Melanie McDyss near a country dirt road. We walk towards the road. There are two people there. We talk about North Dakota tourists. I tell the people that the place to go is three miles in one direction. We cross a dirt road where there is fast-driving traffic, and walk down the road. We're in a car. There are six people in it. My friend Paul Jones is driving. We're riding to school. He drives fast; the shoulder of the road is bumpy. I sit in back on the right. I try to fasten my safety belt but the chest strap for it is broken. Paul asks us to close the windows to help clean or defrost them. I think it's already stuffy in the car, and say it will take ten or 15 minutes to air out and clean the windows whether they're open or closed. There is a new boat for sale. There are men in dresses who appear, something happens as a joke. We approach Tressel. I go inside when we stop at a gas station. I see a manual camera for $9.08. I stop to look at it, and am very interested in buying it. The man who runs the station comes over to me. He is my acquaintance Jackie's father. He talks about Jackie, and asks me if I know her. I say yes: She was in Australia when I was, and I lived near her Salt Lake City. He makes a comment on how we better watch out now that we're back in Tressel, implying changes in her relationships with men. He may think I'm one of her old boyfriends.
