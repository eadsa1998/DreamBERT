Sherry Lady and I are doing gentle aerobic exercises. I decide I want to do an obstacle course run. I start running across a field. Sometimes I slow to a walk. I get across it diagonally and turn left to climb fast up a steep hill, with stone stairs. Jock had seen me running and decides he'd better get ahead of me and pace me, so he does. We scramble up the hill stairs and then turn left to go across a dirt and dead logged area with a very dangerous steep downhill side. He stomps his boots into the dirt for better traction. It looks pretty scary and I almost decide the risk of sliding down hill is too great, but I decide to go for it. I walk carefully but lightly over the dirt ridge area. I do so safely. Next is a straight up "chimney" like structure with ropes hanging down. Jock goes up hand over hand shouting and grunting and swearing. I follow him up, going hand over hand fairly easily.
