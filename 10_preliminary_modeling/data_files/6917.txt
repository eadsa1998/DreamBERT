At long tables. My plate had just been served when the waiter took it away. I called for him to bring it back. Even when I called at kitchen door filled with waiters, no luck. So I began to fill my plate again, fish with sauce mashed potatoes and gravy, green peas. As I started back to seat, a child on crutches called, "Look out!" The peas were sliding off. I retrieved some and replenished the fish.
