I dreamed I was at the beach and that there were lots of people. I swam and swam and it seemed strange to me that I could swim so much without getting tired. Then it was nighttime, and I was still at the beach, and I knew everyone there. The beach was full of people, just like in the daytime, and I knew everybody. I kept recognizing them one by one and they smiled at me and we were eating sandwiches and drinking a soda with a strange name. It was a new thing. I didn't like the drink, but everybody said it was very good and I tasted it several times, but didn't like it.
