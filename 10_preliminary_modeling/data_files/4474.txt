["Someone's in my bed."] Gaston and I are together. It is a gentle pleasant relationship. We are on a vacation. I feel tired and I tell him I am going into my cabin to take a nap. I walk across a lawn and into a rustic cabin. I am startled to see it is dirty and messy. No one has cleaned it in months. I look into the cupboard and I see fresh donuts. I touch one to see if it is really fresh. It really is. That means someone has been here recently. I turn and walk to the bedroom door and peek in. I see an odd bay window only it juts into the room, not out. I see a bed with two old people, a man and a woman sleeping in my bed. I am shocked. I tip toe out, embarrassed. Perhaps I'm in the wrong cabin. I stand on the porch. I see a baby elephant, a cat and a baby coming toward me. They all want the baby bottle full of milk. The elephant is sucking on it. Then the cat uses it. I hand it to the baby as well so It can get a sip. I wonder if sharing that bottle is safe. I go back into the small vacation trailer Gaston and I share. I want to go to the business office and complain about these old people in my cabin. We walk together to the office. We go in and I am surprised to see my "ex-husband" Richard there. He's the boss. I am annoyed. He won't listen to my problem well. Gaston and I walk out again.
