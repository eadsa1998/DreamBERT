I just had an incredible dream and I'm not even sure I can begin to describe it except that I was part of a team working on a special project for the government. We enter our vehicle and our learning facility for several months. The place I selected for us to go was very well ___ to us. We were able to go under the water without worrying about our breathing. We came back I was going to church. TH with family. I was sitting outside and there were a lot of table and chairs sitting outside in the grass. People were sitting there eating. I had a McDonald's meal and was going to sit down and eat it before going in to Mass. I was having trouble finding a place to sit. I finally ended up sitting on a cement wall. While I was eating, the church choir came out and started practicing. They were in three sections, but they played instruments also. One section was playing violin and singing and I thought that was unusual. Everybody went in for Mass. I went in, went to one section, and saw that there were a lot of seats. It was a side section of the church. It was kind of behind a wall so you couldn't see very well. I went to check another section first. Then I saw my whole family sitting there and they waved for me to come up and sit with them. I did, but it was really, really tight. There were some people in the bench that weren't part of our family and they were kind of upset and were squeezing us tighter. I finally got up and went back to that other section.
