 I'm in a station wagon by the Greasepit near the adjacent restaurant's parking lot. With me are two people: Mave from my music class and another guy I don't know. We have a box full of stuff, at the bottom of which are a lot tickets to Broadway shows! They can be sold for hundreds to thousands of dollars. I'm not sure how we got them. They are either stolen or lost and found or received for free. I'm not sure if we should keep them, as is Mave. But I want to keep them. <br/
