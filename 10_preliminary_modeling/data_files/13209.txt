I was at this library place. I was trying to decide what movie to watch. When I got home some of the movies were different. Mulholland Dr. was one of them. Calvin was around. I had this Little Britain DVD and Andy was on the front. We were going to watch something. Ezra had three dogs. Mom bought them all last week. I had known about the first one and I said that I wanted a dog and she said we'd go to the shop tomorrow, which was a Thursday. People were performing plays at this theater and we could perform ours in front of all these people. Evelyn sat next to me on this lounge and I was telling her about the dogs. Calvin sat down and Genevieve was trying to get him to leave.
