I dreamed that I had never been on ice skates before until this particular night. I put on a pair of skates and began to glide across the ice. It wasn't long before I was able to do difficult twists and turns and pivots. I seemed to be alone in this rink until all of a sudden a man appeared, waving a piece of paper. He wanted me to be the star at his fee show.
