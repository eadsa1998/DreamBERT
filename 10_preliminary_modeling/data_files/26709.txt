 I'm with a group of people who have just come off a boat. It's a hot sunny day. Our guide says we'll fry out in the hot sun before long. We have come in to wash and eat lunch. Before we eat everyone washes. I lather my entire body with soapsuds. We're on a boating/diving trip, and have come in to rest. I'm at a party that has a similar feeling to the group I was just with. Friends from high school are there. They and I have both changed. My friend Elise Rooks is there. My ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas walks in, wearing what look like high black leather boots that extend to her upper calf. I see this, having no particular positive or negative reaction, other than to think people change. She comes in and I see she is actually wearing long black fuzzy socks with black sandals that have colorful straps. I think these are from her study abroad in Germany. They seem to be a little more consistent with Annie as I know her, than the boots. She walks by me. I sit on a couch or chair with my elbows on my knees. I don't look up: playing coy. She walks past and touches my left hand and fingers. I say, "Hey Chief..." My friend Esther Thurman is sitting across from me. We've not seen each other in a long time. She sees me and starts a conversation with her usual enthusiastic greeting. I'm mellow, and reply. I have a plate of shredded carrots and processed cheese that I eat. I'm fairly comfortable around these people though we've changed. I'm very mellow. I notice the changes in others more so than in myself.
