We were at a shop and they had this 'game' where you had to crawl along these blocks, most of which were high up and in the air and you had to balance, and it was an Are You Afraid of the Dark game (I don't know why it was called that). Dad, Ezra and I were on it. Ezra went ahead and then I got in front of Dad. Ezra was going to some creepy religious thing and the people had these things on their heads that made it look like they had no faces. We had been on this before, and they had changed this bit where you have to get ice and now only people tall enough could get it. There were DVD sets on display of Are You Afraid of the Dark, which were coming out soon. I went to another shop later with Mom and they had giant ice-cream sandwiches and they were back to normal. Jeremiah was somewhere and he said he was going to marry this girl who liked some other guy.
