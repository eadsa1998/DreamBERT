 I'm in a hotel room on the bottom bunk of bunk beds. My friend Emily Zates is there, wearing big dark sunglasses. She is in between the glass doors in the library at Brimson, talking on the phone. There are other people near me. My friends Tiny Combs and Marge Drummond are there. My roommate Jens Nils is in the background. I can tell Emily doesn't see us at first. Finally, she does see us. We joke about butt sex. Marge has a big patch of dark hair on her butt. I see it when she rolls over.
