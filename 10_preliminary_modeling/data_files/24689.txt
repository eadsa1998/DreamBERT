I got a homework reminder in my mailbox. I don't know what it was for. "Basic Strategies" - what? I dialed 509: "Hello, (illegible)," I said. "Yeah," she said, "I'll meet you and we will talk about what you are supposed to do." "OK," I said. I went to the library and there were cookies all over the table. I ate a bunch of them. Then I went to the girls bathroom, and the boys were there. I told them they didn't belong there and they got out. Setting: Bathroom, library, My school, Tom's room. Characters: Boys in bathroom, Marilyn (I know). Feelings and Thoughts: Weird. I felt weird because the boys went into our bathroom.
