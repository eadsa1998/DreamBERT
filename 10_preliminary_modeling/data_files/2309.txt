I am at the old M City house, sitting on the front yard, near the bad corner so close to the road I nearly get run over. I see Darryl coming up to the door and I follow him, asking, "Why did you leave me?" He can't answer. We go inside and I see all the furniture is different. The piano's in the dining room and the fireplace is on the wrong wall. I see my parents, who smile at me. I walk through the dining room and see the "pool room" now transformed into a sweet, pretty sitting room, frilly curtains, china, another fireplace. The kitchen is different too. I look into the stairwell and then return to the living room. Charla follows me. I see Darryl seated in an overstuffed chair and I sit on his lap and Charla joins us. Darryl starts to explain how he tried to come back for me. I feel pulled in two directions: toward Charla (the present or the future) and toward Darryl (the past).
