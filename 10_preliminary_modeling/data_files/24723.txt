Well, I remember two teenagers, I guess they were my brother and sister because our father gave us each four million dollars. I remember the girl saying that that was not enough, but our father had already gone. Our house was on an island and when the boy went out on his boat two sharks chased him and he ended up on the shore, in the arms of the police. The whole time, the girl was smiling, then she sailed over to a cave in a big rock, and that was the last I saw of her. I remember buying a sweatshirt with my four million dollars. Actually, I did see the girl. She was walking in with me from when I had bought my sweatshirt. Then I saw her again, sitting on the couch, talking to our dad. Setting: On an island. Our house was the only thing on the island so it wasn't very big. Characters: The teenage girl (my sister in the dream) started out being my cousin, but then she changed and was someone I didn't know. Our dad in the dream was my real father, and my brother was someone I didn't know. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, worried, hate. Well, I was happy most of the time, but when my brother was chased by sharks, I was worried and hated my sister. After that, I was happy again.
