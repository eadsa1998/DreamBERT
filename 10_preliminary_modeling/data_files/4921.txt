["Fire."] I am in a room. I am very tired. I need to prepare a speech. I don't want to but feel I need to. I get up to prepare. Someone says there is a forest fire. Apparently I am in California. I go outside to look. I walk on a path along the river. The water is still and shallow. I say the water is low as it is California. Hope there will be enough water to put out the fire. I walk on and look into the forest. Someone had gone in there and reports that the fire is coming but it is a long way away. I am concerned and want to prepare to be safe.
