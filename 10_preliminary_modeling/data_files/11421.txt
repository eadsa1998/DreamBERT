Again, this is a dream occurring just before waking in the morning as it was probably quite flexted to my will. I am in the American army and we are again at war with Germany. I am captured and imprisoned somewhere in Germany. I escape and most of the dream consists of my eluding the Germans, trying to use my one year of German effectively. Among the escapades, I resort to wounding my face with a piece of glass so as to disfigure my face making me unrecognizable. I come back to America in the uniform of a German soldier who I killed to get his clothes and paper (America is conquered). Here I act as the soldier and am able to reside at home where I try to help my family and aid the underground.
