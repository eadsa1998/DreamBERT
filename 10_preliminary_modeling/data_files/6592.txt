On a Chinese boat, unusual plan. Chinese woman cook gives me quarters. I am bothered because it is only a corner, no separate room. She gives me bedpan. I see a narrow passage at side of boat. Two children, about 2 and 4, are there. The younger, an English child wears a pinafore. Their mothers are upstairs. Then I am teaching. Looking for classroom. Find 4-2. Small class. I ask them, "Is this the class that has no teacher?" "I am to teach you." Look at program. Read B. Arith . A reading . Call B class and go to another class for lesson. Send class to black board which is on almost worn-off plaster. Children  start work. First question is, "Imagine a goose, a kangaroo. Draw them." Class is in alcove. Two boys disappear. A class returns. I call for the two boys, get no response.
