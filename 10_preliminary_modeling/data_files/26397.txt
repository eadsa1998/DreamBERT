 I'm with my friend Emily Zates and another woman, who seems like our friend Esther Thurman, but isn't. We are at Fly Lake in the Big Resort Area. We're going to camp. They are swimming. I want to swim naked. I feel that I should be all natural here. We need to move our gear off the portage in case other people come. We're in a church-like building. I go pick up a load of our gear and move it, and go to tell the others. I walk into a very solemn, church-like ceremony. It seems like a performance.
