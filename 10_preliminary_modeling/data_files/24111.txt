I was at home and we had family over partying. I was holding my cousin Bob (10 months old) and when I was playing with him, his nose started to bleed so I took him to the restroom to wipe his nose with a warm cloth, and after I wet the cloth I turned to him and his mouth was full of blood and I started to get scared. Then I tilted down his head to drain out the blood and cleaned him up and took him back to his aunt.
