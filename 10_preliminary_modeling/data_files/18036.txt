We went on a plane. Then it landed and there were a bunch of poor people not having fun on the plane except us and they wanted to learn about animals (the poor people) and we found some beavers in a pond, so we jumped in attracting their attention so they could see them and they all came over and said "wow" and then they watched them for like and hour and we just started swimming in the pond with the beavers and then we found an otter and I got to keep it.
