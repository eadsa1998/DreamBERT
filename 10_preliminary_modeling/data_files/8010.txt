I went to the BE Retreat Center for an appointment with Sister Toni. As I was walking in I realized I had left my planner in the car and would need it to schedule my next appointment. I turned around to go back to my car and I couldn't remember where I had parked. the parking lot was different than in waking life. There were three rows for parking. I couldn't remember the correct row or position in the row. I guess I just decided to forget it and go on in. I entered the building and was waiting in Sister's office for my appointment. Various people came in and out. Susan J was there. She was laying in the fetal position, facing the wall, in a corner of the room by the desk. I was sitting at the desk at this point. She was crying and very upset. Someone told me that someone close to her had recently died. I recognized the name, though I don't remember the name actually being used in the dream. I said, No wonder she is so upset. Still I could not recall her relationship with this person, only that she had been very close to him. It was a male. I knew it was not her husband. I questioned if it might have been her brother or her son. Her daughter also came to mind, but I think only to help me place Susan J's son. Doctor W came in the office. He saw me but did not say a word, acknowledge me, or anything. He simply laid something on the desk, turned, and walked out. I was so relieved as I did not want to have any kind of uncomfortable exchange with him.
