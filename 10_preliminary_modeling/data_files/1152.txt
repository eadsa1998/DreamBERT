I am teaching a young girl princess to act. The scene is a couch. It's a seduction scene. I tell her that the night before a performance, I go to the theatre and look at the stage and visualize the performance. The girl asks me if I like her. I say, "Yes." I do like her. She is glad because she thought I didn't. We're done rehearsing and we start back. She rides with me in a go-cart wheelchair. We come to some stairs. I say, "We have to get out and walk down the stairs." Then I say, "Wait here, I have to go talk to someone." I ask permission to talk to Jim E. His secretary says, "O.K., but his assistant is with him." I say, "Fine." I go in. They (he and his wife), are in the process of going bankrupt (his wife's business). As I listen to them, I think, "Why didn't I do it that way?," (Jim E had suggested that each salesman be given part payment in cash). I don't remember why I want to talk to him.
