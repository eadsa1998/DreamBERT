I was at the apartment, though the building I was in looked more like my maternal Grandma Jane's house.  I got up from the bed and found the small fridge I had in the dorm- we had forgotten completely that we had it.  Inside I found fake chicken and several bottles of some sort of yellow liquid, lemonade or soda.  Then I went in to the dining room table.  My parents' cat Buster came and trotted up surprisingly quickly given his age and state. He had something that looked like a small version of my baby blanket around him.  I was worried for a moment that it was my blanket. He reared up and put his front paws on the dining room table and spoke.  He asked me about springs on the table.  He was looking for them for some reason.  I was only sort of surprised that he was talking, but I did note it, slightly surprised because it 'wasn't even a dream'.  Then I sat in the gold chair in the living room, holding him.  Someone came to the front door, which was open.  They thought I was my mother and asked if I (Madeleine) was here yet.  I said I was but that my mother had gone out for something.  I mentioned that Buster was talking.
