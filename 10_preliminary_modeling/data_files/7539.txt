We are together in a room where I am looking at some papers. Mary and I come together, hug and kiss. But she's smoking a cigarette and the smoke bothers me terribly and I quickly move away from her. I comment that I wish she'd stop smoking -- I think she laughs and says something to the effect that she'd love to, but she just can't.
