I dreamt I was in a large auditorium and I was speaking to someone, a male, and I was rather distraught about the place this auditorium was and the type of people that were going to be in there. They were people from Hialeah and I was describing to this person, whoever I was, about the average person from Hialeah, how skuzzy they are and how I didn't like their being around this type of person that was from Hialeah.
