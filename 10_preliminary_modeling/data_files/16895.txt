I'm on a mission to deliver something to an office. I have a laptop and papers. I'm on the side of a busy road. There's snow on the verge. I hide the laptop in a 'flap' in the snow and go down to a business park and up into a large glass and steel building. Then I realize that I've left my laptop behind. Then I panic, and go back but I can't find it.
