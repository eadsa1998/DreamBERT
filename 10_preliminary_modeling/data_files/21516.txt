Fisher and I were driving. We were in the city, then hit the country. I asked him if he wanted to drive and he took the wheel for a while. Then we stopped because Fisher didn't want to drive on awhile on account of a muddy drive. He turned off and we came to a nice paved road. I took the wheel. I put on my shoes and we were on our way. I met my uncle and cousins. I stopped by a liquor store and John, my cousin, and two friends gave me a half pint of liquor for a gift. I thanked him for it. I lived in PA. The neighbor's toilet outside was running over, overflowing nad down the alley. It was filthy. I had a loaf of bread and the flies would land on it and I had to break a hunk of it off and throw it away. As I walked thru the field, I stepped into cow flops and had my shoes all over it. I walked thru the grass ti get it off and clean. We had a lot of tomatoes growing.
