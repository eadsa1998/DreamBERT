Last night I saw in our kitchen, upon the wall behind the stove, a mechanism such as is used in railroad stations to announce trains, a frame of stained wood supporting about twenty reversible slats, arranged in two columns. All but the lowest in the right hand series showed an unmarked black surface, the last, however, bore in white letters the strange word "zikery."
