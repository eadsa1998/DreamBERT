I have an acquaintance, Mark, who offered me a job which I declined. He turned out to be very respectable and has a clear perspective on many issues we are both interested in. I don't know him too well but consider him to be a reliable and trustworthy friend. Through the course of our discussions he has made mention of his homosexuality. I know very few gay men, and have not an iota of respect for the majority of them. Mark is different, in my perspective, though. I had this dream, last night, though. I was meeting Mark and we decided, mutually, to meet at his house. He opened the door wearing a very feminine fake-silk robe with a chiffon collar. This didn't scare me; it pissed me off. I controlled my anger and told him, forthright, that I didn't find his attire appropriate to the occasion, which was just a social meeting to talk about current happenings in our lives -- specifically, his lover just left him, and my lover, who is a heterosexual female to compliment my heterosexual maleness has recently left me. I told him, straightforth, that I was not going to have sex with him . . . "So go change your clothes, or I'll be leaving and we can keep things between us on a professional level." End of dream.
