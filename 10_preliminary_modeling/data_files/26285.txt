 I'm in a bedroom that seems to be my friend Kevin Simpson's new room at his house. It's night and the house is dark. I hear a door close downstairs: someone has entered. My high school classmate Wyatt Belzer has entered despite the door being locked with a dead bolt. I know this and I yell out loud to him. We communicate. He has broken in. I want to protect myself. I have a blank handgun and there are two bullets on the floor next to the bed. The door to the bedroom is open. I groggily take the gun, load it with a bullet, and point it at the door for protection. I fall asleep. I wake up and person seems to be there in the darkness. I struggle to open my eyes and move. My slight movements are slow and weak like a baby's, even though I try with all my energy to kick the man in the room and move. I am essentially paralyzed. The person that is in the room is a black man with long dread locks. I can distinguish the outline of his head in the darkness. I try with all my might to move, but cannot. I am scared and want protection. I don't feel safe with the man here. (I may realize just prior to awakening that the profile of the head of the man is the outline of my hand. I realize this either as I awaken, or just before I awaken)
