First of all I dreamt that I was watching "The Little Mermaid" and there was more to it than just the story that they had. And as per usual, my mind keeps making up more details. I dreamt that Triton and Ursula were doing it, and that's how he got all his princess daughters, and that Ursula was their mother. And after she had Aquada (the eldest mermaid in the movie), Triton took her to the, some meeting somewhere to kind of show her how things were done. And she was talking to like a teenager. And then the scary part was when she had Ariel and Triton had Ariel and they came to the part of the movie where he destroyed her human treasures. Instead of singing "Part of That World," she sang "Bluebird." And then the movie ended. And I, oh my gosh. And once Mom was up in my room and there was this dinosaur soap that had broken in half and we called it a bluebird soap, and it wasn't really scary. And then I differentiated between the bluebird tape and the bluebird soap. [laugh] That was kind of funny actually. And then she put on this really pretty dress and decided she was going to go to the store, and I told her, "Well, wait a minute. How in the world am I going to do this without you?" because I was getting ready to record something, I don't remember what. And she said, "We'll do it as soon as I get back," and I was like, "Yeah, right." And then the scariest part. I dreamt that Halloween witch could record people's voices, and it recorded somebody saying, "If you want to have a dream in the category of "pushed or drawn to danger," just turn on the radio and play "Bluebird" and you'll have your own.
