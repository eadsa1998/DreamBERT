 I'm in Grandpa and Grandma Redding's house. My brother Wally gives me fellatio and strokes my erection. My erection goes through a portion of the back of the orange recliner that we have at the Whitman House. As he strokes it, I ejaculate bit by bit, in spurts. My erection extends out from my body, more than upward. I ejaculate onto Wally. My cousins Anna Strange, and either Bertha Strange or Archie Weber are there. They may laugh at this. It is later that night. I wake up at 4:30am. I want to masturbate, and to give Wally fellatio, to make him ejaculate. He is sleeping on a nearby couch. I am thirsty. I go to the kitchen to get water. All the lights are off. I wonder if the other relatives have arrived since I've been sleeping. I turn a light on. It is not a kitchen light, but a living room light. People in the living room stir and moan. I see that several people are on the couches: Anna, Bertha, my uncle Dannie Redding, and others. I try to shut the light off, fiddling with different switches. Anna gets mad at me. I say I hit the wrong switch. I'm glad I know that others are around. Now I know I can't masturbate or find Wally to make him ejaculate, because people are there. It's a good thing I know.
