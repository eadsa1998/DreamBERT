I was walking just inside the border at Canada, north of Seattle, on the U.S. side.  I saw the line of the border on the ground.  It was night, very dark.  I wondered if I could just walk over the line into Canada, if I would be apprehended or shot.  I didn't know how easy you could cross into Canada.  I got to the coast.  I thought I should be smelling peat moss.  I looked out, from what seemed like slitted windows, like a ship or plane or UFO would have.  It was hard to see.  Next to whatever I was on, out in the ocean, I saw a big rolling old ship or something.  It would roll way over on its side, out with the wave, then it would roll in to the other side and nearly hit us.  It did this very slowly, over and over.  I was astounded, entranced, it was so big.  It came so dangerously close to hitting us.  I wondered if we or it was rigged just so precisely with measurements to keep either ship from hitting each other.  Then I wondered if it was the ship I was on that was rolling side to side, not the one I watched.  It was hard to tell if we were rolling or the other ship.  And it was hard to look out those slitted windows.
