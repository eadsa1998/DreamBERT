I was examining an object in the middle of an intersection that resembled the corner nearest to the house I lived in located in North Floral Park, N.Y. My mother came from the direction of our house. I guessed that she had spoken to the neighbor with whom we were not on speaking terms about the object. She explained something to me about the object, and then she passed me and walked on in the same direction.
