It was the middle of the night and a helicopter landed on Cassandra's house. I think that I felt like the reason why they did is because they had some kind of emergency and they couldn't go any further, so then like emergency landed on Cassandra's house. Then a plane emergency landed on our house, because the plane had to rescue whoever was in the helicopter. [laugh] And it was kind of funny because we all thought it was going to be bad and, you know, when the plane landed on our house, it kind of knocked a few boards loose, but it didn't really flatten the house like sometimes we say it will. I'm trying to think. And it was a general scene where all of us were up kind of late, it was past 11:00 or 12:00 at night, and I think it was like one other person, it was one of the first nights Mom and Dad were back in town. And I think Dad was talking on the phone and Mom was doing something like shuffling papers on the dining room table. And I was up late, I was watching something on TV. And then I don't remember what happened ______ but next thing I knew it was Halloween and I didn't have like the stuff set up like I usually do. Oh, I know, part of this was when we were up late, I was on the porch, and it was another one of those dreams where we listened to the boom box and I couldn't shut it off when I realized that Mom &amp; Dad were home. And I couldn't even take the batteries out. It was the funniest thing. And so I turned it all the way down and it still could be heard. And then the next thing I knew, it was Halloween and I didn't have my stuff set out like I usually do. And I was upstairs digging some more stuff out, and next thing I knew, the doorbell rang, and it was people {trick-or-treaters} and you know how you give each people two things of candy in their bag _______________, well this kid said, "No, I want a big one like my brother; I want a blue one." And I said, "Okay, I don't think I have one, but you can look." And he looked and looked, "No, you don't have one." And so I said, "Well, have a good _____," and he left. And that's all I think there was to it.
