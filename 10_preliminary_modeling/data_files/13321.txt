I was at a meeting and I said that I had faked some girl's death (the girl looked like Portia de Rossi). I was in my room and I thought I heard someone so I closed the door. These people tried to get in and I was sitting with my back against the door with my feet pressing against the bedside table. I text Mom to come over and help. Eventually I yelled at the people and told them to leave me alone and come back another day. They went. Then my room was a motel room. I looked outside and saw that the people had been cops. Someone else then tried to get in and they were bad guys. I screamed and tried to get the cops attention. I managed to open the door and ran past this little white guy (the rest were black). They started coming after me and I was jumping down these stairs. I met with this girl who I followed into her motel room. It was discovered that I could change other people's appearance. There was a cat outside and it hissed so we decided to run, but the people came. It was just a friend of hers, but it was actually a bad guy who had disguised herself. I was changing people. One girl ended up pink and slimy. I accidentally changed this guy to a big, muscly guy and then I changed him into a hunchback, which was permanent. The girl (who was called Renee) said that Ezra, Dad and I needed to leave because they would come. I was telling Mom. This guy was disguised as Ezra's friend. We poked him in the gut? Before we left Ezra and I were playing Pokemon.
