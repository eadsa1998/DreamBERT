As J. and I leave the hotel, father tells us to be sure to phone La Grange. J. does. I have a book and my handbag and wonder about the rest of our baggage. Oh it is all in the car. J. is annoyed because they want us to do too much, e.g. a nine-mile hike. I ask if we shouldn't go to eat. "Yes we three will go to a restaurant." "Three?" I say, "You and me and this one" and he points to an 18-year-old boy nearby.
