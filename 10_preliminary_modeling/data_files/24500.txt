I am in a large room at ground level. Its green walls and floors are made of smoothed out earth. Large square windows without glass overlook a forbidding no man's land. The NVA begin shooting. I return fire. They are everywhere. Several reach in. I push them off and continue shooting. They are everywhere, but I am not afraid. I keep fighting. There is no escape.
