I watched the sunrise. There were red flames and you could watch without hurting your eyes. I asked Mom if she had seen it and she said she hadn't. I had taken a photo. Darren was there. The house was like the old house. I was in the bathroom and Mom came in and she had extra rings on. They were silver diamond-y ones (like gangster's wear).
