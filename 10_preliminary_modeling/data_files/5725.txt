[1997-05-09] All I could remember was 2 women walking with me somewhere and giving me some assistance and then we were in a car, I was in the front seat with them, there were four people in the front seat, 1 person to my left and 2 women to my right. I remember thinking "that's odd, there's 4 people in the front seat and there seems to be room for all of us."
