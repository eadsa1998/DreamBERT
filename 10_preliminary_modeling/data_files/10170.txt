We are at the home of friends from the Art School (where Frank teaches); their house is very luxurious and has two bathrooms, But I am told that the plumbing does not work.... Shift: a man from Church tells us that he has applied for a job as Director of a Language Center, which would imperil Frank's job; I am surprised and sad, then I walk barefoot through deep snow.
