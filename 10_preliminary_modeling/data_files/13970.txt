I had a sea lion. Poppa had something to do with it. We were moving it somewhere bigger. We were chucking it in the air and we could see a brown thing in the clouds and it moved in flashes. I showed Mom. I asked if it was going to go to her pool, but she said no as she was keeping the sea lion a secret. I don't know where it ended up. Later it was night and I went to the shop. This car stopped in my way and I had to get in. There were two guys in there and they asked me some questions. They then let me out, but there were these other guys. It was misty and one of them said "we like mist". I ended up in this weird town. This girl kidnapped us, but she had a shower and I escaped. This guy friend of mine had already escaped and I caught up with him. This Asian boy had raped this girl and was standing in this hut thing looking away from me. There was a spaceship thing and there were three guys. We all had to pair up. We were all in suits. I found this guy I had been looking for and we went into this capsule and got sent to the ground. He was then Peter Weller, and I didn't think he was going to survive, but he did.
