I was at Mom's, which was different, and in my room. I decided to put pictures of hot guys on my wall. I had these pictures in my diary and they were of Michael Palin and James Spader but also one of Terry Jones. The wall I was going to put them on was in my cupboard. I left to do something and when I came back Mom was in there looking around. I was then taking them down and they were blu-tacked there.
