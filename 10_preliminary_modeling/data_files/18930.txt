I was walking with a friend (male, same age) and we were on a sea wall looking down at the sand and water. We saw several crocodiles (or alligators) on the sand. We walked on further and we came to a dredged spillway for water. It was dry. I walked out in the middle and it filled up with water. The water was about knee deep. Then we walked back along the sea wall, and I could see another smaller crocodile inside the big one as if it had been swallowed, except for its head which was in the mouth of the big crocodile.
