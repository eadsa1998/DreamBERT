I am cleaning out a refrigerator. I tell Howard that I'll do the house work stuff for the first two days of spring vacation and then I'll write for the rest of the time. He starts an argument about how I spoiled some sales of our furniture. He lectures me on how much each expensive piece of furniture cost him. I go to the table and set it for the children. They are noisy and hide the glasses. I wonder why I'm doing the housewife mother job again. I think, "I don't like this."
