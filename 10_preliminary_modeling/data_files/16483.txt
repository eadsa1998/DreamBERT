Some relatives were in town, and I think it was Aunt Janice and Uncle Larry and Uncle Charlie and Aunt Polly, and it was Christmas time. And we were doing something downtown and I think Samantha, Sandra and Derek were there, in addition to these other people. And we were going around downtown and doing stuff, and there was some kind of exhibit show in the Coliseum and we were walking around. And then there was supposed to be a Celine Dion concert like the Las Vegas show, and apparently because it wasn't making too much money up there, it had to tour and it had to come down and go to another place. And so I was thinking, "Oh, man, we don't even have to pay 80 bucks to get it; we're already in." And Mom's like, "Well, I don't know, we've got people to go do stuff with and we don't know what they're doing and what their plans are" and stuff. And so we went outside and we started walking down the road and then I found out that Mom and Dad had bought two tickets for the concert for Christmas for me, and so we went back in, and Mom kept stalling and stalling doing different things, and finally we got in and we got to our seats. And this heavy metal guitar person opened for her, and then when it was her turn to come out and take the stage, they pulled down a movie screen and I found out it wasn't going to be a concert. They were going to show a horror movie that she starred in. And I was like, "What!?"
