I was in command of a canoe leaving a port. The men under me did as I told them to do, but grudgingly. Once away from the view of higher authorities, they all abandoned the canoe and finally hid it. They played around the pool or lake swimming, diving, etc., while I stood an the edge and yelled at them. They wouldn't listen. However, one finally brought the canoe back, but they still wouldn't get back in and row away as I tried to make them do. I was aware that thecanoe was a reddish brown.
