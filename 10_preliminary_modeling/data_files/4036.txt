["Forgot my nightgown"]  I am sleeping. It is the middle of the night and I wake up, although I am still groggy. I sit up and notice that a group of family members are sitting around a campfire on the other side of camp talking. I realize I need to get up and join them. I stumble out of my bed and go there, rubbing my sleepy eyes. I am having a hard time keeping them open. Now we are going for a ride in a cousin's car. I get to drive. Michael J. Fox is my friend and sits on my left. He drapes him arm over me in friendly closeness. I am seated like I'm in the backseat, only it is the only seat and the steering wheel is there. I laugh and comment that most of the car is in the front end, but I am surrounded by my loved ones here at the back. I see the fancy set of pedals to operate the car with. It is a golden bronze color. We start to travel. I realize suddenly with a gasp that I had forgotten to pack my nightgown and maybe a few other things I need.
