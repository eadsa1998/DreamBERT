I was working and was going out after lunch to a store. I made a long jump on to a fence and then went over. I had a job. It seemed I was a guard or something. I was lying on top of a covered high tank and watching. I saw people running down the road. I didn't know why I was in a car going at a high rate of speed, sitting in the back and watching the one man especially running down the street. Then I looked ahead and noticed no one was driving my car. I was in it alone and a black horse was standing in the road blocking it. A policeman was holding on to his rein trying to pull him off, but he wouldn't budge. I applied my brakes and started to slow down and I saw someone turn a sprinkling hose towards the horse and he finally moved off the road. I heard someone say he was the Thastle Down Star. I looked at a board that had printing of him, so I could see the name of the horse, but awoke before I could see it. I was drinking whiskey. A friend poured me a beer glass about _ full and I drank most of it. Then gave Ed J. the rest. Then I drank a bottle of beer. There were small screws on the floor that I made and I was sort of skating or rolling on them with my feet. I seemed to be perched up so high on a seat or something and when I was coming down, I told one of the fellows that we are getting higher by the day. I was nervous when I was getting down from the height. I was in a shoe store. Denny C. was asking me if I wanted to buy a pair of shoes and I said I had enough shoes now. Then I was sitting with some people at the Bailey shoe dept. When the clerks came in to wait on us, I told the clerks who was ahead of me and then I told them that a cheap shoe was just a cheap shoe. There was no sale on good shoes. I got talkative. I said a man's shoe that is less than $14 was a cheap shoe. I told them if a woman pays $4 for a pair of shoes, she is buying a cheap shoe. She must pay $8 or more to get a good shoe.
