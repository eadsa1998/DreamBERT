There was a holocaust happening on the 21/3/05 (the day before the Green Day concert) and it did. Bombs fell from the sky and the house was getting destroyed and then me and a heap of others were in space and then these aliens put us in this big spaceship. There were lots of people. Ezra and I were together, but we couldn't find Dad. The alien explained that 2000 years ago something happened and it would cause a holocaust on this day. They had being trying to stop it since. I was worried about not seeing the Green Day concert and my stuff and the pets. Then they said that little brothers could come and pick a dog for the family. I walked off for a second and Ezra came back with a big brown puppy. I said to call it Chico and Ezra said that it was a gay name. I also complained that it was a big dog and that he should've gotten a smaller one. Then I saw Mom and Darren and they had a black and white dog. I told them to call it Chico. Then Ezra said "I thought ours was Chico". I was upset because I hadn't known whether Mom and Dad were alive or not.
