I had a complex dream. I was traveling back to the Coast to see someone important (the kids, I think). I kept trying to think of the name of the place. City X didn't fit; State Y seemed appropriate. I was traveling first by plane, then by train and then on foot. I remember dreaming saying, "I'm in a Peyote dream" I kept meeting E City people, all warm and strong.
