My dream was in a gym and it was soft flooring. There were big red place mats on each side of the room. We were all wearing white socks, colorful t-shirts and shorts. There was about 20 people in the gym and so we decided to play a game. Everyone went to a team. One team was on one of the red mats and the other team on the other red mat. One person out of each team went into the middle of the gym with a ball. Then their teammates would have to do something (can't remember) and the two people in the middle of the gym would throw the balls to people, and then I woke up.
