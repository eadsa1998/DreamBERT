I dreamed that my boyfriend and I had quarreled because I was late for an appointment we had. He had told me to meet him in the park at 7 p.m. and I was half an hour late. We argued a lot for this reason and we finally broke up and he told me that he didn't want to see me any more or talk to me. But a few days later we saw each other and talked to each other, but from opposite sides of the street. The thing was that I didn't understand what he told me and he didn't understand what I said. Then I don't remember what else I dreamed.
