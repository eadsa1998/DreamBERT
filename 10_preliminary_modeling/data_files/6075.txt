I remember being with this girl named Mary that I have not seen since 6th grade. We were rushing to catch a plane! And for some reason, the airport looked like a shopping mall! We were lost for a bit until this guy helped me find my way and he also carried my luggage! He got us to our gate in time to check in. I remember grabbing my bag from him and running  to the gate! Then as we checked in, we still had some time before takeoff! So I turned around to thank the guy, but he was gone! So we went back to the mall part to look for him. I do not remember if we found him, but I do remember the reason for Mary and me to have to take this trip together. It was the result for getting an "F" in either an exam or paper from Dr. [illegible]! It was a big red "F" on the top of my first page!
