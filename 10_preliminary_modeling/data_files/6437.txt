We were back in my parents' house: me, Laura, and one of her friends. We were hanging out in my old room; we had brought some stuff in and were preparing to clean it and some other things out. One of these things was a black backpack with a book on 'Black Magic' in it. Inside this book -- rather, on top of it, between the covers -- was a huge mass of yellowish-brown chunky material. I knew this to be 'human remains', and it was somehow associated with the Ku Klux Klan and racist politicians. It was something I had found in the house. <br/
