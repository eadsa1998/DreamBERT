["Slaves."] I am a slave and so are people like me. We are forced to lower ourselves into glass containers buried up to their tops in the earth. The containers are filled with some oily liquid. We must spend our days in those containers trying not to slip under and drown. We are starving and the other people walk past us insulting us and harming us. This feels like it goes on forever and I am exhausted and beaten down.
