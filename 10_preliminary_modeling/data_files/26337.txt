 I walk to the Oval Chapel at Brimson with others, including my classmate Greg Karn. We talk about our classmate Jenn Masters. Jenn's boyfriend is with us. Greg thinks Jenn is attractive. I go into the chapel with my friend Gino Teavor. Gino's mother Eleanor and my mom wait outside the chapel. The preacher gives a sermon involving clapping and singing. It's a terrible sermon. He talks about my old classmate Tim Spade's article on the IP, which he doesn't like. The preacher is a dictator: very authoritative. Two young men arrive late and approach the preacher, explaining they've come late because they handed in their paper to a recycling bin, and had to print it out again. The preacher is unforgiving. I think this whole scene with the preacher is a worthless hoax. I get up and leave, squeezing by a fat woman as I exit the pew. When outside, I start walking towards someone who I think is my mom, but who is Marj Grant. I shake my head indicating what is occurring in the chapel is not a good scene. I walk towards the student union. There are some female professors and students doing Kung Fu outside it. I walk in, and I see my high school friends Mya Rousing and Sarah Reed sitting on bar stools at a high table. I walk to get my mail, not stopping. I can't walk normally: my movements are slow, and I realize I've experienced this before. Mya and my classmates from Brimson Sharon and Shelly Lincoln come running up to me like a bunch of adolescent girls. Mya is squealing, "No!" They're going to tell me that Mya has a crush on me. Finally, Mya asks me, "How do you feel about me?"
