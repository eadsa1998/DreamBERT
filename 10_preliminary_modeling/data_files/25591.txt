 There is a football game happening. There is a metal pool with water and fish in it. Some white colored fish are put in the pool as a distraction. There are other colored fish in the pool. There are two greasy mechanics there. My classmate Beth Wilder is there. Something happens with an apple pie. My sister Ramona is there. There is some poisonous cottage cheese there. My classmate Monique Thorble is out of breath at the football game. I give her CPR, including chest compressions. Another woman and I give Monique chest compressions as we walk her down the crowded stairs. There is a prisoner with handcuffs there. He walks back to his institution docilely instead of trying to flee. He must be out on parole or something. I leave Monique because her boyfriend is there. The stairs are crowded with a group of little kids. I try to intimidate the kids by standing and looking mean.
