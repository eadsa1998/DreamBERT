I had some MSN messages from Ezra asking some questions but the computer kept lagging majorly. I told him finally, that it was lagging and he told me to meet him at the zoo. He was on a small canoe boat thing with an animal. I had to buy a ticket to get a boat over to him. You had to drive it yourself. I think there was a train? I got back and had to show the lady the ticket. I was holding Gizmo and had to hand her over first to get the ticket out. I went back over to Ezra. Later, I parked outside of Mom's and called her to pick us up. On the radio they played some old song. Ezra mentioned something else and liking old music like Midnight Oil and they played some song which was the song "from From Dusk Till Dawn" or so we said. Mom was sound asleep. My notes aren't very detailed and I don't remember any of this next stuff. She forgot which way to go. There were two lanes to choose from and she chose the wrong one? There were escalators that were sideways. We had to lie down. There were some old ladies. There was a bakery thing with lemon meringue pie. This guy let me taste it to see if I liked it.
