I went to Comic-Con. I was watching people on stage, but I only remember seeing Eliza Dushku. I was trying to get to the break room before them, but it took me ages to get out. When I left the main room, there was a hall next to it and someone snuck out of it and it was Nathan Fillion. I got excited and I averted my eyes, but he noticed and he said he was in a hurry and called me 'Izzy'. I asked how he knew my name and it was because of my badge. He went through these doors and he said he had to be at a place in San Francisco and I said 'ok, have a good a time' and he left and I was annoyed. I met with Ezra on the way to the car, but it took us a while to find it. Spaceman was in the back of a Ute in a box. There was a bad drawing of a house I'd done on Facebook and people were liking it. Nana had a gift but there was no reward?
