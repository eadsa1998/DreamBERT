I'm in a nice old house that's mine (but am I renting?) by myself and it has big rooms and a big yard and a garage. I've just come in and some other people have left - I go to the bedroom, which has a big window with curtains. There's a bum outside the window who comes right next to it and lays down as if to sleep there. (He knows I see him.) I'm uneasy about this. There are other such people in the back yard. I think they have business like they're helping build something maybe. I get up and (close the curtains?) go to find the phone book so I can call the landlord and tell him about this and ask what to do. But I can't find the number - he's unlisted. I know we got hold of him before, me and a friend, when I moved in, but that was through somebody else - a relative or something. I'm going to try, though. I go to the front of the house for something - to answer the door? And come back through the bedroom, noticing how big it is - the house isn't great big, but the rooms are. I go to the window and look out, checking to see if the bums are watching. I'm getting down on my stomach to peek under the curtain and see if the one guy is still lying there, and he is. I'm a little disturbed. However,somewhere I'm looking at earrings and thinking, "I'm really going to get my ears pierced, today!" And I'm thrilled about it - I feel my ears and imagine how it will hurt for a bit and then how it will feel to have earrings in, and how I can get long, dangly, neat ones. (Frankly, I think I'm in the same house, same scene, but I don't know how.)
