 There is a "Superboy" character. I may be him. I am a captive of a bad army-like group. They take me to their fortress. I pick up change on the way. The bad leader kicks me because he's annoyed that I'm picking up change. The fortress is all locked up. A dumb guard escorts another man and me. We fool him and escape. I swing on staircases and jump down to a lower level. I go down to a basement area where I find a number of captives in a room. They can come and go in secret because they have a key to the door outside their cell. One of the leaders of these captives is black. I think of oppressed black people. It is like the movie Hogan's Heros. The prisoners are undermining the captors.
