I was at the opera with my friend Rachel and someone else. Our seat was 40D. I remember thinking how underdressed I was because no one told me we were going to the opera. We asked an usher where our seat was and he said just keep walking, the aisle merges right. When we got to row 40 I turned around and Rachel and the other person had disappeared and I couldn't find them anywhere.
