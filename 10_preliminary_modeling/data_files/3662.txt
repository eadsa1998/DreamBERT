I am busy doing things and then Archie comes up to me. I think we are outdoors walking down a sidewalk. He hugs me enthusiastically and twirls me around so strongly my feet leave the ground and I am flying perpendicular to the ground. He reminds me that the dance performances are tonight (Tuesday) and hopes to see me there. I had forgotten and there was something else I planned to do that night. So I readjust and fit it into my plans. I go to the building and wander around the halls until I find the right room. I notice I am now wearing my old bikini style swimsuit. My legs and stomach are thin and nice-looking but my breasts are quite huge and the top of the swimsuit is partly undone and the breasts keep sort of falling out under the halter top. I keep trying to fix it so I'm not so exposed. I go in and people are preparing their individual spaces and props for their performance. I look around to find the right spot to put mine. I choose one place and then decide it's too much in the way of traffic and move it to another area. I lay out a couple of bunches of bananas in an artful way and hope no one comes along and takes a banana to eat; it will ruin the composition I made. Now I leave to go back and do what I had already planned, intending to return in time to do the performance. Now I can't find the van. I can't remember where I parked it. I am outside in the parking lot. I see what might be my van, but it turns out to be a station wagon with some hippie man on the top with all his wares spread out. I am relieved it isn't my van. I thought he was on my van. I see another vehicle, but it turns out not to be my van. I now am worried and annoyed with myself for not paying more attention to where I parked it. I go down a city street. No van.
