I was at university. I was in a computer lab or something like that, on a computer. This hot guy came in and I somehow found out that he was knowledgeable about programming. I asked him how to have a table with spry links and how to display results. He said he was in a rush but sat down and showed me. There was a mouse on the loose. I saw a rat and it had dried blood on it and then people said there was no rat but I could clearly see it -- it was a ghost. Mom made food and I went to shower. At first I was with a group of people but sometimes it was just Ezra. We were climbing across a scaffolding. Two people had to get there and they got a passport and went overseas to get away from some other guy. Once I got down I was walking and then I was in a car. A car stopped next to it and Ezra was in it. I waited for other cars and a police with sirens on came and then stopped on the corner. Then Ezra and I put on captain uniforms. Mine was dark blue and his was a lighter blue. We got in the car and changed into them. I ate and then they left. I hadn't gotten to park all the way up yet. I passed an electronics store with 20% of everything and Dad was like 'you should've bought a TV'. I went in and there were cheesecake slices for dessert and I stabbed this guy with a fork and then the police were on their way. Ezra and I cleaned the fork and fixed our uniforms up. I can't remember what happened but then I'd been downloading some game show. I watched an episode and Neil Patrick Harris and Matthew Perry were on it. It was from the early/mid 90s. Neil Patrick Harris was "noted for his wit" and they were actually really funny. Darren asked about my downloading and I said it was a freeleech and one of them was "from KG, not yours" and he was worried about ratio. I switched cameras and someone looked like Lydia. There was a Glee performance and I remember seeing Rachel and Finn.
