["Wild storm kills."] I am in a big house. I look out the window and see a hurricane funnel over the ocean coming toward the house. We are in danger. My "mom" and little sister go hide in the basement. Two elderly aunties go upstairs and my "dad" and young brother go outside on the porch. I can't decide where I should go to be safe. The storm is upon us. I hesitate, almost dash down to the basement and at the last moment dash upstairs. The two elderly aunties are lying in a bed moaning and groaning in fear. I run to the window. The sky is completely dark. I see a fireman being sucked out the front door through the window glass. I am sure he is dead. I realize that "Dad" and "brother" are dead. I see the sky clearing. The storm has passed. I survived it. I am sad because my "mom" and "sister" did not survive it.
