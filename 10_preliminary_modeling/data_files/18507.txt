There was a small half refrigerator and inside the door were 2 things for my father. One was cottage cheese and the other was an individual size container of Cool Whip--SUPERBRAND. I didn't know why my father had small individual servings. I had to go to the lake where relatives on my mom's side where having a family gathering. I did NOT want to go but I knew I had to. They were sitting on rocks at the river--which were covered with 3" of water from the river. It was surprisingly clear for a muddy river. I knew I had to leave and to come back. I had to walk in the shady woods with Dora and we passed a contraption, number 5, on the obstacle course. It was circular cross-country skiing. Dora was playing on it but something stopped her. It was a(n) arrogant fat man in a white shirt and said, "Can I take this apartment and take it down to the lake and bring it back." And Dora said, "Yes," so relaxed and calmly. I said, "But...." I was going to say, 'but it was my turn next.' But I knew I needed to swim at sunset. Swim hard back and forth across the lake to exhaust myself for all the aggression inside. I needed time alone from the relatives. Grandma and Grandpa and Aunt Bobbie and Uncle Bill had huge enlarged distorted eyes. I thought it meant they were going to die but I found out it was a botched obsolete eye operation they had had several years ago. There was a list of 5 phone numbers on a piece of paper. One number was 718-480-1188. One number was for Evelyn. One was for DORA. The circle of children from the family was sitting in the grass waiting to play. There were 7 heads of brown haired kids. I kept looking frantically for a blond-headed little girl. But Dora was not there. I was looking for her. The sun shined on my shoulders and I knew it was time for me to swim back and forth across the lake alone without talking to anybody.
