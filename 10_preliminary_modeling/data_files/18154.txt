The dream started out in my hometown at the art museum. I was standing sort of at the door to it at the top of the steps. There was a mail box there. The mailman who delivers our mail here came up to it and put some letters in the box. I started looking at them. Most of them were sort of advertising circulars. Somehow the scene changed while I was still looking at letters so that we were in a nearby college town in the apartment we first lived in after we got married. I was there with some old woman. She had just come because her suitcases were outside. My husband had gone off somewhere. My daughter was sleeping across the hall, not in what was our apartment. As a matter of fact, the room wasn't in that place in the real apartment. I was in the living room with this old woman in her 60's and she was sort of crotchety. I don't know who she was. She was some relative or other of mine or my husband. She was drinking tea. She asked me to please get her some more, so I did. The mailman apparently had gone around to the back of the house for something. There was another apartment back there and maybe he was delivering mail there. I went in to see if my daughter was waking up and he came in there and we started talking. It was real friendly conversation about something or other. We came back into our apartment. I brought back my daughter. We kept on talking and in this friendly way. I started wondering to myself exactly what his intentions were. What was he doing in here at all? What was I going to do? About the time I was thinking this, the old woman who now seemed to be something of a landlady, said, "Yes, it's always been so nice that the people living in the apartment have found such nice friends. I never heard anything unseemly going on and if anything unseemly goes on, the people go out."
