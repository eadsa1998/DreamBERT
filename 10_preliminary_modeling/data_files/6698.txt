I visit Simpson College and talk with head. Then I'm alone in an office. He comes in and asks, "Did they show you which desk to use?" " But I did not know I was to stay." "Yes, you'll teach Child Psychology from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m." Only two hours, I accept but think I must tell mother and H. in Cedar Rapids and Nola tomorrow. Will be her last day because I'm starting on Wednesday.
