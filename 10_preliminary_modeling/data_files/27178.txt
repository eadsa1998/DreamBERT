It was a rather large party--many people were there, most of them I did not know - My sister and brother-in-law were there but they seemed to be people that I didn't know. I remember I was having a good time but I don't remember dancing or talking to anyone-I seemed to be watching the whole affair from a distance. Then I seemed to be back in my house looking for someone in particular. That person was a relative I haven't seen for years. Then I remember she was chasing me in a car--and suddenly I woke up.
