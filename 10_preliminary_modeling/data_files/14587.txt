I was in a car with Dad and we went under this bridge. There was a little plane, a van and two cars in a crash. One was upside down and there was no glass on the road and no people around, but we could hear sirens on the way. Dad said "I bet that [name of guy] guy is like 'what the fuck happened'?". We wondered if the plane crashed and then the others crashed. I was then somewhere else on the computer and I had downloaded about 2gb.
