I am walking in the ocean along the beach about thigh deep. At least I tell myself I am thigh deep, but I don't actually see the water on my legs. I see a wall of water on my left about that height. I am picking up tomato like plants and pulling them out of the ground by their tops which look like carrot tops. I then bury them into the sand again and they transform into eggs which quickly change into hard boiled. Then a sort of human being grows up rapidly out of that. It's kind of fun to watch, but then I get concerned that these new life forms will be abandoned and will die. It's not a good thing to do this for fun and then not be there to help the new creatures.
