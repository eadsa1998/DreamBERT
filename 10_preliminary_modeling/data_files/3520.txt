I am either on a campus, or in an apartment building, in a long hall and Lucy is arrogantly snotty and angry. She yells swear words at the office people. I walk her outside and down a long, rickety ramp. I hear a commotion and look back. The narrator is telling about how it's a very hot day and the animals, especially the big ones, are very irritable. An elephant goes crazy with the heat, which is bad news for the little trainer man. I muse that maybe I should, in my retirement, take on the part-time job of coordinating the disability resources because the different resources offices are in different places and are not run smoothly. I'm mildly interested. Now I hold a big, cream-colored, furry cat and let go of it and expect it to land on its feet and walk away, but the cat is lazy or something and lands painfully on its belly. I drop it again and it does the same thing. I grimace with sympathetic pain and consider the cat rather slow-brained. I go outside and see Howard getting into a box, which is a sort of car. I wait for his wife to get in next. I don't want to get in too early and be alone with him. I put the cat in and wait impatiently for the wife, who comes out arrogant and snotty.
