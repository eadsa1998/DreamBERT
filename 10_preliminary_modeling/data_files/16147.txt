I was at Uncle Carl and Aunt Joyce's house and I was feeding chickens back there, in their back yard, and I was sitting out there looking at the flowers and things. And I was singing this song to the tune of "Blue bird," something like, "Blue bird, chicken corn in your flowers," something really stupid like that. I can't remember, but I think, oh, Dad told me in my dream, "If you were a flower sitting on the fence, and there was this gas in the fence that was affecting you, you would try to burn the fence up." I don't remember exactly how it went, but it was something about covering your tracks. I should have said it when I first woke up, because then it was fresh in my memory.
