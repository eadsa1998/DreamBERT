I was given some vibrators to look after. I put them in the glove box of my car. Later I was with Dad and Ezra. Dad was driving and Ezra was in the back in my seat. I hid another one in the glove box and it wouldn't close. Then I was at home. I went to get them out of the car but they were gone and I remembered that I had text Mom while I was at University to say that I had forgotten my lab coat and to check my bag and other places in my room. Then I was thinking that she didn't find them and they were there. Then I was going out with some guy called Eugene. We and some others went to a house/school place. I had been there when I was younger at least twice before. It was creepy. I remembered that I had found Zelda (Pet Semetary) and it had scared the hell out of me twice. I think that we were in trouble for something. We were in a building and we saw police outside and we all hid under the windows etc. I was in front of a door of a room that Eugene was in. He didn't know what was going on so I made a ssh sign and he went along with it. Then some guy got up and greeted one of the cops and said that we'd been here for a while and that we were okay and the cop left. I told Eugene about Zelda and he got goosebumps. She was actually related to someone and he said that she had freaked him out too. I saw a staircase leading up high and I figured it led up to her. I went to Eugene and grabbed his hand and we went up together. She was sitting at a sewing machine with her back to us. We went up close and then she turned around and it wasn't scary as it had been before. She said "it's coming for you" and I asked what and she talked normally and said "evil". When Eugene left she said it was him. He was like Jekyll &amp; Hyde. I wasn't sure if he knew though.
