 There are two gangs. One gang is very belligerent, irrational, ruthless, and aggressive. I talk to a leader of this bad gang on the phone. I tell him I am Mr. M, trying to sound cool. I work 12:00pm to 12:00 am for the gang. The gang is strict. I agree, but in not in tune with the harsh ways of the gang. Then I am hiding in a residential area, and am part of the good gang. The bad gang is speeding around in their vehicles with guns, trying to scare me, to get me to run, or just to show myself. I lay quietly and they don't see me.
