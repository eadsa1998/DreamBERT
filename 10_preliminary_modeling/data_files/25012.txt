 I'm at home with my girlfriend Annie Thomas. It seems to be my house, but it may also be hers. We're alone. We hear something around the corner. I'm going to punch it, and Annie grabs a hammer. A shirtless man appears. Annie knows him. I don't. He has been living in her room. I take the hammer from her. He is trespassing. I break the television and beat the man with the hammer, putting holes in the walls in the process. The man is dazed. I follow him around and hit him. He retreats. Annie's father and sisters come home. I feel bad when they see the damage to their house.
