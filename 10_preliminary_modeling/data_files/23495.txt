I was in some sort of auditorium or gym in school (high school). We were instructed to walk around the corridor in a line. When we stopped, the teacher separated us into groups of three and we had to go into a tiny room together (me and two other people who were unknown to me). I felt anxious about this and I woke up. I felt ok when I woke up though.
