I dreamed I was in a car with a lot of my friends, boys and girls about my own age. (I didn't recognize any of my friends in real life.) We were driving to a party in a suburb of C--. It was snowing outside. Finally, after we got to the house, I went in and took off my coat. The house was crowded and was thick with smoke. I sat down on a maroon sofa. No one else was sitting on it. Then the hostess walked over and handed me a glass. It looked like ginger ale but I suspected there was liquor in it and did not taste the drink. Someone else came over and introduced Dr. --- to me. (This is a person I had been dating, but hadn't seen in 2 months; was quite depressed.) I looked up. It was the same person, yet he didn't look the same. He wasn't as handsome. He sat down on a chair next to the sofa and was toying with his drink. His sleeves were up a little and I could see he had hairy arms. We conversed. But he had a know-it-all attitude, was curt and abrupt and almost rude. A smile was on his lips all the time. Then everyone seemed to dissolve and there was just the 2 of us. He put down his drink, sat down next to me on the sofa. I knew he was going to kiss me. Then he put his arms around me. I was expectant. When he did kiss me I pushed him away. I didn't like it and I didn't like him any more. I knew then that he had never had any true love for me and had merely been leading me on. I saw him then for what he really was.
