I was coming home from Capitola. We went to the beach called Twin Lakes. My mom and dad took me home. I was then at school. I went to the library because I had forgotten to read a book. When I started to read I got like sucked in. I was doing what the story did. Then it was recess. I did crossing guard, and it was real fun. People wanted to join but we wouldn't let them. Another group that was playing something one of the girls came to us. Her name was Bianca. She asked, "Can I play?" We said no because she never lets us join. Then I took a break and looked around. People were playing a weird kickball game. It wasn't at all like kickball. Then the bell rang. The teacher said to me, "You should finish that book." So I did by going up a chair lift. Then we were at an open house. It had chocolates. There was a red-haired/blonde-haired old man. Setting: At the beach in Santa Cruz, school, and an open house. Characters: The teacher (unknown), mom and dad, friends in game (not very familiar), Bianca (my oldest friend), and a man (unknown). Feelings and Thoughts: Normal. Most of the things I did were normal and I was too.
