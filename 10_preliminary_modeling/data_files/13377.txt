I was reading a book. I read a part in it before but it had a different ending. There was this shelter and the lady was like "just one more person" and this old guy started walking up these steps, slowly. Then this old lady came and walked fast and the lady said that the guy was first and she said "you didn't say till when". She let the old guy in and then he died. I don't remember what happened in the other book. Then I was in some class. Dmitri and others were reading comic books. I was doing something with batteries and magnets. Mr Stevenson dropped some Yu-Gi-Oh! comics on my desk and told me to read them.
