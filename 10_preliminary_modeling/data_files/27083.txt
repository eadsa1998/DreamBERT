I was again living at the nurse's home, but there didn't seem to be any one there that I knew. It seemed as if I was looking for my pearls which I had lost. I had just come off the elevator when I saw part of them on a table in the hallway. It seemed as if there was only the two ends and when I tied them together and put them on they were much to short to wear. I began looking all around again, and then I found the middle part. All the pearls were present and I immediately fastened them together and wore them.
