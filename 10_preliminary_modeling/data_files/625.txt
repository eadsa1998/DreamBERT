I am at the home of a friend, Roseann. She is upset about her husband's death. (He actually is dead.) But in the dream he is in the house. Someone is using dynamite on the house an we have to go to a stairwell in the basement. I ask Brad (her husband) for a shirt because I am naked. I tell him I go like this at home all the time and he says that's okay, it's in the privacy of your own home. There is also something about a little girl in the house with stomach problems and she needs CPR. I run into the same girl later and the principal of our local high school is there and explains there is something wrong with her stomach and this often happens. Later I see her on a corner at a crossroads at a parade and I do CPR. I can see her stomach through her mouth and it has backed up almost to her mouth. I am thinking about calling an ambulance and I wake up.
