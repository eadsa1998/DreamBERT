I remember I was going to go to sleep and it was a warm night. I wanted to use the fan and my mother said not to use it because it was very warm and she said to me that it was true she had the battery charger and could recharge the battery on the fan, but it was a warm night and I should get used to sleeping with out the fan. So I remember being in bed and there were a lot of covers, and it was very hot.
