We went to the shop and I was waiting in the car. Mom went in. I locked the doors. Some guys came and one looked like Mark Wahlberg and one looked like George Clooney. Mark was at the front of the car and put his hands on the front windows on the side of the car and was banging on them. I tried to call Mom but her phone was in the car. They eventually left and Mom came back and I told her to check around the car, but she ignored me and unlocked the car. They started coming back and she got in and we quickly locked the doors.
