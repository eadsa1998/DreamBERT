I was in the lobby of the house for crazies. I went just outside the gate that was open. It was a black metal gate. I slammed it hard and watched it bounce back and forth off the other side. But metal. It more like sorta reverberated less and less until it was still. Smaller. Echoes of the big slam. Then I went and sat in the tall metal chair outside the gate. The metal chair was standing on concrete. I got up after sitting in the chair a while, kicked it over to slam down on the concrete. BAM. CLANK. Mike came out and said, "Stop making that chair so angry." And I said, "Chairs can't be angry. The sound can be angry. I made the sound, but chairs are just there. We try to make them angry or cutesy, but really they are just chairs on concrete. Then I was sitting up in my bed. I could see the people but I didn't know if they could see me.
