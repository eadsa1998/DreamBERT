We are at a distant resort; and we meet up with the SCHRAMMS. They are with friends and so are we. Our plans don't include the others, but I want to spend time with Margaret. Then I get the news that Patrick has died. Should I tell their friends, or wait till they read it in the obituaries? (vague ending)
