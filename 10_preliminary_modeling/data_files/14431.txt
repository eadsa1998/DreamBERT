Dad and I were at the shops, going up an escalator. We went to a small shop. There were DVD's, and as we looked back at them, we both leaned back on the shelf. They had Hancock and another DVD with Will Smith in an action pose, holding a saber. There was a girl in the aisle and we had to squeeze past. I couldn't so I went around the long way, angrily. We went back to the escalators, the same ones we'd gone up, but to leave we had to go up them again. We started walking up the down escalators at first. This black teenage girl was sweeping the floors and singing.
