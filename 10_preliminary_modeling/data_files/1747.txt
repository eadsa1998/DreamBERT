I am on a journey with a group of people. We are walking sort of single file on a woody, narrow trail. I look at one of the people who is standing transfixed, unmoving, at the intense beauty of the mountains, the waters, all that we can see. I am also intensely caught by the beauty of this place. Then we see antelope and polar bear together and sense some danger. They will kill each other for food (at least the bear will.) Our group starts moving back down the trail toward better possible safety. As we are retreating, I hear four beeps go off, the real danger alarm. What timing! I go to find my place to be of help, wondering what the emergency can be. A nun calls my name. I go to her and she tells me of this disabled boy who needs help. I am to help him.
