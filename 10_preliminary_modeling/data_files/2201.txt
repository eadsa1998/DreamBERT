Cary Grant is a spy. He comes to "my house," which is small. The bedroom is in a loft and the two children's beds are in the same room as mine. The bedspreads are all matching. There are a baby girl and a two year old boy. He's a roomer. I go outside and he and I walk down the beach. He says, "We'd better practice cuddling and kissing so we'll look like husband and wife." We do and it's so nice I start to fall in love with him. I hold him to me close and he hugs back. He says with regret, "This usually happens. It will pass." I feel sad. Then I hear music, a woman singing gospel, and we walk over there. Then I look down a hall and see a bad guy and I say, "Quick, look, so you'll know what he looks like too." He looks, red shirt. So I see two doors and I say, "It's a conference of some kind." I go to pretend I'm a member to find out more information. A fat woman, a nurse, comes over to me and I start asking questions. Come to find out, they sell babies form the hospital to childless women, so I pretend I want a baby. She gives me a slip of paper like a Visa slip. It says, "Pick up the baby at the hospital." I ask her name and phone and she gets suspicious.
