I am identified with a young child, whether boy or girl, I am not sure. Much action that I don't recall, as this dream was before the final dream of the night. I am in a cave, exploring, perhaps looking for a way out, as I seem to have been put into this cave by others. I find the ruins of a Buddhist monastery and temple within this cave. Eventually I come into the main room of the temple, where there are tiers of seats facing a goldenish curtain, from under which light comes out. I am somewhat hesitant about looking behind the curtain, but finally do. There is a large statue of the Buddha. It has very amorphous features for a Buddha, is quite old and worn looking -- gives an air of tremendous age. It is slumped in a chair, rather than sitting freely in a lotus posture. As I walk in front of the Buddha, I want to push on the belly, and as I do this, the front of the belly seems to open up (more in my mind than in my perception), and a voice from the statue, invites me to enter into itself and take riches or illumination. I'm not sure of the wording, but I think it was illumination. I enter in .... forgotten action....
