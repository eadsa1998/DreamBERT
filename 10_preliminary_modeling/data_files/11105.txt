I was with my father and we were out looking for a Christmas tree. The funny part about it was that I was dressed in a plaid formal. We rode for a while and finally stopped at one place and got out to get our tree. The girl in charge told me to pick out a tree. I told her I couldn't and she said, "You mean to tell me you can't tell good wood from bad wood?" This made me feel useless and definitely inferior to everyone else.
