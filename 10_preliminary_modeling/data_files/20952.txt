We walked down past the school house in Rivertown to an old frog pond. There was water in it and ice was on the sides of the pond. The water moved back and forth as though there was a force moving it. It came to the center, then moved out to the sides as the water does on a big lake from large waves. Bob picked up a stick and was going to play with it in the water, but I said, "No, you can't. The water is filthy." Some water came out of a pipe and I touched it with my fingers, and it was dirty. There were two fellows with us. One had on a tan, another a white, and I a green shirt. One fellow laid in the pond and another one monkeyed around, leaning back to the pond and holding on to me. He went all the way down and I held on to him and picked him upright. I saw clear water coming into the pond. I followed the stream by eye and a water hydrant was open by some kid so the pond wouldn't go dry.
