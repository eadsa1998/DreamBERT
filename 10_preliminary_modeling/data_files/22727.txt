Then I had another dream. I was at home, but it was the house I lived in when I was very little. A friend of mine was there and he told me to go look for something, but I don't know exactly what it was. I went to look for that thing. I went to look for it in my house; I looked in every room. But something scared me and I returned quite frightened.
