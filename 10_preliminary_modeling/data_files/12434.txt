I was in this cage thing. I forget what happened before, but anyway, Daryl and I were going out or something and we were both in this cage thing. Darth Vader sent us out and was fighting us. Darth was on the roof. He showed us a big building thing. I couldn't fight back, so he was teaching me how to use the force. At home, out the back, Anakin was chucking a spaz about Darth Vader [this doesn't make sense, but there you go]. He had a rocket.
