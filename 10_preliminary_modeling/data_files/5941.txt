Am in a country I think is Greece or Cyprus and am dressed in business suit, but with British Army officers' hat on my head. Am looking for a barrack and keep trying to remember where it is since I am sure I was there once before. Some places look familiar; others don't, and I find myself on a street completely unfamiliar. Go in a police station and there a boy with a map directs me. I leave, but still am not sure I am going in the right direction.
