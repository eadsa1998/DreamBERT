I am in a cafeteria of a school. You have to purchase the meal all together. I say, "But I don't want all of it. I only want two pieces of bacon." The man at the cash register is annoyed with me. I say, "I think you should only pay for the part you eat." He is adamant. I refuse to comply. My way makes more sense. I decide to leave and go to the movies. I am talking to Merle. He has seen the movie. He liked it. A man who might be gay says I will love the hero. He is very feminine (like he is saying "a hunk" or beautiful).
