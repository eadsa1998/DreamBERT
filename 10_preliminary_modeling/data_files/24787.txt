It is very, very hard to describe what happened. Well, in this dream, which is a nightmare, there is a big smooth piece of white satin and a corner in an alleyway filled with trash. I run back and forth to the satin then the trash, back and forth and back and forth. But in the middle of the piece of satin is a woman. It winds up being my mom and her bed because I jump out of bed and run back and forth (in real life, but I'm mostly asleep). Setting: In an alleyway and a big piece of satin with a woman on it. Characters: A woman, who turns out to be my mom when I wake up, who sits in the satin saying, "It's okay, it's okay." Feelings and Thoughts: Scared. Once it's over it's pretty scary, but you laugh about it later.
