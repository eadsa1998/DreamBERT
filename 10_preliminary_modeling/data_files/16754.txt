I'm at a DSA event. I think it was supposed to start at 5:00 but it's dark and I wonder if I'll even be awake by the time the thing is over. I remember flags, a state flag, for example, and I think it was something of a military game. I go over to what I think now is a water well. What happens there, I don't remember, but I like it. Then, I'm walking around a house or building and become lucid. I try to think logically and quiz myself, which increases my awareness and consciousness. Then, I tell myself to do an addition problem like 17 + 28 and I feel fully capable of doing the problem although I don't want to take the time to figure it out. I see writing on the walls, which doesn't make much sense. The individual words make sense but I can't make out the sentences. Then, I remember a sign that said "Metal Still" or something of the sort, and I wanted myself to remember it when I woke up. I see the well I was at earlier near the back of the house. I think this is the house where the three girls from the previous dream are living. I look for an entrance but I can't find it.
