I had a dream my boyfriend had a skylight above his bed. (Those big windows in the ceiling.) Anyways, one morning we woke up and I noticed a building where you could see up into other people's apartments. Which of course meant they could see into ours. I noticed this guy standing up against his window with his face pressed against it looking down at us. At first I thought he was a pervert but then I saw someone come up behind him and put a gun to his head. Then he shot him. The guy that shot him noticed us staring back at him. When he realized that we saw the whole thing he pointed the gun down at us as if he were going to shoot through that window, then our window, to kill us. We both rolled off the bed and tried to get things together to leave. He and his partners found us and shot us in the back of the head. I remember feeling the blood drip down my back and falling to the floor. Everything got cloudy and I tried to talk to my boyfriend but the words wouldn't come out right. I didn't feel any pain -- just felt like I was getting sleepy. Then the ambulance came and I woke up.
