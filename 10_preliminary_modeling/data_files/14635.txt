I was at university. It was Tuesday and I had chemistry but I forgot my lab coat. I was annoyed about it. I needed to get changed and wandered into a building, which was like a house. There was a young girl in there and she had a Furby and I was like 'I remember when they first came out'. We chatted for a bit and then I left. I went into my class, but it was full of random students. Then I needed to go to the toilet and someone showed me where one was. There was a huge queue, which had girls and boys, but then there was a fork where it separated into separate toilets. I finally got in and it was a huge room with toilets everywhere and no cubicles. There was a cubicle one but it had a weird spray of water about head level. Some boys came in and attacked this girl. They threatened me and I was like 'what the hell, I don't even know who you are'. They tried to attack me and I tried to punch but it was slow and difficult.
