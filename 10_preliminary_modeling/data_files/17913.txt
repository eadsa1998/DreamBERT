I was walking to my parents' house, down the cross street I suppose.  I passed the irrigation ditch and there was a kid on a bike.  A car nearly hit us and swerved, tapping into two cars in front of us.  The front car lost control and started heading for our house.  It looked like it touched but the car kept going.  I went to the house and I wanted to look at the damage, but got distracted and went inside.  I was holding two red birds- some type of small parrot perhaps.  One started pecking at its feet, and the foot popped right off.  I was disgusted and saddened by this, and looked away.  I had been eating something, but couldn't continue.  My mouth got stuck in an open position.  It was as if the bird's foot was like a loose tooth and my jaw locked out of fear so I couldn't feel the empty socket/loose tooth in my mouth.  My mother tried to help push my jaw closed.  Then we watched TV.  I was amazed and did a double take when I saw the car crash I'd witnessed outside the house on the news.  I vividly remember the colors in the identification.  On the news, though, they said a window to the house was broken when the car hit.  I realized I'd forgotten to check and ran to see if it was true- it was.  The window was cracked with a center impact point.
