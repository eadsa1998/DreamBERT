I recall that I woke up late for school one morning and that I skipped showering and eating breakfast so I could catch the train. I then got a phone call from a friend who told me that a friend of ours had been in a motorcycle accident and he was paralyzed. He said that we should go give him our support. I showed up there and he was wheeling himself around in a wheelchair. I had to calm him down because he didn't want to live anymore due to his condition. Nobody else was there and I didn't know what to do.
