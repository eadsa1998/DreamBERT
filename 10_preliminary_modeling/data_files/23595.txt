My sister Ann and I are driving home from a family function that went on until really late. I'm in a rush to get home because I'm tired, cold, and nauseated. It's foggy and there are two large black men in the middle of the street. We both start to scream "Oh my God! They have guns!" Ann tries to swerve the car out of their way, but one of the thugs starts shooting and gives us a flat tire. They come over to the car and demand for us to get out. I'm going to be raped, is what I'm thinking. The men push Ann and me onto the sidewalk, face first. "Now," the tallest one says, "I'Ã•m gonna show you a picture and I want you to tell the truth if you seen this guy before." This monster's gun is pointed at the back of my head. I can't see Ann. The darkest skinned bald-headed guy shoves the picture in my face and says, "I'm not gon' tell you again." I have no idea who the guy in the picture is. "Bitch, you bet not be lying to me, cause I'm human, I ain't gon' blast you if you cooperate." I hear him walk over to Ann. "You know dude?" "No, I don't," I hear my older sister say, in the scaredest voice I've ever heard. "I ain't gon' kill her" (he must have pointed towards me) "but I am gonna kill you." I hear a gun go off, then running. I turn to look at my sister and there is blood coming from her head like a river. I'm slipping and sliding in my sister's blood trying to get her to wake up, because I know she can't be dead. She is dead. No one is on the street except us. I wake up crying.
