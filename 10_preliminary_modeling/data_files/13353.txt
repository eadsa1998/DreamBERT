There was some underground 'spy' place. Stan Lee was there. Later, this lawyer came and this guy was talking to him and said "I don't trust lawyers, too much [something I don't remember]. What do you do?" and the guy replied "I'm a lawyer". There were people in some place who they were going to kill. David Anders was there and he went down a 'hole'. The holes were how you got down there. The good guys escaped. Someone was yelling at me because I left a 'hole' open and the people found it.
