I was riding on my bicycle and thought I'd go downtown but didn't know where it was legal to ride, so I decided I'd better park the bicycle and go on the bus. Saw the policeman's family in the yard which looked like Queen's Hospital grounds and thought of asking him but then I couldn't find the bicycle. At last spied it on its side with the youngest boy sitting on it. I felt angry and shook him and gave him two light spanks and scolded him, and told him people would like him better if he didn't get into so much mischief. Then she asked me if I was going to some fete. I said I was planning to. She said, "Let's go together." I said, "I must change my dress" and went upstairs to do so. Came down in Mabel's outfit but no hat. Her friend asked if I was not wearing a hat and then said, "I guess I'll take off my hat.' But she went by herself. Then the Z's wife came and the younger boy was going too. She had some part in the fete. I asked where it was. She said it was on Kapiolani Blvd. She had a big load. I carried some of it. I thought, "That isn't where I was going." It must be a Catholic benefit." It was 6 p.m. and I wondered if I could get back in time for dinner. Almost backed out but decided there'd be refreshments so went on. The bus came and she got on but the boy and I didn't in time. She got off at the next stop and came back up many steps rather put out, complaining of her climb. I told her it was the awkward bundle which I was trying to fix as to carry it better that had made me miss the bus and asked how often the busses ran. "Every 5 minutes each way." Then another bus came and we got on it  but it went up like an elevator. The boy didn't make it. I said, "I wish I had a free hand to hold him." She said, "Don't worry about him. He'll be all right." I wondered how he would get home because we had walked quire a way. Then I saw a small procession in holokus and knew we were about there and the program hadn't begun, guess they were just lining up.
