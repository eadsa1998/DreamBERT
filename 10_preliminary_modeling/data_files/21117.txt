Ann and I went to teacher's meeting. There was a colored boy. Ann's skirt was up when she was fixing her stocking and this colored boy always leaned forward close and looked at Ann's legs. I got mad and I hit him in the face. He got a black eye from that. Ann and I were greasing the, or oiling the bridge and I said, "That black bastard, how he was looking at your legs." And then I noticed a couple of colored men and they heard me. I knew they would come after me, so Ann and I went away. I opened up a can; there was oil in it. It was thick so I mixed or stirred it. The Laskos were looking for us. They walked by our fence and asked if Cutlers lived here, and I said no, but Evans lived here and they didn't know who we were. Cutler was dead lying there in the house. I picked up a large grape off a grape vine and ate it. Was it sweet. I was chasing a young girl. She was bashful and shy. I was riding a bicycle with Barbara thru Fairchance. There were ripe bananas hanging on trees. I did a stunt whirling in the air. There was a big, dead tree.
