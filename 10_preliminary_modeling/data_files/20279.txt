I was trying to repair a platform, but it kept falling again. My mother was there. A pot fell, and I caught it, but it crumbled in my hands. Later I passed a bathroom where a woman was bathing a child about 12. Then I passed a bathroom with a drinking fountain next to a vanity type sink. I wondered what was in there.
