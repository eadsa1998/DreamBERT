I was pregnant and close to giving birth. I was at a hospital and I was thinking back to the beginning where they took "15mL" of the father's blood (don't remember who it was) to give to the baby. Then it was Peyton (One Tree Hill) and I wondered if she was pregnant because the actress was pregnant in real life.
