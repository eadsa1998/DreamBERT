This is St. Patrick's Day. I had a brief dream last night. Lately I've been doing the same where my body's gearing up for the time change and so I've been waking up at 6:00, going pee, getting a drink of water and then usually I lay back down because I'm just barely navigating and I don't really want to get up when it's still dark. And so in that morning between 6:00 and 7:00 I had a brief dream that Duane and Janelle were out of town, but where they were was at this Festival of Dolls, I think Mom was calling it. And I sort of had a vision as if I was there with them. And in my dream Duane and Janelle plus Cassandra and Courtney and Corinne and Eddie were all like one big happy family, which to me, in my eyes, they are. And it would be really nice if we would all know each other and be friends. But anyway, I had a vision like I was there at this thing of theirs and everywhere I went I was hearing bells going, "Ding dong dong ding, ding dong dong ding, ding dong dong ding," kind of like that song we do and kind of like how it is. Oh gosh, I can't think how it goes, I think it's C, E, D, G, C, E, D, G -- you know how bells are. And so I was hearing bells and I was in this back yard that was bigger than ours, but looked about the same as ours. And it was dark out and there was a big swing, and I was swinging on the swing and having a lot of fun. And I was making the swing spin around and twist all around and swing, and just have fun. And Eddie was on another swing, and Mom said, "Be careful, you're not wearing a bra. You don't want Eddie to see your boobs, do ya?" And at this party I was like totally naked. [laugh] And I was swinging on the swing and having a lot of fun, and my boobs were bouncing all over, of course. And then I woke up. I can't remember anything more. [laugh] I know I had some other dreams, but they were kind of boring and I didn't remember them after that morning hour.
