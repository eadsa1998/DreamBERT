I had this really stupid dream that I had to take an SCAT test. I'm a senior now, so I don't have to take it, but there's been a lot of hullabaloo around school caused by it. So then that I had to take the SCAT test, I could take it home and take as long as I wanted, and I had the notion, and I had this notion that I could go to this website and get all the answers and cheat on it. I was going to do this in my studio and go online with the MAC and so this while I was listening to some kind of CD and just take forever and do this test and get it all right. And I can't remember, I think I kept wanting to sit down and get this started, and there was just so much other stuff I kept getting interrupted. And that's it.
