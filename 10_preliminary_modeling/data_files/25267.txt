 I go into the Middle Mall the same night that I closed the mall early. There are few people inside. Another employee, Bill, is in the office, which is in the mall now, instead of being a back room. I talk to him. He says I'm in luck: our boss Andy isn't here. I tell him why I have closed the mall early. He says they still like to have someone at the mall until 10:00 pm. Another employee, Dale, has some photographs of different sizes. They have a pornographic feeling to them. Some of the photographs are of good-looking men; others are of giant cartoon characters.
