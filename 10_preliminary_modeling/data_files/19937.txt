I was working at a printing plant. I was in some kind of trouble -- not serious. But I was also in trouble about bothering a child. I had to stay away from the job that day. I was walking in a place that looked like a stadium. A man who looked like the charge officer on my former ward (Mr. Thoms) came over to me and said he would help me. He said, "You know that it is a serious thing to molest a child, don't you?" I said, "Yes, I do."
