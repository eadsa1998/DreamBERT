It was this week but it was the last week of school. I was annoyed because they had said last week was the last week. We didn't do any work and just mucked around and it was really boring. On Wednesday Dad went to get breakfast from the shop. Mom picked me and Ezra up and we went back to her house. I decided I was going to go back to bed and go into school at 4pm for graduation practice. There were three water bottles on the kitchen sink.
