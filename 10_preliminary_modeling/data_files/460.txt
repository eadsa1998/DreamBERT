I was doing an experiment and I was trying to describe what I was doing on a paper. Then I was in a computer room with my sister and mother taking a class. The dream bounced around a lot. I was outside talking to friends; they were people I didn't know, but I had a sense they were my friends. I had lost my keys and was talking on the phone for a long time to one of my partners in my perception lab group. Then I went into a store with an old high school friend looking at sorority paraphernalia. I didn't see anything I liked, so I went to another store I knew of that carried sorority merchandise. When I walked in, I saw a lot of formal dresses and the store seemed empty; no one was in sight. Then all of a sudden I see the owner of the store run from a bathroom across the hall to another room naked. I looked away a little shocked. She poked her head around the door and said, "I'll be right with you." I went into another room to look through the shirts and T-shirts. I was folding up a sweatshirt and putting it back when the lady scolded me for folding the shirt the wrong way. So I felt the need to hurry and get what I wanted from the store to get out of there. Then I saw my best friend from high school buying something, which relaxed me.
