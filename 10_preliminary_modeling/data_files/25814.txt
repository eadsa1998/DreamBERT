 There is a house with two couples and others in it. I may be there, or I may be viewing this. There is a loft-type area in the house, with a whirlpool near it. The couples are trying to decide who gets to stay in the loft for the first night. There is styrofoam insulation around the steps in the house. This is what keeps the house warm, and keeps the heat circulating.
