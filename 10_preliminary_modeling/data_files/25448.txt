 I'm hunting ducks with my friends Stephen Ramos and Kevin Simpson at the Holiday Inn in Oak Valley. We don't shoot any ducks. It is getting too dark to shoot or to see. My friend Terry Foss is there. There area is a sandy beach. There are some photographs there. It is hard to tell what is happening in each one. I decide that if I have a gun in the photographs that I am hunting, and if I don't I am at the beach. I have a shotgun with a scope on it. Stephen finds a cat. He snuggles up to it, and tells me he wants to shoot it. It is blue and white in color, with patchy black on its face. Its teeth are old and worn: broken. In an appalled manner I tell Stephen I'm not going to shoot it.
