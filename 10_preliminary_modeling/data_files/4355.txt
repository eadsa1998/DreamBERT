["Am I being prudish?"] Ginny and Ernie are there. I am seated on a couch. Ginny starts to talk to me. I see Charla to the right. She is completely naked. I am shocked. Ginny is trying to tell me that I am being prudish about this. I say but this isn't right. Charla has sexual abuse issues and you are persuading her to feel comfortable about being sexually vulnerable in public. Ernie comes and sits on the couch by me. He and Ginny are trying to convince me it is my prudish attitude that is at fault here. I am shocked at them for encouraging Charla in this way. I am nose to nose with Ernie. He has a round metal tab on the end of his nose like the Tinman in the Wizard of Oz. He doesn't approve of my attitude. I try and explain that this is exactly what I am trying to minimize in Charla's life, the tendency to dress sexy and attract sexual attention. This is a harmful behavior for Charla, I say. They are obviously in disagreement with me.
