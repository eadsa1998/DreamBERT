I was playing a game (that was kind of playing out in real life), with zombies and I had a camera which could change their temperament. There were three settings; calm, 'normal' and threat. When they were calm they just completely ignored you, when they were normal they would be zombie-like, but not fast and aggressive but when they were at threat level they would come running at you trying to get you no matter what. When you put them in calm mode, it would only last a certain amount of time before changing. The setting was similar to Dying Light, although the first location was like a shopping centre. It was like a tutorial stage and I had a zombie running towards me and I flashed the camera and turned him calm and then walked through. I made it out and then it was quiet outside. I walked down some steps and then decided I didn't feel like playing anymore but I didn't know how to save the game.
