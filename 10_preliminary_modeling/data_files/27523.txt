I had just washed my hair and set it. In a few minutes, it was dry and was combing it out. It was turning a bright shade of red as I combed it. I always set a deep wave in the front. This time, I did the same, but when I combed it out, the wave wasn't there. I was very sad about this. I tried to comb the wave back in, but the more I combed, the straighter my hair became on top. I was very disgusted and worried.
