I heard a burglar downstairs and I went downstairs after him. I jumped him and we started to fight. He had a knife in his hand and he slashed my shoulder. He got up and ran away with me getting up and chasing him. I kept running and running while I was getting weaker. I finally caught him and we started fighting again. He got me down and pulled his knife on me. Just as he was ready to stab me I woke up.
