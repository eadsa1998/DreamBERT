I was at work in my lab. I had connected all the electrodes to a patient for a brain wave test and got him set for the test. I turned the dial to start the test when I heard a strangled cry from the patient. I looked at him and saw, to my horror, that there were little blue and yellow streaks (like lightning) coming out of the scalp at the place where each electrode was attached. The patient writhed around and his face began to turn red. I became very excited and did not know what to do. I remember that the tears were running down my face and I was crying aloud as I started turning dials and pushing buttons in an effort to cut off the current.
