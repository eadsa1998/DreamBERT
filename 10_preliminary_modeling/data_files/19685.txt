I went into a men's clothing store, apparently to buy a top coat or over coat. Practically all the clothes hangers were empty, the store evidently having sold all but 3 or 4 coats. A clerk first showed me a light gray with some sort of extremely conspicuous designs on the sleeves. I immediately said it wouldn't do, and the clerk half nodded or half smiled -- I took it that he agreed (though for business reasons he of course wouldn't say so) that this particular model was terrible. Then I was much surprised to be shown an attractive dark gray top coat with a hat to match -- surprised because, usually, when a supply of clothing is nearly exhausted as was the case in this store, the "left overs" are all ugly.
