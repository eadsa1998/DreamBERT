[1997-05-28] I was up in a weather tower somewhere and I was being shown around this place by someone and there were a lot of other people around there too. I don't know why I was there or anything, but that was the dream, seemed like a rather strange one. I don't even know where this weather tower was located. I t may have been Stockard Airport or somewhere else.
