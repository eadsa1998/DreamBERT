I was working Dill's. I received a letter from White's to come back to work. I went to see Benny Meader. I had some paper in one hand and a pencil in the other hand. I told Benny that I would have to reject his offer. He was surprised because he was almost sure that I was going to take it. Andy Palader and he was courteous to them. The young lady was going to college. I was concerned about the job at White's.
