My dreams were now on DreamBank, but the site was different and it had more detail and articles etc. They had put "new batteries" in my calculator. I told Mom about it later. Ezra had mentioned being on it but I didn't realize until later that it meant he knew who I liked. I was then at home so I could watch a movie that was in the Top 250. It was oldish and boring and after six minutes I called Mom to get me. She said she'd be there soon and would get me when she came to get Ezra (which was going to be on Thursday). I yelled at her, complaining but then I realized it was Thursday. The movie had now been going for 46 minutes. I heard a high pitch squealing noise and thought 'bomb' and looked outside. There was a light in the sky and it came rushing towards us, it was an 'aftershock'. Ezra didn't notice and I told Mom later. Darren had a 3-way phone? We were in the car and in the back. I was in the middle and Ezra was in his normal spot. We were going to see some friend.
