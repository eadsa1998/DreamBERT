I was seated in an old-fashioned classroom near the center front of the class. Standing to my right in the front of the class were two girls, one dressed in a red dress with white dots and white fancy lace neckpiece, the other in a green dress with white dots and fancy collar. As I sat there I was very perturbed to see that the two girls had malformed short arms -- about one-half the length of normal arms. The teacher was reprimanding me for noticing the girls' deformities and noting that they were abnormal. I awoke feeling hurt and with my ego rather shaken.
