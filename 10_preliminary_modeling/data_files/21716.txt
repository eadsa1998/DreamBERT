I was driving my car backwards at night because I could not see where I was going. Bob had two baseball bats. I picked them up and swung them both at once and said, "It would be easier to hit the ball with both bats." Mr. Cooker said Dave had about 8 friends and that was too many. Mrs. Cooker was in the backyard and her hair was all messed up. She looked a sight. I saw one horse which won and paid $22. I was supposed to have him. I said, "That will give me $11."
