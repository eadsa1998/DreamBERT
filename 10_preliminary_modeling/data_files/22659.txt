I was in a flower shop; there were many vases with flowers. Next to me was a nice little old man who showed me the flowers and told me where they came from. He showed me roses, carnations, lilies, and orchids, but none made an impression on me. Then I saw pots with tall plants which I had never seen. The leaves were thorny and smooth at the same time. Then the old man came out of there with me and he kept explaining: he told me that he was a botanist, that he collected flowers. We passed by places which looked like plantations. Afterwards he went into a white house which seemed to be made of marble.
