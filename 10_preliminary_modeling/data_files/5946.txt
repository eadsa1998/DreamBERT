Am standing across the street from the RR station in a group of people I apparently know. We are all observing the passersby on their way to the station, from where they catch the train for the beach. Every few minutes I see someone I know in the crowd going to the station. Finally I count out " ... 10, 11, 12 .... that makes 12 guys I know from our crowd. Guess it's time for me to go to the beach." But I head away from the station and say to someone that I have to change my good trousers to khaki ones before I can go. Strolling up the street, I feel unusually good and strong and healthy and I stretch my arms out to the side and then overhead and exercise as I walk along, now and then swinging my arms. Then I see a girl in a store window rearranging some dummies and I feel sorry that she must work while everyone goes to the beach.
