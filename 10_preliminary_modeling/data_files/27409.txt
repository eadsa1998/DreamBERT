This was a very short dream in which I was looking over the edge of a cliff (I don't know where it could be; it was totally unfamiliar to me) and suddenly the wind came along and almost blew me over the edge. I had to keep fighting to keep from going over the edge. That's all I remember; I don't know whether I went over the edge or not.
