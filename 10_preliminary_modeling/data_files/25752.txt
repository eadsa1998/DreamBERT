 There is an Armstrong High School basketball party at my house. There is pizza there. My aunt Rachel Redding is the reporter there. We have an important game coming up, and are having a meal before it so we can spend time with each other. A newspaper article is being written about us. I toss a Polaroid photograph like a Frisbee. Rachel interviews me second. I say, "It (the game) is about whoever has the stronger mind." There is a photograph or video taken. I joke about getting a front-page article written about me, saying that I am strong. The reporter says I am skinny. There is a phone call, an interruption. Music is playing loudly. The police come. I say we're not changing anything because we're not doing anything wrong. The fat old police office can't do anything, and he leaves. There is snow on the ground. People are throwing snowballs. The bass from the radio is playing in the neighbor's driveway. Our music is loud.
