The cats were with me in the house at school.  I had no litter for them, but I found a small bit and planned to put the box in the closet.  In my hometown, we staged something for my cousin Allen.  We blew up (or rather had) the front part of our house.  We were trying to get out in a hurry before the explosion.  Then, again.  We were trying to escape in a hurry but our neighbor pulled up in the driveway, blocking us.  I was yelling about my paternal step-Grandpa Sal still being in the bathroom- and what about the cats?!  I got nervous when a cop pulled up, afraid we'd get in trouble for the destruction, but he helped us clear out.  As we drove off the bomber looked out the window.  My Tuvan instructor Jim Hale was with him.
