I had a new timetable for university. I had nothing on Tuesday and Monday, but I had classes on the weekend. Lots of them went until late. I complained about it. We went to Nana's and they had gotten rid of the middle fish pond and had had just kept the pond there (all the plants and the gazebo area were gone). She said they were getting rid of the other one, but were waiting to see if frogs were in there. She was grabbing fish with the net. I showed Dad my timetable. We went to this shop. There was a retard guy and he kept making this weird 'blklbll' sound and Dad and I were trying not to laugh. He kept following us, which was creepy. Then I took a train to the train station, but I missed the bus because the one I had been on had missed my stop, but Mom came straight there.
