The world, or at least the USA, was taken over by these lizard-like and undead mutants whose goal seemed to be to enslave and exterminate humans. There seemed to be some motive for not doing it one at a time. My character became part of the resistance and was always trying to escape from these characters -- always male. One involved fight was a snake-like creature who I escaped from on a rocket pack. I was only saved when the "resistance" drove up in big colored trucks and shot at them and then I flew over him and delivered final blow. In another sequence, I skated down an ice-covered hill fast enough to escape the skeletons. At one point, I had sex with one of the heads of the resistance -- it was really important that I was ovulating. I guess because reproduction was discouraged by the creatures. The ending was hazy -- after some time where I seemed to know I was pregnant. I walked into a restaurant where I saw John and Ann and told them I was pregnant. John said congratulations, the menu had instructions inside on the uses of IUDs. I remember telling John I helped Ann learn to masturbate with a vibrator and had a flashback of it.
