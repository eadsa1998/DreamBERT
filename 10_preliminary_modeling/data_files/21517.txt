I was in an eating establishment. After I was through, I went to the rear room where there was whiskey. I had to squeeze thru a tight passage and when I got to the room, I saw an old lady there. I said I wanted a big shot. She looked in a book. It was like a map and she ran a paper on this map. She said, "This is sunshine." Then she came to a star and I said, "Five star Hennessy." I said, "How much is it?" and she said, "Let's look at the map again." So she got the paper and slid it by the bright shining. She said sun, then lower and I said, "There is the star." It was bright and larger than the stars around it. I saw sheep running away. Then she took the paper away and I could see the star shining. I saw a 1 mark move and stop over number 89. I have a thought I heard Come in my sleep.
