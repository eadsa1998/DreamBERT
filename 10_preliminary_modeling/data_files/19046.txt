My first thought on being awakened was that it was pointless to wake me up because it was raining. This somehow meant that there was no possibility of having a dream and at the time seemed quite plausible to me. Next I'm on a basketball court. It seems that I'm a coach and I'm discussing various aspects of basketball and basketball practice with this other coach. We're discussing half court games vs. full court games, and we're also discussing relative effects of real games vs. practice games from the point of view of fatigue. He gets more tired during the practice and I get more tired during the real games. Then I'm playing basketball, and I'm much younger. This is an interesting contrast here. One thing in the dream, I'm a much better player than I ever was in reality. That's one difference. Then there's within the dream, for example, up to now I haven't been terribly sure of myself. It's like this other coach, maybe he knows his business a lot better than I do, and I'm just putting on a front. But in the game now wher I'm back younger, I'm also feeling very confident. One play is particularly vivid. This player on my team comes dribbling down the court and he's completely bottled up. I know he's looking around for me so he can pass me the ball, but he can't see me. I can see that I could come up from behind and just take the ball out of his hands and score an easy basket. So I shout to him that's, well, I just to him my name I think and try to take the ball and go in for a lay-up, but he doesn't let me have it as I go by. I think at that moment, "Gee, that's a nifty play." He didn't know it was me, but we'll have to work on that one, and in two or three times that will be a real score maker. Then I can see another play. I remember somebody on my team is on the other end of the court and he is tied up. I start up and I'm way down at the opposite end, clear, and he's about to throw a full court pass.
