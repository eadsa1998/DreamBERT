I was at school, perhaps in physics.  I think my friend Leon was there.  The sub led us down to a housing track in construction, and through the gates.  Memory is sketchy and I can't remember the important parts.  It seemed like it was the teacher's fault.  My right leg or arm was injured.  There was a 2-inch vertical cut on the left corner of my mouth.  On the right side of my chin was a 1 cm diameter hole, bleeding.  The hole was too big to spurt blood, but too small to gush.  Blood was pouring out.  I had a bruised cheek.  I had to hold the wound on my chin so I could not talk well.  Something about these violent dreams enchants me.  I vaguely remember Leon and I riding in a cart or forklift.
