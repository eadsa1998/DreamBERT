My son and I and some people we know were on a barge in the ocean. It was open and uncovered. The "drivers" kept making it go really fast and I knew if anything came in our way we would crash and die. My son was missing. Someone said he flew out of the boat. There were acting like it was no big deal. I was panicked, horrified, but then I saw him. Everyone, including my son, insisted that it was not him. My son ran away. I couldn't catch him. I was crying and screaming.
