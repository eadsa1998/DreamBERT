I was on the farm and a civil war or feud was taking place. A man named O'Neill, tall and thin with black hair, said he had a treasure at bottom of muddy swampy lake in our horse and mule place below our barn. "I'll kill anyone who comes close." He dives in and comes up; assumption is that it's there, perhaps in a chest. I go around to come in at back, some bullets still flying around me. I get to back side of large pen behind the barn and climb a hill-cliff to be above him. At top I'm not at our farm; I'm in suburbia like house, oak trees and edges of lawns. I throw rocks at sea creatures or rocks of same shape, like stinging rays and squid; one shaped like this seems to move from my rock or alive... Dogs come out and I throw at them; my brother comes out and I almost hit him. Dream stops.
