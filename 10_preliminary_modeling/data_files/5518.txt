Today is what we call Patriots Day in Maine. I dreamed about my second husband, whose memory I detest and despise. The dream is not clear, even when I first woke up, apparently I was either visiting or living with some women, all women, in the dream I knew who they were but now I don't. I had been somewhere and I came back with 2 or 3 suitcases and we were sitting around a table talking and I was telling them about my trip and suddenly it hit me that I had been back for a day or more and I hadn't called my husband, apparently in this dream we were still married. Someone else called him and in the next sequence was him sitting at a table with a can of beer in front of him and he had been drinking, very obviously from the look on his face, I remember that look very clearly and he was very sweet in the dream, very nice and he understood why I hadn't called him because I was excited about the trip and coming back , and then we were in a bedroom, I think, preparing to go to bed and there were sliding glass doors and they were covered with draperies and I opened the draperies and that's the end of that dream.
