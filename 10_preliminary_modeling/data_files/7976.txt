The characters on the show Seventh Heaven. Mary had been killed by a burglar. She joined a child that they had lost. The child was about a year younger or a year older than Mary. I can't remember her name now. Mary was visiting the different family members that she left. her husband and her children. She was visiting them frequently to watch over them and see what was going on with them.
