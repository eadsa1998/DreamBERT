There's some kind of game which requires skill. It's like a magical version of scooter riding - like riding a carpet or a broomstick. I'm good at it. My cousin Claire is learning how to do it, and I'm showing her. This dream may be rooted in an incident that occurred when I was a child. It was when I had just recently learnt to ride a bicycle on the road outside my house. Claire was struggling to learn and was being coached by my aunt Cici. Cici was annoyed with me for shouting "Look at me, I can do it!" while she was still trying to coach Claire.
