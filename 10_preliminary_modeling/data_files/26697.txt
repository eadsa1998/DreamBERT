 I'm going to a football game with my family. My mom and my three siblings are there, I think. I talk about Australia with my brother Wally and sister Heather: we disagree about the location of Brisbane and the Tasman Peninsula. We go to the football stadium and I quickly get in line to get tickets for all of us, ahead of the others. When I get up to buy them I ask the man about prices. It costs too much, I don't want to pay. The ticket salesman has contempt for me, and withdraws the tickets from the counter. Then, a scalper comes up and slaps his tickets down, giving them to me! The game has started, and the scalper can't get a good price for them, so he's giving them to me. We all walk to the stands. We have good seats. The game is outside. I soon see it is Australian Rules Football.
