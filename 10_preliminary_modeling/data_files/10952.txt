I dreamt I was going along with a group of friends on a trip. The others were coming for me at a certain time and I had very little time to get ready. One of the girls that was going, my cousin who is 17, usually is dressed very neatly and looks very attractive, came before I was ready. This time she amazed me because she looked very sloppy and messy and I couldn't believe she would ever look like that. When the rest of the gang came, I still was looking for the dress I wished to wear, everyone was rushing around packing lunches, etc., and our house was in a turmoil.
