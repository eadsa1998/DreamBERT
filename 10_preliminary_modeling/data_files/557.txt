I am driving back from a town near my hometown thinking I need to slow down so as to not hit someone. I slow and two boys, one big and one small, appear in the road. I barely miss them and keep going. I am next at work and the local funeral directors bring in a body in parts. I think it is Oprah Winfry but it looks like a white mannequin. Someone says they wouldn't fix it because it was a "skull hanging". A man I work with has to fix it and it smells bad. I may have to do the makeup. I know I am sleeping but I can't wake up. I think my son is in the house and he comes to the bedroom and I manage to say help me wake up and he does, but he isn't really there. That was a dream too.
