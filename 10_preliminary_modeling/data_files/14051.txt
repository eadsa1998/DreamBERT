I was watching a movie with Linda Cardellini in it. She was the main character but she was different. Her brother, his friend (who looked like Bradley) and this other guy went on a holiday. A crocodile tooth got in her and she died, but they took her somewhere and this guy ate something with the crocodile and she was then alive, but different. When she took this stuff, her eyes went black and she went a little crazy. She made her brother and Bradley makeout and hug and then gave Bradley boobs and 'femininity'. This guy called Brian realized and said she was doing it because she liked him. He was in this room and she made the window disappear. I grabbed his hand thinking if I was touching him she wouldn't be able to erase him, but we got confused and I let go and he faded away. She killed some people and then brought him back. Her eyes went normal and she smiled. I looked the actor up and his name was James Me, but his website was "nathanscott.com". I was then watching an episode of One Tree Hill. Ezra came in and I paused it on James Lafferty. He wanted to check the show out and I said "no, how about you get out of my room?"
