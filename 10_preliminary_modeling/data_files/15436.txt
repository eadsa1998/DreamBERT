I was at Nana's. There was a party? There was food and stuff outside but we had to cook as we ordered (it was set up like Chicken Treat). They had a 'run' which had different sections, all enclosed, with lots of grass and bushes that had a yellowish colour. I went to the end and there was a dog tied up. I walked back and I saw a sign saying "Snakes like walkthroughs". I then saw a black one with white bits looking at me. There was a log in the middle of the section with a small purple snake on it. I was trying to use the top of the cage as monkeybars, and then the snake left. I picked up the purple one to throw it, but it latched onto my foot. I picked at it, pulled the back of it off, but it's head and 'stinger' stayed. On my way back, I had to crawl through a section. Everything felt weird and I told them that I had been bitten by a snake. People were like 'ok'. Beyonce was a table talking to people about how "I have sex and touch myself" and I was like 'what?!'. Nana took me up to the granny-flat. Poppa was walking around.
