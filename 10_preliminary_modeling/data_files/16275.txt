I was having a kind of blah day at school and that I was going to buy some lunch, but I didn't really have any money, so I didn't. Coming back from the cafeteria, I ran into a handful of people who said they were putting on like a secret thing for Warrior Vision but it was kind of obscene and absurd. And they were keeping it a secret from Mrs. Talmadge, but Melinda thought they should tell her and ask her if they could put it on. So she took them in, most of them, but two girls went with me up somewhere into a little area that had like bathroom and then like slides and a couple things. And I had to take my clothes off to take a shower and I just sat there on a swing like type thing just talking to these two girls. And we were concerned about people coming in and seeing me, so every time somebody would come near the door, I would duck, but anyway, that was that.
