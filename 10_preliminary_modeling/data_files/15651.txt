Ezra had fallen in with a scam where he had a job doing roulette but he had to pay them. He ended up $100k in debt. We ended up outside this abandoned building. A big truck came and they were shooting through the windows of the top floor. Mom, Ezra and I were there and we hid behind something.  We were shooting back and they said that I'd shot at the truck so we had to run. I ran to go hide and they ran into the open and started shooting. There was only one guy left, but he killed them both and I was upset. I picked up a hammer and went upstairs. I shot at this guy and we both ran out of bullets so I hit him with the hammer. Then I was watching a movie and this girl fell asleep on a bed. She woke up with other people in there and they weren't threatning her, but were probably not going to let her leave.
