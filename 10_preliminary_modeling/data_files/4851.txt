I am in the back seat of a car. A couple, both with dark hair are my friends. The man is driving and the woman and I are in the backseat. We are near an ocean. I see on the left side of the road the huge prow of a ship coming up on land. 3 or 4 people are trying desperately to avoid being run over. I notice a key ring with 2 keys in my hand. I suddenly remember I hadn't taken my pills the night before or this morning. I have a moment of fear about that. I remind myself to take them when we arrive at our destination. I think its' the day (Thurs.) to eat the oatmeal but it is only Tuesday. We now turn off the coast highway and drive down hill on a small road, past other houses and so on to a house that the couple just bought. The woman watches my face for my expression. She's excited about me liking the house. I am curious and get out of the car. A small boy (theirs) is there. When the mom isn't looking, he sneaks a swig off my coke bottle. We smile and laugh together.
