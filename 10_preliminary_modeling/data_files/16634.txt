Last night I had spme pretty strange dreams. First, the one I can remember best, is that Mom and I were in the airport and we were going somewhere. Actually I can't remember where we were going. ____ leaving town as if we were going to my relative's home town. And I had to go to the bathroom, actually, we both did.  For some reason, we went in the same stall _______kind of take turns going and we chattered and took turns going______. So that's what we did in this airport dream.______ Well, we heard this message come over the intercom, talking to some other person, telling this other person that they had better go quickly, not just sit around, or the toilet would flush automatically before they were ready. And I realized that they were doing surveillance on us and they were making it so that only one person could go at a time, making it so that it would flush automatically for each person, so that I don't even know why they would have a reason to do this I guess they thought maybe somebody would either waste water or waste something _______________. But I was having her open the stall and then close it again so that it would seem like another person went in there so that I could go too, and they wouldn't know we were both in there. As I describe this, I remembered what happened before this, what led up to this. I was dreaming that Mom and Dad were home and for some reason Mom and I were both sleeping in the bedroom downstairs. And Dad was supposed to come to the bed in a little while, but he was playing his computer game or something. And it was like 11:00 at night, but Mom said, "I'm hungry. I want to go eat something." And so I suggested, "Well, we should go upstairs to my bed so that when Dad goes to bed in his bed and goes to sleep, we can get up without waking him up. Because if we stay here and he goes to sleep, when we get up, then he'll wake up." So we went up to my bed and then, I guess, before we knew it we were walking downtown to this restaurant. And it was someplace -- I don't remember where it was -- oh, it was a Chinese place. And I had, we were all kind of sharing, but I had some kind of chicken, it was like fried sesame chicken, but it was, there was something else too. And there wasa plate of something else too, some kind of meat. And I was thinking, you know, "I should have vegetables, spinach and meat and ______." And I thought "I usually have meat and a vegetable. And she said, "Oh well, it's alright." You don't have to worry about that, you have vegetables in the freezer. I couldn't really taste in this dream, but as I ate the fried chicken, I realized that there was some broccoli and some other kind of steamed vegetables in the sauce too. I can't remember what the other dish was that I had. And I think, I don't know, I thinkthe air port thing was separate, not part of the restaurant thing. And I think that's all I can remember for now.
