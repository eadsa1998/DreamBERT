Apparently I was coming home from Jackson and I had ordered some kind of book online. And for some reason they shipped a live puppy with the book and I kept thinking, "What in the world am I going to do with this puppy?" It arrived at home while we were in Jackson for another week. And somebody up in Jackson had a green bird that was dying. I think it was Aunt Christine. And Cassandra's Eloise was dead because she was sick or something, and it seemed so real. Everybody over there was so sad, and I was too. And this puppy that was supposed to have come with the book was alive barely, and I was giving her sugary cereal to eat until we get her some other food. Oh, what else? I know there was a lot more to do. Oh, and I think my birdie had just died too, as he really did a week or two ago, and we were wondering what to do with him and stuff. And that's about it, all about being dream, was this dream.
