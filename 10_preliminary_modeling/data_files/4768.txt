["Babies."] I am given the job of organizing all the babies photos. On several pages, there would be just one color photo of a baby (looking newborn) who had died. But the other pages are full of lots of photos of thriving alive babies. The woman who gave me the project is very pleased with my organization and work with the photos. She brings me a radio news story of how well I did. Later, I am given the job of organizing the children's paper dragon poster projects. I get some of the kids to bite and make designs on the edges of the papers and gather them all up to organize. I am doing a good job.
