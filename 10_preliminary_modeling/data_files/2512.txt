I am in a building and go to the Performing Arts Dept. I ask a man if I could take a quick tour rather than pay to see the concert. He hesitates and asks, "You mean like 20 minutes?" and I say "Yes." He points to a door at the left. There are four doors in a row. I stand there. He opens it and I am now standing at the top of a long stairway that goes down through the seats to an enormous area now being used as a skating rink. I think tiredly of all those stairs, but then to my surprise, its a moving escalator. We travel easily down and then around on the flat area too. I turn to the man and say, "What a relief. I usually travel in a wheelchair." We go past the stages and I peek under the curtains. "How nice," I say, "People can come here to get autographs. Are there these belts on the stage?" "Oh yes," he says. I am pleased. Disabled performers can work here too.
