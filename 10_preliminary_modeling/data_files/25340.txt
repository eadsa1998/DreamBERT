 I'm giving my dad a paper I have written, which is pinned on the bulletin board above the phone at home. It is Valentine's Day. I hug my dad and tell him I love him. As I do, I break down and start to cry. There is a toaster nest to us. My toast starts on fire! I pull it out and put the fire out. They jelly I put on the toast doesn't spread very well. My sisters Ramona and Heather, and my friend Brittany Johnson from Brimson are eating cereal with candy fruit in it. The candy fruit is like the orange jelly slices or jujy fruit candies, but is in different colors and shapes, and is bigger. It is winter. My aunt Willow Redding is there. I have to go wake up my friend Darlene Miller from Brimson so she can meet Willow before Willow leaves.
