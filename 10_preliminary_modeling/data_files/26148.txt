 I'm sitting in the driver's seat of a Suburban reading by myself. The light is dim. This is my work. I'm on top of a trailer that is connected to the Suburban. A sheet of plywood is laid across the trailer and I'm on the plywood, about a foot off the ground. I have my sleeping bag and I use it to get more comfortable on the plywood. There is potting soil on the plywood. I move it around using my credit card, using it like a trowel. My high school classmates Dan and Doug Boyle come along at separate times. They leave plants, which I hide in the dirt. They are going to come back and get the plants at about 10:00pm. There is a canoe and life vests there, on the plywood. My dad arrives. He is due here at 10:00. It's 9:52, and is quitting time. I'm working for Fishing Haven. My former boss Mike Hollow is there. My dad is talking to him. I'm going to quit this job.
