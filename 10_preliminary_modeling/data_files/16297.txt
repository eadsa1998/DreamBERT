We were at a toy store, Mom and I. It was kind of small when you first walk in, but then you go through this little door and you're in this big huge area like a real store. And we were looking for something for Bobby. I still had the notion that he's this toddler and we have to look for toys for him sometimes. I guess we always used to until he started coming of age like me. And anyway, I can't remember any specific toys that we were, anyway, I was looking around at these different toys, but I don't remember any specific ones.
