I'm in the final of an extremely short distance race. As far as I can remember, the race involves making a dash for a line that's one or two paces from the start line. There is a huge crowd gathered, but we're not in a stadium. Instead people have gathered around a square of ground where the starting official, the referee, I and my opponent are standing. They do have a modern scoreboard which is linked up to laser sensors that can detect movement to a millionth of a second. In the last round my opponent and I drew the race to exactly the same time (to a  millionth of a second). This was the re-match. I was psyching myself up for it. I had a nervous feeling in my stomach.
