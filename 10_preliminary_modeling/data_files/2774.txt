I'm in a line with my daughter Paulina. Then, I am the playwrighting class teacher, helping Jock teach the class. I've read the contest play entries and come into the classroom. No one is there. Jock is sick and the students haven't come in yet. I see Richard and we talk. I am attracted to him and he is sort of to me. I am aware he's younger. Now there is a bed in the room and I sit on it and Richard flirts and we hold hands and roll around playfully. There is some witty repartee as we "dance" with a push-pull feeling - like him or not like him, that is the question. My brother Dwight comes in and I try to introduce him to Richard and three other students that had come in late. I can't remember his name and call him Jackie and he corrects me and says Johnny. He's a bit annoyed with me. He gives me two cans of soda and his business card. I see on the card he makes wood toys and a woman says, "Oh, do you carve them with his knife or your dick?" He's leaving and retorts, "You tell me, girl." He's out the door and I wisecrack, "What a cutting remark," and laugh. He laughs and is gone. I feel a little badly that my sarcasm could be taken hurtfully (a cutting remark). A student named Nate wasn't going to be in today because his wife or girlfriend was knifed, but he shows up. I want to ask him how his girlfriend is doing, but so much is happening all at once.
