I am napping and try to wake up because I remember I've been sleeping all day and haven't changed the diaper of the baby. She's been laying in a crib all day waiting for me to wake up. Then I become aware that I am sleeping in a crib and Abner comes in and sees me asleep and puts a blanket over me. I try to tell him not to, that I am trying to wake up and get up now, but I can't wake up because I'm in such a heavy sleep.
