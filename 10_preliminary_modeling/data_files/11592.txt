In the following dream I was lying on my bed in my own bedroom and at the time I was dreaming I was not sure whether I was awake or asleep. I lay on my bed for a while and then heard someone coming up the stairs to my room. I tried to call out and ask who it was but was unable to speak. The footsteps slowly came closer and at last entered my bedroom. I saw the person, evidently a man, and was overcome with fear. I tried to get up to get to my gun rack which is just outside my bedroom door, but I was unable to move. Finally, just before I awoke, I was released from the spell and dashed to my gunrack. I took out a rifle and turned to face the unknown visitor, only to find that it was a small boy who was greatly concerned over my apparent desire to harm him. I felt rather foolish at becoming so terrified at the presence of such a small child and then woke up.
