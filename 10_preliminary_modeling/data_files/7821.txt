Grandma F had just died. We were in the house taking down pictures and things off the wall because some people wanted to take things of hers home with them right away. We knew that we needed to put most of the things together and save it until we came back to formally divide up all of there things. I was walking around looking for a picture. Then we decided we would go in a room where we took everything down and put it in one room, that we would just go in there and took turns selecting one thing. I was upset because the two pictures I wanted most, BJ had taken already. I ended up taking a picture of a farm with a barn and cow on it. I thought it was kind of cool and reminded me of her. It was one of the ones I remember most looking at when I was back there. While we were dividing these things up, some other people kept brining some other stuff in this room. We had to keep asking them to carry it back because it was stuff we were saving until we had our formal division of property.
