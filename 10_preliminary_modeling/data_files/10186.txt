Long dream about Earl (friend from the Retreat Center). We sit and talk about our feelings; we are close and I want us to be more than friends; I try to kiss him but he moves away; "It's not so simple" he says; He wants me to make a clear decision: either E. or J., but I cannot, or don't want to make that decision; I ask "Can't we be friends and also...?" "No" he moves away; later we walk and talk some more, but he still insists I make a clear cut decision, but I only want to hug and kiss.
