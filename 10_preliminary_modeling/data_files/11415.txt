I was in a large room which contained a large number of desks. It also seemed that there was quite a number of people, however I cannot say definitely. Someone then gave me a paper which apparently was an examination (final) for a course in which I had no knowledge whatsoever. Then, upon thrashing the thing over in my mind, I remembered having signed up for the course at the beginning of the term. I never attended a class or the subject throughout the semester. At this point I was awakened.
