Millie has come to visit me. I ask how many days will she stay. She says, "Only one night and two days." I am disappointed. I say, "We could do this or that." She just wants to hang out looking out the window. She says, "Do you see the dinosaur?" A hillside looks like the shape of a dinosaur. I say, "Look at that one. It looks like an iguana or Gila monsters. She says she can only stay a short time because her garden is growing fast now and she never needs to tend it. We go outside to see the garden. She points out row after row of plants and names each one. I say, confused, "Did you bring your garden here?" She says, "No, I know I don't have a garden." We decide it belongs to the big farm owner (like Breeden Brothers).
