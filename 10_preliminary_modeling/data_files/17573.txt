I dreamt we were leaving a place.  There were perhaps four of us.  A girl...Valerie?  Victoria?  Was driving- MY car in a parking lot.  She stopped short, and started to roll into another car.  I told her flat out I didn't want her driving my car, to get out.  She wouldn't.  Somehow they separated from me, and when they came back I had to hear about how my poor Volvo was totaled.
