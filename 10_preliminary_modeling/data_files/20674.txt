I worked at a printing shop. I was told that I was too slow, so I left the job. Later I recalled leaving a book there which I had been reading. I looked for the building. It housed a department store. I found the building, but I couldn't find the stairs leading to the shop. It was on the 8th or 9th floor. I climbed a wall to get to the shop. When I reached the window of the shop, I had a sudden fear of falling. A man was there, and told me not to think about what I was doing. I tried thinking of something else, and I wasn't afraid any more. (Comment: Yesterday I was told that I was being sent to Staff today.)
