I don't know who the people were, but someone was trying to break into the apartment. In the dream I was thinking to myself, OK, please God, help me get out of this bed and to the door in time to get to the bedroom door on time so I can lock it. If they could break in through the front door, I don't know why I thought they couldn't break in through my bedroom door. I was in one of those states where I couldn't move, and then I woke up. Then I went back to sleep. This time it was a group of maintenance people from the apartment community. I even had the front door chained. First they came up to the neighbor's front door and mine. They were banging on them with their fists. That alone scared me because it was during the night. I couldn't imagine why anyone would be banging on my door like that in the middle of the night. I was worried that something was very wrong but I still didn't want to go down and answer it because I didn't know who it was or what they wanted. I later found out it was the maintenance guys. They managed to get in. I don't know if they managed to break the chain or if they got it off or what they did with it. I was lying on my right side so I couldn't see if someone came in my bedroom without moving, but I was sure they had come in. I felt them standing by my bed behind me. I didn't move, hoping they would think I was asleep and leave me alone. I woke up again. When I went back to sleep this time I knew someone was breaking into the apartment, but I didn't know who it was. They didn't make a lot of noise I just knew that someone had gotten in and was on their way upstairs. I was lying on my right side again, so again, I couldn't see if someone entered the room or not. This time I wasn't sure but I was too afraid to turn to see.
