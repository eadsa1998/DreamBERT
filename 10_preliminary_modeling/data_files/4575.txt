["Morning pancakes with my blind friends."] I am sleeping over at friends house. I am in a small bed, which is the only furniture in the room. I wake up and see Dwan cooking pancakes. She puts lots of butter on the pancake and slides it back and forth on the grill as the butter melts. Then she flips the pancake with her hand. They look very tasty. I want one. Lucy and Mirabelle are in the other room visiting.
