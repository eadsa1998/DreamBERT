There was an update on FilmForum to fix a bug that had been around for 6 months. Alessandro had a presentation of some features using movies he had watched as he went and I forgot what I had watched. There was a scene of a movie with Leonardo Dicaprio and Martin Scorsese at a table. Leonardo had to break in, but was welcomed. Scorsese was swearing and talking. The angle changed and someone's head got blown off from "poison" and you could see inside like a rubber mask and I thought it was awesome. Later I was with Dad and Ezra to get dinner. It was night. We parked and Dad and I crossed the road. A car was coming and I told Dad to stop but he said he was going to go. I was going to show him the scene after we got food. There was a little path with a fence and a guy asked if we could come with him but he seemed dodgy and Dad said no and he started to follow us and I was like "Dad?!" There was a door so we went over there and there was an empty room with no roof. The guy reached over the wall and I grabbed his arm and twisted it -- I was really strong. There was a place called '92'. Food appeared in the corner. I was talking about the scene and a young guy said "he's gay" and I asked what he meant and he said Scorsese's character was gay. I said I didn't get that at all and he said he was "too emotional and human-y". Mom was waiting there too. There was something about The Virgin Spring and Goodfellas. At the end of Inception, Iko Iko was playing but it was weird with sounds and laughter in the background.
