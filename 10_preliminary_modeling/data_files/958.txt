My grandmother Mildred is ill. She is dying. She wants grandpa Lloyd with her. We are in the living room. I see grandfather coming in to see her. He is younger looking and thin. He smiles and looks like he's gone through some emotional changes, like he's finally in touch with his feelings. Grandma is scared and needs his support. He knows that and gives her a present and talks about how he'd love to be there with her but he just can't, so much to do, etc. He talks like her and I look at my parents and think, "See you all ways got on her case but she learned it from him." He's trying to do the polite thing and escape. She's practically begging him to be real and close with her. It's like grandfather has just discovered warmth and youth and knows he hasn't long to enjoy it and is insensitive to her and wants to leave her. He starts to leave. I am angry. I run after him and grab him at the porch. A younger cousin (with eyes like my kitty), wants to talk to him and gets there first. I say, "Grandfather, I want to talk with you." He says, "Well, I have to leave now, and he was here first." I look at the cousin and look at him, silently pleading for him to understand my need and then say to grandfather, "How can you do this to her?!" I then feel empathy and say, "I know you need XXX. I know you XXX, but she needs you. How can you be so cruel to her?" He's walking to the car and I'm following, crying, "Grandfather! Grandfather!," and sobbing. He won't listen. He's on his way.
