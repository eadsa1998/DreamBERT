Suddenly I was in an elegant room with elegant people there. Then I was with my friends at the university (they are 5 girls and one boy). When we were all seated, they started serving the dishes. At one point they told a joke to one of my classmates and she responded to it. A classmate from the university kissed her on the face several times and then lifted one who was at his side and wanted to trade places. My friend Mary asked for help, but the boy who kissed her fainted. This man wanted to hurt her with a fork. I took away all the knives and forks, but he tore her dress. I hugged her, but a little later I realized it was not she but a three-year-old kid whom I first gave water to and then liquor. Everybody looked for the man, but he didn't appear. I went to the neighbor's house and the kid I had belonged to the lady. She was angry and said that her son would have been better off with her, but my mother had taken him away. Then we all got together to see the man coming down from the roof, but that didn't happen since the one who came down was the boy from the university.
