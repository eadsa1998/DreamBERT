Kolesar, Fisher and I were going hunting. Kolesar got 3 fifth of whiskey. He gave me one, Fisher one and we were on W. 25th Street. Two hillbilly kids were bothering Fisher. I saw him swing at the kids with his bottle. I went out to help and then one rowdy boy was bothering me. I finally got into the car. We were driving slowly. Kolesak was driving my car. The kid pulled a knife. I got hold of it and I was cutting the rope he had fastened to the car, and he put his hand in the way so I could not cut the rope, but I did and it seemed as though I cut his hand, but I didn't. I saw #238 and another number I can't recall now.
