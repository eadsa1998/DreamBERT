I was watching a movie and Stanley Kubrick was directing it. It was set out the back of Nana's. I was discussing the movie with Stanley Kubrick and he asked me how pretty I thought the main character, Joanne, was out of 10. I said a 3. I was then taking over as the main character and it was real. Her boyfriend (now mine and I didn't like him) took me and it was raining. The rain was dangerous so he took me to the granny flat which was made of metal. I slipped down the path. Poppa and others were in the garage. Simba and some other cats were in the room. I was telling Ezra about Duck Soup and how everything the main character says is funny.
