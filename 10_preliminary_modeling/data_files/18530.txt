It was time to go Christmas shopping. We went to the grocery store. Me and Rudy and Dora. We were looking for a Christmas present for my father. Dora said (that) it should still be in the box, so he'd be down there waiting. We also picked out some strange Chinese vegetables but by the time (that) we got there ??? going bald. Then there was a cone-shaped wrapper with sea shells in it (that) you were suppose to boil. It cost $4.11. I thought it was too expensive. One was $7.87. I thought Rudy would like the pot pie, regular style, but Dora said smiling calm, "We should pick something the whole family will like." So we picked out a brand new color TV, still in the cardboard box. "Leave it in the box so (that)my father will have something to open on Christmas morning," Dora said. In the meantime, I picked out a gray champion sweatshirt. It was $4.00. I was extremely happy with my purchase. We needed to watch the editing and there were 2 versions. It was black and white; tall gangly model girls with slicked back hair, draping their arms and legs over the arms of chairs in a very slouched way. They looked bored but thought (that) they looked compelling. Mary said, "It's the same footage regular size and then blown up so big (that) you can't tell what it is. Do you see yourself?" I said, "No." She said, "I've got to do it over anyway.
