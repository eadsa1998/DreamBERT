 I'm at a dentist-like office. A woman is going to examine me. We talk about my weight. I'm lying on my back in the chair. I have a pair of clear plastic glasses on. I say that I've lost weight: I've grown accustomed to eating less. I tell someone I weight 210 pounds, and they believe me. Then I tell them I don't really weight 210, but really weight 175. She makes a comment on my nutrition, saying I need to eat more.
