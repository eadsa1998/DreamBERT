This dream took place in back of my home. I was in the army and defending the area against the Japanese, or some Asian group. There were six or seven other soldiers with me, and I remember several of them were my friends here at school. I went out into the field before me which extended about 40 yards before the ground level rises to form a hill. It seems that the enemy was located on the other side of the hill. I was very frightened, in a feeling of helplessness more than real fear. I no sooner started out than I could see the enemy beginning to advance. I quickly went back to the rest of the group to stand off the attack. I took my rifle and began shooting at the enemy. I shot them with no effect and I found that I had not taken the safety off the gun. Now I was out of ammunition, as I borrowed some from the soldiers around me. Now when I shot, the advancing enemy would be killed. The other soldiers now seemed to be doing very little and I was defending the whole group. The enemy soldiers would almost get to me and I would kill them. I had no moral compunctions about killing them, but a feeling of to kill or be killed, along with a feeling that they were making me kill them. Finally I had killed enough so that the remainder retreated. As soon as the enemy retreated, three men came up to me and said to one another, "this is the one," pinning a medal on me. I felt good but that turned to fear, like now every one of the enemy would be out to get me. Our group then retreated back to our house. A new group of the enemy attacked from the rear, but I saw them soon enough to give warning and avert a surprise attack. At this point I killed a man with my bare hands (a knife that is). This being the first time I had ever done anything like this. I viewed his body afterwards, and felt no pity whatsoever. Then the dream changed into some other theme.
