 I'm driving a van into the parking lot at Scott Junior High in Wilmerton. I park the van funny, across the yellow painted lines designating parking spaces. I adjust the parking job by driving and rolling the van into the spot while I am outside of the van. It seems like walking along a bicycle. We go into the school. I'm wearing my bush hat and some other outrageous clothes, including a feather cloth around my neck. I walk towards the office. I see my high school science teacher Mr. Grizzly. I stop and talk with him, asking him if he's been to the Big Resort Area lately. He says that it's been tough to go with diapers, baby food, etc. I think he must have a baby, and then I realize he is talking about me! I laugh. I tell him I got a job in the Big Resort Area this summer. A boy in the corner makes a comment. I walk out of the room. My cousins Rich and Melvin Redding are there. I shake Rich's hand and pat Melvin's head. I hear that a boy from my neighborhood named Chris has died. I leave. I go by my Brimson classmate Molly and others. I go out the front door. There is a ship-like hearse and the casket is like a boat. A woman is directing three men. The men are putting the casket in the holder, and she is telling them how to secure it. I watch this as I walk past my van. I turn around and go back to the van.
