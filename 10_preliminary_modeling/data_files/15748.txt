There were these big bubbles and I was filming Spaceman eating them in slow motion. They were thick bubbles, so it took a few seconds to burst. Then, it was Rover and he was trying to get this bug in the corner of this ledge up high. Suddenly, this bat grabbed his head and latched on. I was freaking out and poking it with a stick and trying to get it off.
