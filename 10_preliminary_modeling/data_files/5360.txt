I first dreamed that Sue and I lived on Bundy 3 and we wanted to go work out. I couldn't find shorts, but finally I did. I grabbed chapstick and my iPod and went to work out. While I was in the shower, Delia asked me to watch Zoey playing tennis downstairs. I thought that was really weird, and didn't care about going to watch tennis. I went home and got online. I was stuck online all night, and I just couldn't sign off --it was very frustrating. Then, all of a sudden, I was in Spain again with my family and I had to tell this Spanish guy a story about a man who ordered salmon, but really wanted soup, and had to change his order. I remember having a lot of trouble conjugating decir. So then our whole group was in Slate, which was in a huge hospital in the center of Madrid. Valerie was with Tom. We all had to shower in these old bathtubs before catching our flight home. When we got into the shower, I realized that I didn't have shampoo or conditioner or anything. I went through a mirror to get out and found myself in the middle of the hospital. I kept running around trying to find Slate so that I could catch my flight. My father was there too because he was trying to give me my mail before I left. And my brother was there too. We all started to climb this really unsteady driftwood ladder. We all fell, but my father caught me, and I was supposed to catch my brother, but I missed, and he fell so far. He just kept falling and falling and falling and cracked his skill when he hit the ground. I was crying so hard. We tried to bring him to the ER. He ended up going blind, never to play hockey again. I woke up because I was crying! Ahh!
