We had left our seats in the rear row and returned to find them gone. I drew back a seat further and told the others to do so. We are hearing a lecture on personal relations in dealing with workers to come from the other islands. In the large sitting room they were here and the three year old girl was crying loudly. I ask her mother why and we try to quiet her. Then my mother takes the child away.
