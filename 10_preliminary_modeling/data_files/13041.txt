Dad and I, and sometimes Ezra, went to some weird place for a movie. It was called Freaksville or something. These two pale kids were hanging around. They kept annoying me. One was smoking and I was complaining about their parents and one started crying. I calmed them down. One of them was my age and the other was 17. One looked like a toddler but was 18. These people gave us these cakes and they had onion in them. All the food had onion in them. We were all in water. The guy my age choked on a toothpick and no-one knew and he sank underwater. He said that he saw an image. He managed to get above the surface. The 17 year old had only a few days to shoot his role in the movie as he started school soon. Mom and Ezra came somewhere near there later. They saw Roland's car in the bush. There was this party thing. This lady was doing a quiz. She or someone knew all the answers. The guy who was my age had become a playboy but regarded me as his best friend. I was hoping he wasn't Ethan Hawke because he's ugly.
