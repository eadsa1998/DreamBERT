I was in the army? We were at a shop. We all had to hand in DNA samples because they were going to randomize it and make babies. One person was black and another was Michael C. Hall. I was watching some show with Morena Baccarin. In season one, she had dark, golden skin and had a baby at the end. The baby was like 8 years old in season 2.
