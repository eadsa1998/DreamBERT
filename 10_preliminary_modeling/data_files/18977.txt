In this dream I dreamt that I was where I am right now, and that the doctor was a little mad because he couldn't get a good reading on me because my sleep was erratic or something. And George was coming to my defense about my sleep pattern. And I remember seeing that machine in there, but it was in here. The disagreement was between George and Dr. Hall mainly, and I was just sort of sitting back observing all this.
