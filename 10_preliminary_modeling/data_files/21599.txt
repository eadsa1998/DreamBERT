There was someone attacking our home. I was walking thru a field to come at them thru the rear. I saw a man walking towards me. I paid no attention to him, but then I saw another man from the opposite direction coming towards me and I had a feeling of being hunted and run down. I walked fast, but the two men were closing in on me. When they came close, I started to run. They kept on coming closer and closer and one man had a wire rope in his hand. They were right behind me and I was very nervous, expecting to be brought down by the wire rope around me. I met Margie S. I kissed her on the cheek and a little on the lips. She had a baby. We were playing some kind of game with play cards. A storm came up and started to blow away the game chips, so I put them away. We were down in the basement. I came to some kind of party. Two men tried to attack me for my wallet of money I had in my pocket. I kept them off, then climbed up above them.
