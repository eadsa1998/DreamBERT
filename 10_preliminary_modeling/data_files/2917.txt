I have two automons, robots. One is Data from Star Trek. We go visit a man who is weeping at the loss of his beloved wife who he nursed through her illness. I sob in tremendous grief that, because I don't have a beloved, I shall die alone. No one will care for me when I become ill. My mother is annoyed and does not understand why I cry.
