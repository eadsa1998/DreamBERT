 I'm in the house with others looking at photographs. There are some photographs of my brother Wally when he was little. I'm in some of the photographs too, but not prominently. There is a photograph of my high school classmate Carol Derth taking a photograph down her pants, of her crotch area. I'm with Carol in a room talking. Her brother and father are somewhere in the east, like Indonesia. She gets to visit them every weekend because she and they have friends who are very rich and fly there all the time. She has a ranch in Colorado that someone left her in a will. There is a big bar there. My friend Kevin Simpson mixes a drink with a green bottle. I taste it. It tastes good. I remember Carol has a disease.
