In my dream I pondered on the suicide -- in real life -- of a patient on the ward where I was given a work assignment about a year ago. His name was Maggorio. He was an elderly man with a kind disposition. He had been confined there about 30 years. There was a minor charge against him, and it was dropped about 10 years ago, but the civil hospital did not accept his request for a transfer. He felt despondent because his eyesight was failing. I heard about his suicide the day before this dream. I felt a deep sense of pity for him. In the dream I was in a park staring at some railroad tracks nearby. Later children were there.
