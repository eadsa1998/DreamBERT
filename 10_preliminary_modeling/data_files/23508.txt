I am at a disco which is very mixed black and white. There is darkness, flashing lights, smoke -- a bar scene near the water. But there is some sort of trouble, some illegal gambling/mob scene on the go, and the cops come and take away the whites. As I am dragged away, I search for and call for Bob, and I see his face above the crowd -- but either he doesn't see me or he won't help me -- I can't get to him, and I know he will stay and party with his people. I am out on the street.
