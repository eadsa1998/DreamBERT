I am in a room. Mabel and several other women are there. I walk past them to talk with a man. One woman asks me why I chose to ignore Mabel and talk to the man, and why I am angry and being sarcastic. I feel angry that she accuses me of this and begin to explain that I wasn't angry. I simply wanted to talk to the man. I realize as I'm talking that the woman is right, and I feel caught and embarrassed. I take a deep breath and, still angry, I try to be honest. I say, "I apologize if I offended or hurt. I have old habits that I learned from my parents." I go on to explain about my mother, her anger and indirect ways of expression. I say, "I'm trying to change."
