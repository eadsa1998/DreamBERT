I had one long complicated nightmare which I've forgotten - but I was awaiting conviction for a murder which I had done - it was for political reasons, but so as not to give the cause away, I was making it look as tho' I had killed a man who was trying to assault me - &amp; I felt awful about having to make it look that way because he was married &amp; I knew his wife must feel so shocked &amp; betrayed. The dream was the trial, but that's all I remember of it.
