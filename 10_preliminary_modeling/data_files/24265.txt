I was prepping for a huge test. Everyone had to take it. It was like a post-college SAT. Like the GRE. I felt like I'd destroy it. Utterly conquer it. So I didn't take it seriously. Before the test, the school decided to throw a "relax" festivity party with football and soccer, with all you can eat buffets. I tried to play multiple games. The other guys were fast in football, but I thought I had a good chance. I began playing. I told them, just snap it to me and we'll see what happens. The snap came from a guy named Shod; fat black guy who I played basketball with in high school. It was a bad snap. I had to run to go get the ball when it went over my shoulder. They were on me faster than I thought, but I still got a lot of yards. I decided to get a hotel to stay and study the night before the test. It was instantly cut short, leaving us to wait and mill around in a cafe room with high-top tables. Nora, Shaun's girlfriend (Shaun is a friend from college who I recently visited), came on to me. I was sharing a room with her at the hotel I checked out. We were in various states of undress. I could feel the heat and slick of her wet parts. She was rubbing on me. I evidently said "forget it" and she was sad.
