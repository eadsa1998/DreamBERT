Mary and I are in the kitchen. Mary is working on something in the blender. The phone rings and I answer it. The phone is on the same wall as the table holding the blender. But there is a partition between the phone and table. When I answer the phone, I can't see Mary because she is hidden by the partition. The blender is making so much noise that I can barely hear the person on the other end of the line. I call out to Mary, asking her to turn off the blender. There is no response. I call again, and still no response. So I look behind the partition. Mary is kneeling on a chair. Her head is down and it is pressed against the wall. For a split second I think that she is unusually concentrated on her work with the blender. But in a flash I realize something is terribly wrong. I tell whoever is on the phone that I have an emergency and can't talk, and hang up. I go to Mary and take her in my arms. She had fainted, and the wall is soaking wet where her head had struck it when she had lost consciousness. I can't tell whether it is blood or sweat. Mary's eyes are fluttering, although she is out cold. She is moaning slightly. I call 911 for an ambulance. The dream ends where I am cradling Mary in my arms. I don't know whether we are in the kitchen awaiting the arrival of the ambulance, or are in the ambulance on our way to the hospital. In this dream Mary appeared as she had before taking ill. There was no indication that the illness was wasting away her body.
