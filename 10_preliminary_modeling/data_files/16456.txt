I had to take three more classes at Westport College this summer and they were going to be like theory classes and like fun stuff, almost like art classes. And I was deciding which ones they would be. And I dreamt that Dad had this, either a violin or a dulcimer or a mandolin or something that he found either at a garage sale or in the dumpster, and he taught himself to play it. I can't remember what song it was, but he was trying to teach himself, "Oh Shenandoah." And he was also, he knew "This Land is Your Land," and I was feeling his fingers and how they were moving while he was playing it, and I was thinking, "Wow, isn't this cool? I thought he would never learn such a thing." And he was going to teach me, but I was kind of embarrassed at first, I don't know why. And this dream mostly consisted of those notions, and sitting out in the front yard and watching Dad play his instrument, whatever it was. And then I was in this big yellow room again and Mom was asking me what kind of classes was I going to take. And I remember she was saying it was okay if I took an online class, because I think I've still got it in the back of my head that I would rather take that music theory class than speech because it's an online thing. And that's pretty much it in a nutshell.
