We were sitting in a circle and were to read a verse around from the Bible. I was slow opening my Bible and Father sitting next to me showed me the passage in Ephesians but I couldn't find it and he nodded to the next to read but she sang something instead. I explained my slowness in locating passage by the fact that I had forgotten that my Bible contained the Apochrypha. I started to church but when I got there it was entirely empty. As I had stopped to talk, I was 15 minutes late. I went to the Parish House and found some people there. The leader said there were no more classrooms but groups met in different parts of the auditorium.
