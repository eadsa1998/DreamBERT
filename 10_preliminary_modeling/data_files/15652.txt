I was at home, out the front. There was a big van and I was poking around in the back and I took some stuff out. They went to drive off but the back wasn't closed and I ran after it trying to close it. They were heading towards the church and I was sitting on a log at the corner of the street and I was thinking if someone hit them I would die. The car slammed into them and it flipped over. I was shocked and I went and told Mom and Ezra. They went to go sort some stuff out. Then it was night and I was at home but it was different. I went out to the lounge room and it was dark. I turned the kitchen light on and it was flickering, then I turned on the dining room light and it flickered as well. I realised I was in a dream and I closed my eyes and blocked my nose. I opened my eyes again and the lights were on and there were 2 TVs and a big gaming console. Mom and Ezra were walking up to the front door. Later, I was at a shop and some people were acting dodgy. A girl and I escaped and she forgot her purse. A door was closing downwards and I quickly kicked it out. She left it and we ran. We got in a car and this girl (who was one of the bad guys) was standing in front of the car. I accelerated and hit her and her head got stuck under the wheel. There was blood everywhere. I got home and I was worried that I wouldn't be able to go to England.
