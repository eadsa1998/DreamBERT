I'm at work, sort of - lunch hour or break, I think. The "library" is in some kind of warehouse-y place, a number of things under one roof, including this little shop, or kiosk, really, that sells cutesy decorative things, gewgaws. It's run by a couple of women and mostly staffed by them, very suburban-businesswoman, you know the type, that wear tasteful flowered dresses, they're on the tall side and very well-groomed. And slightly mean. They have a young guy working for them, kind of a stock boy/clerk, and while I'm there I talk to him. The others are somewhere nearby. I'm particularly interested in some miniature kitchen tools they have, they're mostly plastic but I have something in mind that they'd be useful for, and I'll probably buy some. Especially I like the little measuring-spoon set - it's like mine, only different colors (mostly red though). I'm looking for more in the next bin. On the main bin there was a sign that said "$5 for all", and I'm not sure it means $5 for one complete set of these, or $5 apiece (unlikely - they're just cheap little plastic things), or $5 for the entire bin. I believe I'll ask, but as I turn back towards it, the sign's gone, and the boy is putting things away because they're closing up. He's not sure what to tell me, either, but says he can ask the others. I tell him not to bother, and start back for the (library). I am nearby to a back door, the heavy sort with a bar you press down. Becky Crow's just coming in this door with several large cold-drink cups. She's picked them up for her staff - some are drinks, some smoothies, and there's too much of them for her to manage and the door too. I offer to help, taking a couple off her hands, and she asks if I'll take them down to Lisa, who's just coming around the corner at the end of the "hallway". She stops at this cart sort of thing, and I bring her these drinks while Becky gets reorganized.
