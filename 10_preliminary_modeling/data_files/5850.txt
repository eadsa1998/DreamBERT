[1997-08-16] I dreamt of a job I had, years and years and years ago. I was working in a factory, making gears for printing press machines, which is what I did years ago. I can remember loading the machine, and these gears were made out of brass and I remember putting the gears on and these gears made a real mess because you didn't use oil on them to make them, they were just there to dry. I remember starting the machine and saying "something's wrong, the oil pump's not on." So I turned the oil pump on and what a mess that made! We had oil and brass chips all over the place and I remember having to get all the equipment out of there and having to clean it all up. Finally, as I began to wake up I remember thinking, wondering how did this bed get there, and because the window was open, how did all these sounds get there and it was pretty confusing for about 2 or 3 minutes.
