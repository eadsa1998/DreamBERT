I told R. I hoped they'd make some repairs on my apartment. At least they should fix the uneven card table legs. Try them and think they'd not be so bad if they could be unfolded better. Then there's the closet door to fix. But I find it has no door only a fine velvet curtain which I feel. One side is plain color, the other is flowered. R. tells the little child she'll make her a table cloth for her doll from the black velvet material on which she is sewing. I say, "But you had a square already here," and I look for it but can't find it. Even when R. leaves and I shake out the material yard by yard, I can't find it.
