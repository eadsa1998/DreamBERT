I'm in my van and I see I'm near Rita H's house. I decide to visit. I drive backwards up a little hill and over gravelly stones. Her house is very tiny. I see her in the kitchen. She is all pink, even her hair. She's talking with some older woman. I apologize for interrupting. I am aware she's hiding someone in another room and I don't want to make trouble for her.
