I was home, for some reason, and Daddy was there-very much alive.  [He died in September.]  I was amazed, and I asked Mother about it.  She said that when they were lowering the casket into the grave, he suddenly sat up, and was alive.  I didn't know what to think.  I asked if he had not been really dead but only in suspended animation or something.  She said no, the doctor had said he definitely was dead.  Then I could only believe it was a miracle.  I prayed to God and thanked Him for such a great thing, and I promised that I would always do right in return for it; but as I made the promise, I thought of an incident in which I had caressed Hillary's breasts, and I knew deep in my heart that, regardless of my gratitude, I would never be able to forego such pleasure.
