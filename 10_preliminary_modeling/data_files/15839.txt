I was watching a film about this guy whose daughter had died from some illness when she was about 8 or so. Not sure what happened to his wife, but he started dating this woman and he never talked about his past with her. Sometimes it switched between being 'first person view' from the woman and it being a film. While 'I' was the woman, I was at his house and this young girl came up and started talking to me. She was a bit mysterious with the way she spoke but I gathered she was his daughter. He couldn't see her though. Then I started seeing his wife too. Something happened and he went crazy and he started killing people. But it was like an interactive movie, so you were experiencing the kills as well. The lighting was all weird, like dark but red and then blue etc. He was crying and crazed looking and had a knife and he was slicing up his wife and this other woman. Even once they were dead, he was just slicing and slicing. He killed the daughter as well. Then a baby started crying and he went to kill it. Then I was in like a cinema watching it and a lady behind me was snivelling. I thought she was stupid for finding it sad and I was impressed at how intense and immersive it was.
