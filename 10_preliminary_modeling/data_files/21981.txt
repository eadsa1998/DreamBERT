I saw Steve Lasko at a distance and I waved at him. He waved back. Then Albert Lasko came over to where I was and we played some kind of a game on a board. I had a partner and so did Al. We won one game and he and his partner won a game. I was running after a young lady who was running away from me. I caught her and was loving, kissing and hugging her. Then she got away from me and I had to sneak up on her. I also was the watching party. I saw myself sneaking on a drawing. I finally got to a position by a railroad station. I saw the girl and made off I was wounded and fell to the ground and she ran up to me. I embraced her and kissed her. She got up and moved away, but came back and we embraced and kissed.
