I am walking home through the town next to the town where I grew up and I cut through a yard on First Street and over a wall. Four men chase me. One in particular, although I don't know his name. I learn somehow although I keep running that he won't press trespassing charges if I marry him. I go to a house where a female friend actually lives but someone else I know lives there. I don't know who that someone is. I call home for a ride even though I know I will catch hell. Something about poison is also involved. A man (who is actually my insurance agent) answers the phone. I tell him about being scared and he asks if I don't have some relative who is involved in insurance investigation. I say yes (my son-in-law) and I tell the man he (son-in-law) is thinking about getting insurance investigation but he is actually doing something different. The dream ends so I don't know if I get a ride home. The initials RLP come after I am awake. They are the initials of the man chasing me.
