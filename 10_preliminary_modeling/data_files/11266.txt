I was at John Adam's football field watching a game. The seats in front of me were vacant, but sitting on my right side was a man and his girlfriend. The thing I remember most about the man was that he was extremely handsome. During the game two friends of mine came in (male) and sat in front of us. The man next to me asked if these two people (both 24) were from John Adams, and I told him they were. He said that it was too bad because John Adams couldn't win the championship because for some reason he didn't give, John Adams was to be disqualified from competition. Here the dream ended.
