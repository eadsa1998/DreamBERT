My brother Stuart committed suicide. I didn't understand why.  Afterwards I was in a sort of cafeteria, talking to my old friend Candy and her mom Dena.  Candy was eating ice cream from a plastic wine glass and speaking to me in Spanish.  I went down to the beach where the suicide had been.  There was a line of men walking by, and one of them suddenly grew to be about twice as big as the others.  I was to figure out why.  There was a demonstration regarding trial air tanks for snorkeling, and somehow this was the cause.  I tried their little air tanks.  It worked at first, but water started to leak in.  I came up after inhaling some water. Then somehow it was like a 'do-over' and Stuart was going to kill himself again.  I talked to him first. He told me that he would leave his life in our (the family's) hands. I told him not to. He was planning to die by some sort of injection. I yelled at him trying to convince him not to. I said, "If you're dead, then what's the purpose? You wouldn't be able to cuddle Sheila [his girlfriend] anymore.."  His retort was, "What, feel her up? I'm not completely horny. I'm happy just to be in her presence." and then he continued on with the attempt. Sure he was leaving his life in our hands.  I was angry.  Something happened with the injection and he bled to death instead.  A little later, I was sitting on a log. He came and sat down next to me. I asked what it was like for him to be dead, if he was happy now.  I guess we had a sort of wake party, with lots of food.
