Ezra was abducted by aliens and was taken to the moon. Later, Mom and I ended up there. That was a big golf course and I was wondering about golf ball complaints. The people that had taken Ezra had a group and all the members had to have a middle name beginning with 'Y'. There were cat uniforms. I went to join and there was a Year 12 guy from school. Some people died 700km in the air and they were asleep? People were falling off the moon. I got abducted too. Calvin, Elijah and Silas were there too. We went on some bumper cars. We stuffed them up so we left. There was some game in the water called Squidder. My nose was burning and I smelled this soup thing. Nana was there. There was a game where you shoot a brick and then you put it into this thing. There was a German girl and her middle name began with an 'H'.
