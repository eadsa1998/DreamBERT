 I'm in a big old house in Metropolis. I walk up flights of stairs, heading for the attic. The house has a hippie-esque quality to it, with pastel tie-dyed items displayed. My aunt Willow Redding lives here. My sister Heather has come her to get something, maybe help or advice, from Willow. In the attic my mom is working on the floorboards. I sit down. The boards are not nailed in place. Some boards flip up. My mom and I put them back in order as best we can. There is a space underneath the floorboards.
