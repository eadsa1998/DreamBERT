A group of us are looking at this house we want to rent. It certainly looks good, just my sort of place - old, well furnished, great shape - nice stuff, good wood furniture. We look at the living room and a couple of bedrooms. I'm wondering where the 3rd bedroom can be - I guess we may have to make do somehow, but really however good it looks, it may just be too small for us. But then the rental agent takes us through another door to a hallway, and here's other rooms - actually quite a number of them, it turns out - this place is much bigger than we thought, too big really, but at this price, my word, this is too good to be true - I love this house, it's just gorgeous.
