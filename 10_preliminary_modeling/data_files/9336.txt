I was in the town where I grew up, but my present age, on a screened porch my father slept on. Outside the window, two girls, strangers to me, about 16 years old, played this game: "This is the way my boyfriend kisses me," and one girl kissed the other. "This is the way my boyfriend squeezes my breasts," and the other girl squeezed ... many giggles from both. "This is the way my boyfriend humps me." My father is standing beside the bed, my mother in it suddenly; he is bashful about sex.
