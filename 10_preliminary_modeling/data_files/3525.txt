Derek is laying on the ground, on his belly, up on his arms and I am laying on my back. We are just talking. Then he leans over me and kisses me. I am startled and pleased, but don't know quite what to do or think, because it was so clear this wasn't going to be a part of our relationship. I can't quite believe it all. I wait, hugging him slightly to see if this continues or if it was just a "stray" kiss. He continues, obviously now indicating we will be lovers.
