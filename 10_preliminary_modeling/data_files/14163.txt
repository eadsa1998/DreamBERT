I was driving with Mom and Ezra and I was in the back. There were all these people on the street and I said they were "Pettigrew's". They all looked like Jason Bateman and his last name was Pettigrew. The kids looked like Emery though. There was a list of Superman movies and one of them had a black Superman. I went to this old lady's house and she gave us drugs. She said they were really strong and asked me if I was ok because she had seen some silly photos of me the other day.
