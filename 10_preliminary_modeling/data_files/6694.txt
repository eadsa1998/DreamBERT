A man is in our office. He is to give us some autobiographical material. I ask the secretary if I should ask him for his baby picture. He hands me a long paper. It is translucent and somewhat sticky. (Had been working with stamp collection.) It sticks to my fingers. It will take long to read it. I tell him I will read it at some other time, but I'm expecting a pupil at 9:30 and I've not had any breakfast yet. (Nola, a pupil, does come at that hour.) So I go into another room. I want a shower first. I am not fully dressed. Someone is in the tub with the shower curtain drawn but her arm shows. Another woman is there. I tell them I want the shower very soon since my pupil is due at 9:30, but I start to look for things to prepare my breakfast. I can do some of it first. I go into a third room. There is a tub in it too. I can not think why I can not use it.
