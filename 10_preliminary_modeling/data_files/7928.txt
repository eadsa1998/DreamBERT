Kendall B came to visit but we were once again at my birth home. Mother and Daddy were there. He was very out-going. Shortly after he arrived he took all of his clothes off because he liked to be naked around the house. We were going to sit and talk about my dissertation but we kept getting interrupted. There were a lot of people around and a lot of commotion. I finally asked him if he would mind going downstairs to sit and talk. He said that was fine with him. We went through the kitchen and he opened up some of the kitchen cabinets looking for something sweet to eat. He found a couple of chocolate chip cookies and grabbed those on the way down. We went downstairs and there were people down there too. I think Bev and I'm not sure who else. So we were being distracted there too. I kept having difficulty getting other people to leave us along so we could actually have a discussion. I think I went back upstairs once or twice looking for more of my notes or materials. I did convince him to put some clothes on because it was making my parents uncomfortable. It started out that he just flew in for the day and then he was going to fly back out that night. But with all the people and commotion I was concerned that we weren't going to be finished in time. He said that really wasn't a problem at all. He ended up going to spend the night in a hotel I think. I just had this image of opening this hotel room and it was. you could barely open the door, like something was sitting behind it. So I was trying to open the door far enough to somehow push that out of the way so I could open the door all the way. I also remember those doorways were very low and Kendall B was going to have to bend over to come down this hall and get in the door to his hotel room. Something about two of his children.
