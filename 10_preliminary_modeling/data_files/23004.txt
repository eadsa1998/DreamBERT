There was a small restaurant or drive-in, sort of like a McDonald's or Gino's.  The owner was a fairly big, gruff fellow, an acquaintance of mine.  My daughter Christina was with me, and I used her as bait to attract Jane Fonda, who was at the restaurant, not as herself, but playing the part of a pick-up.  We were at tables at an outside patio.  Later, I was sitting in a car with Jane Fonda, who had put a loaded pistol under some newspapers or clothes on the back seat.  I asked her if it wouldn't be better to have it in the glove compartment, where she could get to it more quickly if she needed it.  She said she was afraid it would go off when we went over a bump or something.  Just then a little Japanese guy with a gun came sneaking around the front of the car to her side (the passenger side) to mine.  He was going to kill us for some reason.  The door on my side was open, and when he came around it to shoot us, I got the gun off the back seat and fired it behind my back, behind the seat, through the open front door, and killed him instantly.  He hadn't even fired his gun yet, so at first I tried to make his finger pull the trigger of his gun, so that I could claim self-defense more convincingly.  When I couldn't do it right away, however, I decided it would be too obvious, with the length of time between the two shots.  The restaurant owner had seen the whole thing, and I felt I could count on him to support me, though I wasn't absolutely sure.
