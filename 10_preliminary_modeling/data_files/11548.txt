I was flying a small single-motored airplane called a piper cub with my close boyfriend, John. We were high in the skies, in fact we were above the clouds. All of a sudden the engine sputtered and I realized that we were out of gas. We lost altitude fast and as we neared the ground, one of our wings struck a high-growing tree. In a moment I realized the results of the crash. Our plane was a complete mess and furthermore John was dead. I heard another plane flying overhead and somehow began signaling with smoke signals. This strange plane began to come down but saw that we were in a narrow valley so he decided to pull out. He didn't quite make it because I heard his landing gear hit the side of the opposite mountain. I woke.
