We were at this Great Explorations exhibit or some kind of fair thing, but it was inside. And there were all these various things, and there was an area that said "Teachers," but it should have been "Singers," because they had a Sha_____ display, they had a A______ display, they had a Celine Dion display and they had a bunch of other displays, and there were a few rides and a few little movie things going on. And I was there with Mom. Before they showed the exhibit -- I can't remember what it looked like, though -- and we saw the Celine Dion exhibit -- well, actually the Shaday exhibit was kind of elegant, kind of nice. The Celine Dion exhibit was kind of blah. It was set up on a table and it was a board, this round wooden board, and there was this real cheap, short, stout ch____ plastic figure of her holding a guitar. And there was this magnet and this magnet would move her around the board as the song _______ would play on this blah thing that was there. There was a whole other room that we hadn't gotten to yet, but there was this red door that said, "Teacher's Exit" and I had the notion that when you go out it, it would make an alarm sound. So we, ______ like in a kitchen thing. Oh, I know, all of a sudden I had my CD writer there, and I am recording something, the machine freezes like it did for me yesterday. It keeps getting hotter and hotter and hotter, then I realize that we started a fire. So we were running around now in the house, so we're running around and we don't know what to do, but the porch is like really long. Remember the teacher's exit, I tell Mom, "Open the door and run out," but she doesn't. We just run out the back door to avoid all that, and I think she gets it under control before it really turns into anything major. And then I woke up.
