Betrayal. I can't believe it when I find out that Becca and Andy [my ex] are going out. I see them at one of our parties and I want to just hit them - beat the shit out of them. No one else can really believe it either but of course it doesn't affect them as much. Secretly, I feel they are good for each other. Becca is a smart girl and could face Andys constant overanalysis and philosophizing. She would also probably enjoy sex with him. But still, I hate them. I leave the party. Next morning going to breakfast, they are there again and I try to be OK but eventually I have to leave - making some snide comments on the way out. I hate myself for not having control but then I also think "fuck it". I am saying "I just dont care" but it's obvious I do. I go outside (of the hotel we are at) and leave everyone at breakfast. Andy follows me and I finally breakdown to him. If only he had told me before - I would've have been prepared. I keep walking away with my suitcase in hand - sauntering. <br/
