I was at a shop. I got lost and ended up at one end of the store and there were two little shops next to each other. One was a fortune teller and the other was a blood place (donate, get tested for stuff). I got in this other line, not knowing what it was for. This guy turned around and he said "this is for a Matiz" and I said "What if I was looking at a Matiz". I was going to go to the blood place to check it out, but I decided not to and went to the fortune teller. I asked what she did. The readings were expensive - $60. She told me what each option did and then she said "if you show me the money" and I said I didn't have any money and I was just wondering. She didn't explain properly anyway so I left. I was on MSN later and she was talking to me and had a font, which was a nice purple colour.
