I was riding sitting in the trunk of a car between two other guys.  Our feet were dangling behind the car, sometimes sliding on the pavement.  I was a little nervous, afraid we might hit a bump or something and fall out.  The car was driving in town, and we were only going a short distance, but it turned out to be a little farther than I thought, and the car sometimes drove faster than I expected.  When we finally got where we were going, a man whose car was parallel parked on the street shot someone in front of us and got into his car.  I was really shocked; I hadn't seen anyone shot before.  As the guy was getting out of his parking place, I tried to memorize his license plate, but not to look too conspicuous doing it.  It was a long number-a combination of 8-10 numbers and letters, not sure what state.  I felt I couldn't remember the whole thing, so I tried to remember the first four and the last two or three.  John Forster was there, and he was also trying to see and remember the number.  He wasn't as inconspicuous, though, and the guy got mad at him for doing it.  John tried to tell them that I did it first and gave him the idea.  I was afraid that the guy was going to come after me.
