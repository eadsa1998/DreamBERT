In this dream again I was hearing music and it was by the Beatles. I was with someone else, but no one I knew except just as a passing acquaintance, and he made the remark I got tired of hearing nothing but Beatles on VQAM, so I switched to this station and I reply with a remark that Beatles drive me crazy after a while. But this station plays only one or three every hour so it's not so bad and he nodded and agreed with me. It seemed that we were walking, not in the open spaces, but as we were saying this we were just within a confined area of a building or a house or room. The music was coming from a radio that was just situated in the room. I can't remember exactly where it was positioned.
