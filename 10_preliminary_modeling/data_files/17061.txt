I rode my bike up a steep, narrow driveway to a house that was not my own. I think it was maybe a few houses down from my parents' house. My bike was a BMX freestyle bike. At the top of the steepness, the driveway flattened out and followed along the side of the house. The house was on the right, and to the left of the driveway was a three-foot wall of railroad ties that held back the soil, like a terrace. The yard was a hill that went up to the next-door neighbor's house. The house had unusual architecture like one of the college dorms. Right where the driveway flattened was a trapezoidal arch that formed a telephone booth-shaped gazebo with the railroad ties. There were no cars in the driveway. Suddenly, two women walked around the back of the house and towards the front of the driveway. I ran over to the gazebo corner with my bike. Since I was in their driveway, I didn't want them to see me. I peeked at them through a porthole in the gazebo wall. They didn't see me and walked around the front. I walked back to the driveway, underneath the arch. Then some other guy my age biked up the driveway. He asked me if there was anything cool back there like a ramp or anything. I said, "No," hoping he would leave.
