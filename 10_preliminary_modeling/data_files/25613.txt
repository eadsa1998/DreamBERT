 I'm at a sawmill. My mom is driving a car that I am in, with others. We're pulling a trailer. The road is narrow, and we go over a narrow bridge. We go slowly. At one point I think we're going off the side of the bridge. The bridge is made of plywood and has no railings. We are not in a car anymore. We go through a tunnel. My mom says that the key to the tunnel is to slide, and she demonstrates how. <br/
