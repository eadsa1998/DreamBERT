["Teaching Nancy how to run the disabled students department."] I am working for the Disabled Student Services. It's one of those endless rooms with a corner desk and a couch with acres of floor. I am listening to tapes of student phone calls. From the answering machine. One is angry and complaining, the other is pornographic. I sigh, feeling frustrated. I don't want to have to listen to the pornographic one. A co-worker is asking my help with the boss, Nancy. She is behaving like a dictator and micromanaging. I keep asking Nancy questions to help her see what she is doing. Nancy is upset with me because I am pointing out her faults. I am attempting to help. I am also angry at Nancy for not being more caring with her employees. A male student comes to me as I sit on the couch and says they need a salmon colored marker to make a sign. I look for one in a large clear plastic bag I have. Lots of colors, but not that one. I then give him some quarters and dimes I found on he bottom of the bag to buy one and then give it to me later as it is my personal money I am spending. The co-worker is upset that I have spare change and she doesn't. She isn't paid very much, I guess. She is jealous.
