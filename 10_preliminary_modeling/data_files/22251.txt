I dreamed I had an adventure. I ran away from home and went to the jungle, hitchhiking with some friends, and that we had been hungry and had gone with only water for three days. We had the water in a flask. We continued until we found a tribe of Indians and we had to make a great effort to fight with one of them who had thrown an arrow to one of my friends. I don't remember any more.
