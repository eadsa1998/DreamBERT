I'm in a sort of huge warehouse and I see a movement. I call out. I want to meet that guy that's been in my dreams lately. I walk to where a hall is and see spare doors lined up and I think the guy is behind one of the doors, hiding. I walk in there, feeling scared. What if he's really a hurtful or scary thing? But I keep going because I really want to meet him. I get up on a box and crawl over a few things and then I see him. He's shy and so am I.
