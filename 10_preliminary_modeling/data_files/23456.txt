A two-part dream. First I was with my husband and a high school friend of his. We were in a store looking at clothes. The store was sports oriented and my husband and his friend were "jock" types (even though it wasn't my husband, I knew it was, and yet he wasn't anything like him). The two of them seemed busy looking for something specific and I just kind of walked around following Ken. Then I wanted to try something on but I did it right in the store -- no dressing room. It was then I realized I was pregnant and there were women crowded around like at a department store window watching me. Then I was with my son Charlie. We were on a field trip together. It was outside and my mom was there with us. I was setting up a game on a table. The game was very elaborate and it took me a long time. When I finished, I was talking with my mom and as we looked out, we saw what appeared to be large dark clouds over water but ended up being thousands of black crows diving into water -- the scene was surreal -- dark and turbulent -- with brown muddy hills going up. I saw Bill Cosby there with a bunch of kids, and then started rallying up Charlie√ïs class. I kept watching Charlie interact with his classmates and felt bad for him because he was trying so hard to please and make friends. He didn't seem upset, he just kept talking and laughing with everyone.
