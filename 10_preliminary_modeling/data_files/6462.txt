I dream I'm watching an Australian film named: "The Death That Taught The Citie". Yes, it was spelled that way; "Citie" was "City". I guess that was supposed to be the Australian spelling. Anyway, the movie was about a backwater in the Australian wilderness, about two groups -- an aboriginal tribe and a white tribe. The whole story revolved around this one boy of twelve or thirteen, who had committed some horrible transgression against the (white) tribal law (it was a white boy), and was therefore being made to shoot himself in the face. The aboriginies highly disapproved -- it was 'uncivilized', according to them. They didn't understand the law. And the movie was all about this debate, and all the politics surrounding this punishment: would he be forced to, or not? In the end, it seems, he did kill himself, as custom demanded, but the message of the film was ambiguous. I found the story very interesting, but I guess that's somewhat self-serving, since I directed the film myself.
