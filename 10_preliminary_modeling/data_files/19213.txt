Purchasing or some sort of business transaction that I was involved in, but I can't remember where it was or who it was with or what was being transacted or anything. I don't remember anything about the transaction or the scene I saw. There may not have been anything beyond that. I was driving out of a place that was apparently an Air Force base. I would assume that it was Whiteman, I mean Homestead Air Force Base, and I picked up a service man. He was a sergeant that was colored, and he indicated to me that he wanted to go to the Ale House. I could see myself coming through the gate, and he was standing. He had already passed through the gate and was standing not alongside the road like a hitchhiker normally would, but standing right in the very middle of the road, just standing there. I recall his waving his hands over his head to halt me down. He was very pleased that he got the ride. It was dark, really dark, not like early evening, but more like the middle of the night sometime, that dark. And I can remember that the Air Force uniforms were exceptionally brilliant as far as the blue was concerned, even though it was very dark. The blue shown much more brilliantly than it is in actual life. That's it.
