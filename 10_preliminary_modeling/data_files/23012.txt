This was also about Mary Gardinier, but in a different context.  We were in high school, and we were getting to be very close, without ever having expressed our feelings in words.  We had a couple of classes together, and then had one with a girl who might have been my wife Bonita, except that she had dark hair.  We (the dark-haired girl and I) were engaged, and she knew I was becoming interested in Mary.  I sat behind Mary and the other girl sat on my right.  She kept doing things like putting her head on my shoulder, putting her arm around me, etc.-all for Mary's benefit, I was sure.  I was very nervous, and whenever Mary would turn around, I would try to minimize the effect of the girl's affections without alienating the girl.  I really felt trapped on a tightrope.
