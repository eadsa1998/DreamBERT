I was with a big group of people. We had just finished committing some crime and we were running through a store with the cops chasing after us. We got to a dead-end in the building. There was a big glass wall. One of the guys we were with ran head first though the glass, and the entire wall shattered. We ran just outside the building and huddled. Then we reached into some bags we had and took out clothes, which we began changing into. J changed into really cheap, women's clothes;.only a couple of the others changed. We stood there for several minutes, and bystanders walked around us, confused. Finally, the cops and the feds got to where we were. We all frantically, speed-walked away. The feds saw us take off, but they were confused by the fact that we had changed. We ran across the street and through the fairway of a golf course that I used to live near. I had no make-up on, so I grabbed a handful of sand from a sand trap and rubbed it on my face, which looked like powder. Then we ran into my old house, which was connected to the golf course. The feds followed us in. There was a huge dinner gathering going on and everyone welcomed us as we entered. The feds were welcomed too. My family looked at me weird because of the way I was dressed, but didn't say anything. We sat down for dinner and ate this huge gourmet dinner that my dad and a couple of the guests had prepared. At the end, the feds thanked everyone for dinner and left. We all cheered that we got away with it.
