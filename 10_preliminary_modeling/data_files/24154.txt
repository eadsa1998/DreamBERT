I was sitting at work in the nurse's station next to the administrator of the hospital. In the dream there was no one else around, which is impossible in real life. A co-worker that I don't get along with walked by the nurse's station. The administrator saw her and called her over say "Come here for a minute. I need to talk to you." She walked over to her, the administrator, and said "what?" The administrator asked her to do something, which I don't remember, and my co-worker just walked away and said "bitch!" That is when I stood up from my chair and said "Bitch?, she's not the bitch, you are." Then I precede to tell her how I think she's incompetent, lazy, egotistical and totally unfit for the position she has. She then walked over to me and said "Oh, my gosh, I can't believe you turn on me like that. I thought we were friends." This took me by surprise because she and I have never acted like we were friends. Then she walked away. I felt so relieved and excited that I had told her off. I felt really good!
