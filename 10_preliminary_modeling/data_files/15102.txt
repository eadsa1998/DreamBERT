I went to Ikea by myself. It closed at 5pm and I had left at around 4pm or sometime after. It took me ages to find parking, and I was looking over the bays and I didn't like them? It was 4.54pm and I ran to get there but the lady said it was closed. I was like 'damn it' and I text Mom saying 'closed damn it'. I got back to my car. The people parked next to me were close and I had to squeeze in. They came too. I reversed and they reversed too and I had to stop. Then no-one did anything and so I just went. A car was coming and I managed to get out of the way. Then Nana was walking with me to show me how to get out. Then I was at the other side of the carpark. I was talking with Mom too and it was night. There was a concrete block on the road and there was a bit to walk through. There were a bunch of cars and one backed up and faced towards us. I moved behind Mom and he drove past. She yelled at me for not going behind the concrete and I yelled at her and slapped her hand on the back. I walked through the back way and it was covered in hard 'wire'. Mom said someone was Jewish and I said "is that a dance move?". I was then back in the car and the police were next to my window. Mom drove out. I had two trays to drop off.
