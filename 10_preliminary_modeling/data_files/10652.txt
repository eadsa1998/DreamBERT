I had three brothers and sisters and we were all blond. This lady (I think our Mom) took us to her house to live and she had a mansion that we loved. We were all happy there and playing in the swimming pool. A friend from kindergarten lived around the corner and we talked. Her house got tee-peed and her dad was picking up all the toilet paper. He was pissed. We all went to the shopping center. It was so dream-like. All white and sparkly and spacey like heaven. There was nice music playing. We started out on an escalator. It was a huge mall and we walked around forever. A bunch of stores. We went to the bottom floor and stopped in a flower and shell store which our friend Richard Evans worked in and he said we didn't have to pay for anything. It was all so dreamy and happy -- spacey. We loved the mansion. The mom was kind of mean, but nice, and she gave me everything I wanted.
