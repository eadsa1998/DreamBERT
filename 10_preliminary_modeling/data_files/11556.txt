I was downtown at home in a pool hall talking to some friends, Wells, by name. They lived in back of my grandmother's house. I had dinner at Grandma's then went next door to get a ride back downtown. The people who should have been Wells, turned out to be Dreys, Wayne and Jane (more friends). I got my ride down in a cream and brown station wagon, just newly painted. I knew that the Dreys have no station wagon. They were talking of selling the station wagon and getting a new car but were afraid of trade in allowance. The station wagon had been used very hard. Also Truman's new 20% auto tax would hit very hard. Stop at bookstore to get change for some reason not remembered. Jane sees frat pin says, "Frat man now, huh?"
