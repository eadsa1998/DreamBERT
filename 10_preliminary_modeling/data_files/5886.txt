Am in a garden and trying to reach something in a tree. A picnic table bench is under the tree and on top is the step ladder, with the step legs precariously close to edge of bench, whereas thinner legs are in a solid position. I am hesitant about climbing up this ladder. A man is holding the ladder and encouraging me to go ahead. The man is N.Y. Gov. Rockefeller. He calls to two men who were watching us and one steps forward and sits on bench under ladder to support it.
