I left an institution without permission. An attendant saw me, but did not say anything. Later, a boy was helping me carry something across the grounds to another building. There were big spiders around us. When we reached the place, I saw a red building in the distance which I knew to be for female patients. It was like a building that I have seen frequently in previous dreams. I was employed at a modern printing plant. I worked with some women. I went outside and a girl about eight came and hugged me around my neck. I felt a paternal attachment to her, and I wished that she were my daughter. I suddenly remembered my job and I hurried back inside the plant.
