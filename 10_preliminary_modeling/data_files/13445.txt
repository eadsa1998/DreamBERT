Calvin was talking to Eugene and I was annoyed because I wanted to talk to Eugene. Then some stuff happened and we were in a train tunnel thing. I was in a train along with some others and we were trying to kill someone outside the train. There was a place with water. They were going to hide in it but decided against it. Later I was at home out the back. Eugene had adopted this kitten and called it Clifford. Sometimes Eugene was Hal Sparks. I said "Clifford? Like that big red thing?" and then said it was a stupid name. I was looking at some papers from years ago. I found one that said I was going to adopt this girl called Cleffa as a school project thing. The back door was twisted later and I got Dad to fix it.
