 I'm with my aunt Mary Redding, her family, my mom, and my sister Ramona. We're ordering pizza from Pizza Hut or Dominos. We're getting three large pizzas. Ramona orders cheese bread without lettuce form Subway. It is 3:30. I'm going to a Minnesota Twins game, which is nearby, that starts at 4:00. My friend Norman Noman is there. He might go to the game later.
