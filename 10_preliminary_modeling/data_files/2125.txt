Theresa is in my living room. She's kind of moved in with her kids. Someone drives an old beat up car to the curb and Theresa laughs and calls it "Old Paint." I am in wonder and thankful for her sense of humor. Then I see her kids have painted colorful marks all over my white walls. I am tired and realize I'll have to paint over the walls again. Those kids are like "wild Indians." Then Theresa says, "It's time to do the by-laws." I say, "OK, let's go back to the office." As I start to follow Theresa, a little baby girl gets cranky. She hangs on to me thinking I'm going to desert her again. I sooth her and say, "See, here's a comfy bed and some toys and I am here with you." It's a girl's bedroom. I then see another bedroom and I say, "I'll be right back." I go in there and look around. I am amazed that there is an entire, complete kitchen in this spacious nice bedroom. I say to Grandma Mildred, "You should see Aunt Esther's room with a complete kitchen." I compliment Aunt Esther. Then I remember the baby and I see Dovre at about 12 years old in the bathtub and I ask her to look in on the baby girl. I see she's OK and I ask Dovre to babysit her.
