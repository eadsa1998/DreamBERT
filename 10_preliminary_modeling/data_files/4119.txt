I am a character from a Georgette Heyer Novel. I am from a noble family, but my father had disgraced himself and society doesn't approve of me. I am independent, and have lived most of my life on the country estate, but am intelligent and well educated. I now have apartments in town. I attend musical concerts and socials. I am in the living room of my apartment. My maid falls and breaks a leg. I pick her up and struggle down the street, asking people passing by to help. They seem too busy or unwilling or ignore me. A group of gentlemen see my situation. One man is rakishly attracted to me and offers to help, with intent to flirt and try to have an affair with me. I accept his help, but I do not fall for the rest. Now he becomes genuinely attracted to me and respects me. He courts me. I allow him to, but keep my reserve and slight distance. My love feelings are not engaged.
