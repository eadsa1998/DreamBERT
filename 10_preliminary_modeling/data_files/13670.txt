I was watching the TV from the family room. Dad was in the dining room. They had something about Knocked Up and they were talking to Katherine Heigl, then they had Michael Cera on there. They had something about Juno and Ellen Page and Michael Cera. They didn't know who the father of the baby was. There was an interview with Rik Mayall, Adrian Edmondson and Christopher Ryan but it wasn't him.
