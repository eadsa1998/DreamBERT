A few moments ago I awoke from an awful dream, which seemed more like a nightmare, and that's why I am typing it because my hands were still shaking. I dreamt that I was a lawyer and I had just finished a trial in which my defendant had been given the death penalty, and I went home, very worried, to think. However, I just then got a phone call in which I was told that I was urgently needed in court because my defendant was going to make his last request and I had to be present. I changed in a hurry and I was in such a hurry that I forgot to put on my shoes, which is very strange because I usually put my shoes on first. Then I saw I was in court already and the judge made the following question to my client: "What is your last wish?" and immediately he said that his last wish was that his lawyer should die, and then something incredible happened. The judges agreed to the man's petition and they took me to a very dark cell, which was very cold. After a while they took me out of there and led me to the guillotine and I saw how a sharp axe cut my head and I felt a terrible anguish. And I awoke immediately, and after praying to calm myself down, I started to write this, still a bit nervous.
