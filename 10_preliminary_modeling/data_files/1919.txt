I'm on a tour bus. Co-worker Juliet is there. We went to Italy. I'm in a line. There is a ladder and I go up to the top of it and look down. As soon as I do, I feel unsure of my balance. The ladder topples and I fall down. Then some people come up to me to tell me that this quad back in the line is actually Mark Schoof, a senator's son. I look down on them for "name- dropping" but kind of wished I'd known that before.
