I was at Northtown. There were three video shops. I went down there with Mom one night and now there was only one. It was the smallest one and had been moved a while back "from Miss Maud's". There were posters of DVD's and I said they were all "killer clown movies". Mom returned some movies for me. I was watching Buffy. Buffy was a vampire or someone else, I can't really remember. They were good though and were remembering back to their past.
