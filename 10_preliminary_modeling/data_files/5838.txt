[1974 or 1975] We were living in Hartford, and I dreamed that somehow I got shot in the arm. When I woke up, it took about 20 minutes to get over it, it seemed so real to me. I remember my left arm hurting and the hole that the bullet made in my left arm, on the side, near the shoulder. I woke up and my wife had to tell me over and over that it didn't happen and I could still feel the pain and the hole in my arm.
