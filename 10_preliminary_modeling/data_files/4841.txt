["Varnishing the painting."] I am in a one room apartment. I want to finish up some projects that have been laying around the place for a long time. I see a painting of a man's face. I dip it in varnish, not only the frame, but the entire painting. Then I hold it upside down to let the excess varnish drip off. It feels good to finish a project. I try and sit in the one chair, a modern looking reclining chair. But there are plants draped all around it from hanging plants above it. I pull away some chunks of dead plants to make room for me. I sit there looking at the completely cleared off counters along the wall. I haven't seen it cleared off in years. Now the door flies open. A young girl comes in and three dogs with her. More dogs are in the hall outside. I try to talk her into leaving again, and taking her dogs with her. But she sees my kittens and wants to play with them. I step out into the hall and see lots of people. Ginny and I are going to drive away down the hall in a car, but it is crowded.
