Calvin had been playing my random old songs to people and they were singing them. Some people had them now on their iPods. Isabel was there. I was at a university or something and Eugene, Jeremiah, Darius and Alejandro were all in the class. I'm not sure what it was. I had to collect eye things and find somewhere to set up. The class was then smaller and Autumn was there. Jeremiah said he got into some university and was going to leave to go there before school finished.
