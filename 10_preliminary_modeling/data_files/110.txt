As part of a trip to England, I'm visiting Pete Townsend, being taken by a man who'll introduce us; this is prearranged. We knock on the bedroom door [this house is kinda long and rangy, certainly not very English, I think it's on some water] and he answers - still asleep, really, very groggy, goes back in. I go to a forward room and look around, and then he comes out waked up and we visit. He's been to my place at home, earlier, when I wasn't there. I tell him about [gardens? "gardits"? can't read, don't remember] - he'd talked to an older man there, I don't know him. We go around to another room [a living room, I think, with a view] - his wife comes in, we're introduced - I ask her if she went to the Renaissance Faire that they had in London, and she says yes, she quite liked it. I'm glad.
