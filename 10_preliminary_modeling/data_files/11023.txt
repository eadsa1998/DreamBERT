This dream was quite confused and uncorrelated. I remember, in one part, doing a dance in a pair of black velvet leotards (shoes). I don't know where I was dancing or why. Then I recall talking to a boy, BF, age 20, with whom I went to high school. I never really knew him--only enough perhaps to say hello, but in the dream, we were having a long serious conversation. He asked me to go out with him and I remember not knowing what to do, whether to go with him or not. Two of my girlfriends from high school, EL and DG, advised me not to go with him. I thought the only reason Ellen had said not to was because she cared for him a great deal and was hoping that he would ask her out.
