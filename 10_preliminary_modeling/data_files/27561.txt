I was with a large gathering of people my own age, most of whom I did not know. (Both sexes were present.) One of the boys was injured in some way. It was a boy (age 22) I had recognized as having been stationed at Ft. while I was there. I only knew him by sight. To my knowledge I was the only graduate nurse in the group so I did what I could to determine the nature of his injury &amp; make him comfortable. However, there was a student nurse present who pushed forward &amp; "took over the show." I, more or less submitted &amp; stood by the sidelines. The ambulance &amp; doctor arrived - &amp; transported the boy to the hospital on a plank. The only symptom he seemed to have was a swelling, redness, tautness of the 3rd finger on his left hand. It was believed that he had a spinal injury.
