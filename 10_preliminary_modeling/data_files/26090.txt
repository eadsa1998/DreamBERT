 I'm at the Uptown mall in the parking lot. My ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas, friend Nicole Peterson, and a man named Sam or Hal is there, who may be Nicole's boyfriend. My mom is there. They have come to pick someone up who is with us now. We drive away. I drive my mom's station wagon. My truck is there. I have the keys with me. I think Annie will not be able to drive it because I have the keys. I drive, and others follow me in their vehicles. I turn left near where the Stevens' used to live, and may go by Dan Hellman's house. I'm on the service road along the railroad tracks by Dan's house. I'm wearing shiny black dress shoes and a nice shirt. I'm on the ground sliding on some device. I move by kicking my feet, scraping my way along the ground. I scuff the toes of my shiny black shoes as I move. I get near Brownie Bruny's house. I think that I don't want to look like a dork crawling on the ground, so I get up and walk. Mr. Bruny is in the driveway with another person. He tries to give me a shiny black pair of shoes. I tell him I already have a pair, pointing to my feet. He is very persistent in trying to give me the shoes, and may offer me a shirt as well. I keep walking. I go by a house with a big chandelier in its front window. That house seems to have a square feeling.
