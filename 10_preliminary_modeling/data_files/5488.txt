Last night I dreamed that I received a Braille letter from the agency that I was applying for a job with, and it said that I had been refused the job in favor of a guy named George C... I didn't know the name, because he was involved with some local political activity and other things that I knew about. I said "well that's good, he should be more suited for the job than I am" so I was glad that he got the job and not me. I was also really relieved because I really didn't want the job even though I had applied for it.
