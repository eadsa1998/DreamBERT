I was at a shop with a friend of mine. We were mucking around and following these two guys. I was shopping and I went to the chocolate section. They were saying the names of songs, including Counting the Beat and Starting Over. I went to the checkout and the lady put some paper in the bag and I said it was my dream. She looked at me weird. We had a movie ticket to see A Good Heart, which was a movie, but the song was playing too. When I left, the lady was on the phone and I expected it was with the police, because she thought I was shifty. I went to this other shop. I had salty fingers and I wheeled Poppers in. Nana was saying that Poppa fought like a dog and that he had learned from Fido.
