I counted out my wash: 4 pillowslips, 2 sheets, 2 dresses, 2 handkerchiefs, 12 wash clothes and stuffed them all into one of the navy-blue pillowslips. Some one was using the machine so I put my wash in a corner and went to the dining room to ask for water. The waitress took a sip from my glass of tomato juice and took it away to get another glass. When could I wash? How could my clothes dry today since it was already quite late Saturday afternoon and Miss W. won't permit clothes hanging on the line on Sunday.
