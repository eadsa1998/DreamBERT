I was on the trampoline with about seven or eight other kids that were preschoolers or maybe kindergarteners, I don't know for sure, but I think they were preschoolers. And we had the "Wee Sing" tape playing, and we were playing all the singing games and the circle games. And we were having so much fun, and there was no fear, no anxiety. Whenever I've dreamed about that tape in the past, there's always been something. And this time it was just so different. It was really, really nice. And I had Mom's little hand-held flat tape machine that sounded so terrible. It was on the bunny cage, just like she would put it, and when we were all done with that, we were like, "Okay, that was over." And I flipped the tape over and there was some kind of country yodeling or something on the other side. And then all of us were kind of jumping on the trampoline, and the next thing I knew, I was like jumping on a bed or a couch. I think I was jumping on a couch, and I realized there was somebody sleeping there and I didn't want to wake them up. And then I woke up.
