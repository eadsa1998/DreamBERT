Am in France and going someplace with George Mohr. We approach two curved lines of yellow taxis. One contains normal sized cabs; the others are mostly small station wagon type of delivery cars, typical to the kind used in Paris. George heads toward the smaller cabs and I try to say something to him about using the larger, more comfortable ones. The driver of the first small yellow cab nods as we approach and I decide I don't like his looks. Then George says that we forgot to tell the kids we were leaving and abruptly we turn toward the left to a few buildings like camp recreation buildings. George calls to the young people who can be seen playing in the large building. He calls in English and I then say something in French and immediately they all come out. One small girl runs to me and throws her arms around my legs and clings to me. George continues talking to them in French.
