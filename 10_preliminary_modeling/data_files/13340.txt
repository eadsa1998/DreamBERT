I was watching Sliders. They were in this peaceful, pretty world. Then we were on this beach and there was a building which had been the only sign of humans so far. People came. Some guy wanted to play chess. This girl came. We were at a table and Will Arnett was there as well as others. We were all wearing collars to prevent us from swearing. One guy didn't have one on. Calvin and I were playing this game which matched you up with a person of your preferred sex. Calvin's 'choices' were Madelyn or Liesl. He ended up with Liesl and he wanted to do it again.
