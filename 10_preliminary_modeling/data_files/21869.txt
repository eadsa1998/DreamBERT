I was watching a pop man deliver pop for some kind of game. I noticed a new brand of some kind, but it belonged to the coke company. I was watching Andy K. doing his work. He sure was poky. Judy called to me if the bottles were 5 cents refund and I said, "Let me see the bottles." And she picked up a big bottle. It was about 3 ft. long and about 18 inches in diameter.
