This dream took place in a small room - I don't know where - in which the O.W. Choir (of which I am a member) was congregated. We were rehearsing some popular pieces when a large group of women entered the room. As I remember, almost all of them seemed to be wearing furs. I kept getting up to offer my seat to them, but no one accepted it. The conductor changed the song immediately and we began to sing classical numbers. The women sat along a window sill, and I seemed to keep moving from chair to chair. The director then measured the length of our robes to see that they were three inches from the floor.
