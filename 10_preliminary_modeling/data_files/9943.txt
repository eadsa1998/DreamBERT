At an outdoor party with Frank wearing a white suit. Many people telling jokes and playing games. I go downstairs where they are serving FOOD. A man who also wears a white suit, seeks me out and says: "I have always looked for a woman with Russian eyes." I am pleased to be loved. Earlier was angry at Frank for almost causing a fire when clothes stuffed in a closet started to smolder. Later I climb up high, to a wobbly bookcase, and almost fall down. (awakened)
