 I'm on a plane that is going to take off for Australia. I sit in a small metal chair, like those in the basement of Carter Church. The plane starts to move. I turn my chair to face the front of the plane, and grab on to what seems to be a handrail at the side of the plane. There are no chairs on my left but the other rows in front of and behind me seem to be normal airplane seats. As the plane begins to move, a person or people in back of the plane begin to say the prayer of travelers that I know from my childhood, substituting the plane for the car in the prayer. Others and I repeat the prayer out loud after a leader recites each line. The plane starts to go fast, and then slows. I wonder if something is wrong; something seems to be wrong. The plane turns around and seems to go up a stairs or a ramp. Three men with joysticks are controlling the plane. I see them as the prayer is being recited: "...alertness, good judgment, and quick decision..." I think that these men must be pretty good at controlling the plane. I hope everything goes smoothly. I'm in an airport with a group of people, in Australia. My friend Matt Yams is there. I carry six sheet-like boards of yellow Styrofoam. I float up to the ceiling while holding them, bump my head, and then float back down. It is really fun to float around! I think some people in the group may be annoyed with my antics, so I stop and walk with the group. I talk with Matt. He says he saw a brown trout in a stream that is on our left. There is a young Australian man leading our group through the airport.
