I was lying in bed and a neighbor said I looked so nice in bed. I told her I was relaxing and enjoying it. That's why I looked so good. Grandma came to me and Ann said, "You two should go now if you want to steal the business from someone." We had funny containers for our work. Ann Petrit's had us count her work for her. She also counted with us.
