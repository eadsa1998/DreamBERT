 I'm with my roommate Sean Williams. We're in a dump-like gravel pit area. We see a white car that has Montana license plates, and then has Nebraska plates. Then the car is gone. I know for sure the car was there five seconds before it vanished. We didn't hear it start up or leave. We look and it has not rolled down the hill. I suspect supernatural activity. A flashlight is shined towards us, and a woman calls out. She needs help. She has been shot in the knee. She is with a man, who may have been shot as well. Sean doesn't want to help them. I think that it might be a trap. I run to the side, behind a building. She yells out in a blood-curdling scream, "Damn you! Bastard!" She yells this repeatedly. I am going to help her. By going around the building I want to make sure it is not a trap or a hoax. My classmate from Brimson Jill Banks and I are behind the building. We have to run fast. She says, "We have to make a good show." We're going around the building to see the woman and man's predicament from the other side of the pit. Behind the building a couple feet of snow is on the ground. There area is the dark side of the moon.
