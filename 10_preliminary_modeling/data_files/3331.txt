I am trying to clean up the mess in my rooms, reorganize my things. I find a box of muffin-like cookies and bite into one. It is sinfully delicious, with puffs of chocolate on top. I get sexually excited and want to make love. I yell to someone to send Melville down to me. I go into another room and a woman insists she wants to make love to me and this angers me. She's like Howard in her crass insistence. I push her away. I call again for Melville. I go upstairs to find him and he is an ugly thing with a huge jaw that protrudes out and a part of it falls off his face. This is repulsive and I change my mind. I go back downstairs and move dishes and jewelry around, trying o get things to be where they belong so things are more functional and useful and pleasant to look at.
