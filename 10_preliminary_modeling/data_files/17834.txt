Having trouble remembering parts of the dream.  Water, a dwelling, and some sort of orangey-black orb.  Someone was with me.  There was something special about the house, and we were trying to get inside- I'm not sure if it was to destroy something bad looming inside or that it had some sort of strange rejuvenating powers.  Something seemed magical about it.  There was something uncomfortable about the water, too, and we were trying to be careful not to touch it.  At the end, I remember watching the orb roll down a path around a corner of the building, and as it did so the path sort of sank into the water.  I was afraid the orb would sink, but as it started to go down further, there was some sort of hole that was forcing air or water upwards, so at the end of the small brick-like track, the orb was shot out of the water toward the house.
