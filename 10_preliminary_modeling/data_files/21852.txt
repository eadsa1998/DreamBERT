Carl Fischer and I were walking by an old tree that was on a bank above us. I said, "That tree will fall one of these days." The next day we went by and as I passed it, I commanded the tree to fall. I said, "Fall now," and to my surprise, it started to fall and down it came. I met Bob and some of his friends and I was telling them about the tree, but they were not interested. Ann was sitting by the wall holding our small baby and she said, "I smell gas." I looked down a protruding pipe and I could hear the gas coming out. The cap was removed by someone. Mike Pavlic (deceased) was in our home. We had a big sewer hole for the water to run thru. I looked down and there was a fire in the bottom of the hole.
