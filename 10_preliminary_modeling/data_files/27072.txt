r had taken my Godmother's daughter, who is 17 and like a sister to me, to some sort of a lesson &amp; while waiting for her I thought I would talk with one of the advisors at this building. I believed it to be like a placement service. I went into a room and found a man well dressed who spoke like a physician instead of a placement advisor. He began questioning me about my feelings, I became afraid for he said I would need a series of treatment which would be expensive. I told him the reason I came was that I wanted to find some sort of part time work. He didn't seem to understand, &amp; he told me to take G. home but to come back because I was a sick person. I hurried out, but didn't have any thought of returning. It was raining when we went out side - as we walked along I noticed that this mob was following us. I saw a street car coming so I told G. to on to my house, that I was going to take the street car &amp; go to her house. I felt that I must talk to her mother about what had happened. However when I was on the car I found that this person was there also. I had forgotten to get a transfer so I went back and obtained one. When it was time to change cars I got up quickly &amp; ran for the next car. It seemed as if I got on the car with out being followed this time.
