I was picked up by a group of fellows who I went to high school with while I was waiting for a bus. I had a pair of baseball shoes on. We were talking and the one fellow (about 20) started to say that my old girlfriend was engaged, but stopped when he thought I might be hurt by this news. I told him I knew all about this event. We all climbed out of the car together.
