I am with a group wanting to understand the dreaming. There seems to be an old group and a new group. I join the old group and become terribly nauseous. I remember the vomiting dreaming of the Ngintaka. Also the vomiting dance. When I wake up I see the clouds above me. A gigantic eagle with a wingspan crossing the sky flies overhead. After a few seconds of observation it disappears. Then there is a flash of lightning and it begins to drizzle. I get up to cover our belongings.
