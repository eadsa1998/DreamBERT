I was going out with Eugene and knew Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki. They were both from different comics and Jensen was Batman and Jared was Superman. I was good friends with them but I was interested in Jensen. We eventually had sex. I woke up in his bed. I saw Jared later and he knew what had happened and I was sitting with him and he said that he understood that "you weren't overcome with the urge to screw me" and I was like "yeah..." and took a drink, thinking 'not quite!'. He was angry and didn't pick up on it. I was then climbing along a wall at night. I was trying to get into a friends house. He let me in. We were going to expose something. I was discussing comics with Ezra. He and Mom were sleeping in the same room. I borrowed her phone.
