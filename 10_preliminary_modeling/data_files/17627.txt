I was at work- a combination of working at the observatory and the detox center at night.  I was in my boss's office looking for my timecard or something.  I was alone on duty and was trying to deal with something I hadn't done before.  I searched the office and there was some mechanical thing that looked something like a phonograph.  Someone showed up briefly.  I had to go out for something.  I got in my car and drove to a shopping center several blocks away.  Then I went back to work but had to drive another half mile past and park in a community college lot.
