I am a sort of secretary to Howard and his friend Bob H. Howard tells me that an old Uncle, general, has requested me. I refuse to work for the old guy. I pout. I gather up my memory scrapbook (high school) and run. I am in a school. As soon as I'm out of the room, I turn left and round a corner. I hide in a locker. They run past me, looking for me. I am hugging my scrapbook, hoping I don't get locked in accidentally. Later, I go back into the school room. There are grass clippings on the desk. I clean them up sulkily not looking at Howard or Bob as they try to convince me. Later, it's time to go. I'm told which of Lydia's girls are sitting in the back with me.
