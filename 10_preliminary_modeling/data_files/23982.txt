I was with some of my friends. We were outside the mall. One of my friends, Bob, said that we should go inside the mall and shop. We walked inside the mall. There were a lot of people around. There were bright lights inside the stores. We shopped for about an hour. Then we ran into this kid that goes to our school. He started following us. He is the same age as me. He would not stop. I told my friends that I would meet them by Carl's Jr. in a half-an-hour. I had to go to the bathroom and go into stores they didn't want to go into. The kid was still following me. He would not stop. I started running, to try and find my friends. I couldn't find them. That was when Bob came up to me and hugged me. I told him the kid was following me. He got into a fight with the kid. Bob was okay, and saved me. The police came and took the kid away. During the time that Bob was fighting, I was scared. I was also scared when the kid was following me. I was happy when we were shopping and when Bob saved me.
