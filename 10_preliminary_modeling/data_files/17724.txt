I was in a lecture hall like at the university near my parents' house.  Tina Yothers was there.  I think I was part of a group of friends.  We were taking a difficult test.  Tina got up and read the first half of the difficult question; the second half would be given next class.  Class was then dismissed.  Somehow I ended up in a sexual act with the professor.  I was rather enjoying it, but we weren't able to finish.  Then we were somewhere else.  My boyfriend Jeremy was there, and he'd bought a purple bag of 20 or so condoms.  They were "her pleasure" and something else, somewhat odd.  The bag was handed to me in front of my mother, but I just thought, "oh well".  I wanted to continue the sex with the professor.  Something else went on, but I can't remember.  Later on it was night, in a parking garage.  My car had been tilted onto one side- the other side had flat tires.  The car had been damaged and was there with another for fixing.  I wish I could remember the rest.
