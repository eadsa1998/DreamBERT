I was at a house and it was dark. I was Clark Kent (Smallville, as in Tom Welling). I walked down some hall and there was a person there. It was actually a premonition and I was someone else (I wasn't Clark). Then, Clark was there and he said that he thought someone was here so he carefully walked down the hall, but they left. Mom and Darren were outside. Police came.
