 I'm in my high school at a gathering after a basketball game in the lunchroom. One of the basketball coaches named Vern Peck is there. I tell everyone to play basketball, and start running around simulating a game. There are too many people. The ball is a bottle of vodka. I do a give-n-go and dunk the bottle in a toilet. At first I try and the toilet lid is down, so I lift the lid and then dunk it. The bottle breaks. Vern Peck is mad at me for breaking it, and says I'm going to pay. Con Carson, my old high school basketball coach, tries to intervene but I tell him to stay out of it. I go to get my bag in the locker room but it's blocked and I realize I didn't really play in the game. I get a ride home from Nate Nelling. We walk out of the school, saying hi to Mr. Zates. There is a bunch of Armstrong Students there. I get eight points for my costume.
