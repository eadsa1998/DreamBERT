I was living at the house on Lakeland Dr. I was in CI with some of my CRHP sisters. We were at an event. I had put together a video. At lunchtime we were eating some soup I had made. I had gotten the recipe from a previous CRHP group, from a book or video they had put together. Everyone loved the soup. I said one of the reasons I liked it so much is that it reminded me of summer. It had sliced bananas, kiwis, and other fruits in it. Maybe it was a cold soup. It was very pretty. As we were talking about this soup I realized that I had neglected to give appropriate credit for the recipe in the video and that I would have to edit for that. I went in to the house of the woman who was duplicating the video. I wondered why someone outside of our CRHP group was duplicating it. I realized I was going to have to edit the master video and then the ones that she had already duplicated. I went back to my house for some reason. I was walking. When I got to my street there were large boxes scattered around the street about midway to my house. When I got closer to them I realized they were all for me. I choose one that was nearest to the middle of the street and drug it to the sidewalk and then drug it the rest of the way home along the sidewalk. Once or twice I veered off the sidewalk and then got back on it. When I got to my driveway I noticed rows of grass growing up through the cement driveway. I drug the box up the driveway and just then realized that I left my keys back at CI. I would have to walk all the way back to get my keys. I realized it would take me about 15 minutes. Now there were two of my CRHP sisters there. They were going that way too but they were going to run. I had a plastic tumbler with something to drink in it. I was finishing my drink and telling them to wait for me, that I would run with them. As we began to run I was finishing my drink and telling them that I wouldn't be able to keep up because I'm not a runner, but I was going to try anyway.
