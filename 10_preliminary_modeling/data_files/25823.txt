 We have gone fishing very early in the morning. We quit fishing before it gets light out. This isn't characteristic of me, I think: I'm usually in for the duration of the fishing day. My friend Kevin Simpson throws a snowball at a latrine. He hits the latrine, and the snowball almost goes inside it.
