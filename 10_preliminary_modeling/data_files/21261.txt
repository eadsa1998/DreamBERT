I wanted to see silver in the raw state, so I was let into an old building that was locked under key always. There was a barrel of it. I poured some of it in my hand and it was yellow. I noticed it was small balls, had holes in it and there was a thread inside. I said, "This is not the raw state." I tried to lock the door with the three locks and only one held. A couple of bandits came to the door and demanded the door be opened. So the owner opened and let them in. They wanted the silver, I saw, but the owner gave them the copper and brass and they didn't know the difference. The other door was open on the other side of the building. Charles Charvat and I ran out the door unnoticed. We ran right thru an open field and I thought at any moment we would be shot by the bandits. Then we came to a mist like and felt safer. We wouldn't be seen by the bandits as we got near to let the police know of the robbery. I looked at a piece of silver. I unraveled it and it was a silver wrapper. I said this was not raw silver. I was in a building near by boyhood school.
