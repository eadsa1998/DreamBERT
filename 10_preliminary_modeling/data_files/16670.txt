I was going to a conference of the National Federation of the Blind, and it could have -- you know, when I think about it, it could have been the _____ or it could have been a theater organ conference. I really don't know for sure. ______________ and apparently I had to leave from Eastport and fly to Charleston and then I made a connection in Charleston and then I would come back home, back to Southport, I think, because it was in the southern part of the state. And I would rather do all that flying rather than ride in a car all that way. But _______________ I didn't know what city it was going to be in. [laugh] And as it turned out, it was going to be in Honolulu, Hawaii, and so it was easy, yeah, the city was going to be Honolulu, Hawaii, but I had a feeling like the location was really down south, because I was in a taxi and we could drive there. And the taxi driver started going south and going and going, and I sort of didn't think I was going to go all the way with him, and he really didn't want to go all the way, because he said, "Oh, that bridge, oh, my God!" But I was using the time to make some phone calls to figure out what the heck I was going to do, whether I was going to call Mom and Dad and have them come rescue me and say I had screwed up or whether I was going to call the people regarding the NSB or somebody was already going to be at the door _______. I don't know exactly how I solved this, but I think they gave me the name of somebody who was already going that way. And next thing I know, I was at the conference. And I don't know how or why this fed into it, but the city name of Honolulu reminded me of Lalalu, and I was hearing the version of Lalalu that was a duet between a man and a woman. And that was kind of weird. So I got the house. This conference was actually at a house, and this is what makes me think it was a theater organ thing, because there was a great, nice, nice piano and there were two organs, and they were electronic organs, but they had this little pedal board like mine has. And they were decent, they weren't old analog, you know; they weren't the funny ones. And this lady was there and we were sitting at the piano and we were getting ready to do a duet, and _______ -- bless his soul -- was being so rude. He was butting in and waving his own music, and talking over us and just really, I don't know, just being rude. And then the conference was starting, and someone was starting to speak and _____ King didn't want to sit down and be quiet. So the lady who was doing the piano duet with me and two other people kind of like herded him and escorted him into another room. And then I woke up.
