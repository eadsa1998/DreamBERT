I was waiting for a train. My mother and sister were there. We had visited my mother's sister who is a nun. She worked in the hospital where we visited her. I had to buy something at a ticket office costing $100, then I tried to buy a ticket. There was a time deadline for the purchase of the ticket and we were past the time, so the agent would not sell me one. I recognized the agent as a man I once knew named Wm. Doran. I pleaded with him, but he would not give in. I told him we would miss our train. Then he left, and my mother persuaded another man to let me buy a ticket.
