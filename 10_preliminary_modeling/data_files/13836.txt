I had been watching something and it mentioned a movie called "Two Guys in a Bed" and that they were in a bed for the whole movie. I looked it up and it said Justin Timberlake and Will Arnett were in it. It was also made in 1997. I downloaded it and I was watching it and it wasn't bad. Then Justin Timberlake was actually this latin-y looking guy and he was in highschool. He was playing basketball in a gym and this guy asked him if he had "slept with an older guy" and he said yes. Clea Duvall was also in it.
