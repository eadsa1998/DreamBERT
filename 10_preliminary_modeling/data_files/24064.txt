I'm in my brother's room and Dan is doing the shading on my back tattoo and he's doing it in red. And even though I don't want it in red, I apparently don't really care. We finish and I look at it in the mirror, and it doesn't look very good at all. It's really, really dark in some areas and then some areas aren't even shaded at all. Dan looks at me and says, "Don't worry, in a couple of days it will blend together and look good, AND we're not done yet because I'm not sure how I'm going to shade the rest. We then walk over to my brother's closet and there is a piece of skin hanging on a hanger with a back tattoo of a weird robot on it, and Dan says, "What do you think of this? We should shade yours like this one." I wake up.
