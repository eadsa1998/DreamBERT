Granny was still at the hospital which was different. Someone asked me where Virginia was and I said "I don't even know where we are now! Woodside?". I was right. I left with Mom and we got stuck on the road and then left there. I saw smoke behind us and there was a thing in the sky hanging off a crane or something. T here was a fire and this guy was in the crane thing with a hose. He fell off into a bush. Later I was at the hospital again and these gangster drug dealing brothers came and they were like Hispanic. They all ended up shooting each other, except for one, who left in a car with the money. I asked this lady for a lift and she looked scared and said no. I was with Ezra and Roland by the way. Then Mom came and we all got in.
