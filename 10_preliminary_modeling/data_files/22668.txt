My exams had ended, and I was worried about the results because I was not sure I had answered well. When I was talking to some friends, a professor arrived and told me that I was doing well in all the other courses except in the one she taught. I said, "But, Miss, how is that possible? I knew it well." And she answered that she didn't believe so. When I awoke, I realized that it had only been a bad dream, but anyway, I was worried.
