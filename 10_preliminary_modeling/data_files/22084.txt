We were walking down a very pretty street with some friends whom I perceived very vaguely. We arrived at a group of buildings where there was a lot of movement going on, apparently due to rumors of a war. We tried to get out, but couldn't (the buildings were surrounded by gardens). Suddenly my uncle Julius appeared, but he did not solve the matter. One could see that the other side was preparing itself for the fight, and suddenly they appeared. I don't remember any more, even though I believe that we started to run away.
