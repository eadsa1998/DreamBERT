I was acting through the persona of a member of a primitive tribe who had become engaged in some type of struggle. One of the struggles was to reclaim this boy Stephen which he surmised was the son of his daughter. There was a lot of anthropological and class study proceeding throughout the dream. At one point, my persona, which at this point had changed to someone else, had to engage in this very strange scavenger hunt to defend the family, picking up toy cars and finding notes on them. We found clues under the bed, being directed to follow the yellow brick road, all while being watched by the evil villain who had forced me out through his airlock. What other details? The boy was found by being seen in a photograph by his glasses. There were one female voice that tried to keep me from leaving the airlock of the ship but I ignored her.
