I was skiing down a large hill with a companion I did not recognize. Near the bottom was a jump which I went over. There was a crowd of people there and they all applauded. I took off my skis and went into an old barn which was nearby. I climbed an old ladder into the loft. There I found a broken iron rabbit such as is used at the dog tracks (during the race it stays just in front of the dogs). Holding it, I jumped from the loft. The ladder had fallen.
