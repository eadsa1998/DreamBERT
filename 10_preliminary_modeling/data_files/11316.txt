The dream took place in my own home. It seemed that a strange man was living in our home. I do not know the identity of this man, nor does he resemble anyone with whom I am acquainted. However, the strange man was apparently mixed up in some type of questionable business. Whenever I tried to question him he gave me evasive answers about himself. Finally this man said that he was going to take over our home and our family must comply with his wishes. At this point my father entered the house and drove the strange man out by force.
