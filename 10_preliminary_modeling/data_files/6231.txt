Two nights ago I dreamed that my 14-year-old dog, a Cocker Spaniel was hit by a car and killed. It was actually more of a nightmare than a dream. The driver left her in the middle of the road for dead. Although this probably couldn't happen because I always keep her on a leash, it was very realistic nonetheless. Thank goodness my dog was fine. She was sleeping peacefully in her bed. I did not get back to sleep for about two or three hours after that nightmare.
