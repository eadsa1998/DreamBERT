Dream about being in a store -- an AM/PM type place with Candy and Donald and Jim. Looking for whisky? I was discussing what kind of beer to get with Jim. I asked him to tell me what kind of cheap beer they wanted. I saw a penguin with champagne on it. It came in different sizes and was for weddings. I wanted to get a small one for Candy. But I couldn't decide. I didn't have enough money. Also it might be tacky. Jim was saying it was just a toy. But I thought it could be special.
