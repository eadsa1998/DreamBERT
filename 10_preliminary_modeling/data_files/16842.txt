This was the first of a series of dreams that I had on this night that don't relate to each other - rather like switching tv channels. I was living in what seemed like an old school building - Victorian perhaps. My brother and I found a flying machine together with instructions. It was a small balloon or airship - very small, so that the balloon part (which was elongated, or perhaps grape-shaped) was about the size of a small car. Attached to it was a box or basket for two passengers and some controls. We took it to a garden within the grounds of this building,d or perhaps a near-by park to try it out. There were no other people around at all. It worked, and we flew about 10 m off the ground before we got scared and lowered it again.
