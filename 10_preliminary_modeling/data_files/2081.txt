I am preparing to be in a play contest. I struggle backwards through traffic as the crowd is all coming to see the play and I am trying to get around to the stage door. I'm in my wheelchair. I get back there and start talking to the other two actresses. I am nervous and suddenly remember that the play "Juba" isn't today! Thank goodness, because I don't remember my lines on that one, but I'm OK on "Rueben." Then I realize I'm playing two characters, a woman boss and a secretary. I choose two or three hats and try them on. The other actress says, "That one is too big. It will distract." I agree and then start to really get nervous because if I add the bit of switching hats, I'll forget my lines. I say, "Let's run lines," and the other actress says her line, "Don't you have all twelve done?" I respond, "There are three jobs times three," and then I realize those aren't the exact words. 3x3 doesn't equal 12. I really feel panicky now. It's twenty minutes until curtain and I can't remember the lines. My memory has gone blank. I pace, saying, "What will I do,? I can't remember my lines." The other actress eyes me in disgust. I say, "If only I could carry the script book or tape it."
