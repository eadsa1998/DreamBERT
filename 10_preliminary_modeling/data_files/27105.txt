I was bicycling down a long, wide highway. There were many other people on bicycles too. There were many many stoplights--perhaps two within 10 feet of each other. I was striving to reach each of them when the light was green. But every time I would get to one it would turn orange or red and then I wouldn't know whether to go on through and then I would worry about being arrested. (although I sensed the change in color in the stop lights I did not see the colors in the dream)...
