The YMCA had hired the Merit Cigarette Swimming Pool Management Company for lifeguard training. Seems 3 kids were playing something. I ran up there and maybe I said , "??? Life guarding for 2.5 hours and left. Input VI." Cookies were drying out in the sun--where we were going to be. I'd left ??? out at what trash in leave. There was an egg salad sandwich that I'd peeled the top slice of wheat bread from, and the sun had dried it all crusty. I had left my picnic directly on the asphalt of the tennis court and tried to put it in a very flimsy shoebox to carry it (the crusty, now open face egg salad on wheat, and some baked chicken and some sandwich wrapped in plastic and a vanilla bean. A little girl was cold and lost. I gave her the vanilla bean. I helped her get it open. It looked like a brazil nut. ??? 4 as constantly patrolling the area--but the Merit guys were clearly NOT who they appeared to be. There were NO LIFEGUARD. Not sure.
