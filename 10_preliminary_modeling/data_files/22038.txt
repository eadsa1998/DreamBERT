My dream was really a surprise because I never thought it could relate to a person who I secretly hate and dislike. The motive for my resentment is that he offended my closest relative, not just by speaking against him, but also going against his own family. This all stems from an old partnership which he had with my relative, who was a victim of fraud and this is the cause of the resentment. Besides, he is approximately 70 years old. This relates to my dream in the following way: My relative and I were in the same place where my relative used to work (in Ica). His job was related to the sale of carbonated drinks. Suddenly that person appeared with his son -- 35 years old -- and when we saw them, we felt some sort of disgust. Therefore, we decided to get out of that place and we parked by the sidewalk in order to leave later on. That's all. Parenthetically, it must be said that my relative has been called by the carbonated drink concern to take care of the administration of it in Ica. This rectifies the tremendous injustice done to him by the above-mentioned person.
