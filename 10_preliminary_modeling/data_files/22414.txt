My mother told me that I should go to someplace out of the city to learn something (I don't remember what). I went by car to a house in a  far-away place. On the way we passed through a road that went through a valley; the scenery was green. I got to a house that looked like a ranch, where I had to find an older woman. The house was not very nicely kept; it looked like it belonged to people without much money, though not poor. A man of about 21 years, or perhaps 18 or 19, opened the door for me. I was attracted to him. Then I saw myself going back home in another car and I arrived there at night. I believe the car was black.
