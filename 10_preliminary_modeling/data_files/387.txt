I'm in Florida, married, in a house with (family?) - Jack Palance is here, and a woman [his wife?], and we've been mentioning the electricity, it's had to be cut off and restored because of some external problem. I pick up the phone to call MasterCard about my balance, but there's no dial tone. Just about the same time Jack plugs the transformer into the wall, and then a tone comes on. He rigged that to disconnect, too, to save trouble and electricity. Not a bad idea. I call, and find that I can't get the information without calling The city - a man at a bank here tells me he can't get access to that information, I'll have to transfer my account to Florida. I'm very concerned about that - what if I get it transferred? That's so permanent, do I want to do that? What if I change my mind? --------- Later, being outside at the beach, I feel confused but optimistic - here I am married to a nice-looking guy, and in a place where everybody goes to the beach, my being fat doesn't seem to matter so much. I picture myself having a ball playing with people in the water, relaxing in the sun. I wonder what it would be like to want to stay in Florida. I'm in a store, something like a grocery store, and we're closing for the day. Harry Anderson is my boss, but we're quite close. There's some kind of apprehension, like someone's liable to break in and we have to be real careful to lock up. I try a side door that usually isn't opened, and by George it is. I call to Harry to come lock it, and he doesn't come right away, he thinks I'm mistaken, and I have to urge him. I'm quite concerned, keep watching out.
