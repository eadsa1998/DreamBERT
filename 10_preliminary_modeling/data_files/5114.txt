I am running to help, wounded as the gunfire and machine gun fire is all around me. I leap over two brick walls to get to them. I try to fix their wounds. Then I see a cardboard box and realize a baby is in there. I pull off layer after layer of cardboard some with writing on it from the baby's mother, I finally find the baby in a plastic molded container like she was a doll. I take her out and feel immense relief for her. I hold her and kiss her and hug her, knowing she had a very traumatic time in the dark and want her to feel loved and whole. She has short cute blonde hair and wears a blue jammie. She is happy and not badly traumatized by her experience. [BL]
