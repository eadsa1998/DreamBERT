I found myself in the Adelbert Gym practicing golf. I was hitting golf ball after golf ball against the canvas curtains which divide the gym into sections. My girlfriend came into the gym. Though I was surprised to see her (for this was the boys' gym) I asked if she would like some instruction in golf. She replied that she would like to learn the game. I gave her a golf club and showed her how to swing. After she had hit nine or ten balls she said that I had better start practicing myself if I wanted to make the golf team. When I began again a boy came over to me and asked me to hit a lead golf ball. I replied that I would not for it might break the club. Then Eddie came over to me and told me to leave for the baseball players had to practice. I was very disappointed but nevertheless I picked up my clubs and left. I then awoke feeling very sad.
