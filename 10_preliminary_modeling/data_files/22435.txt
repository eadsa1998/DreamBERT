We had gone out for a walk at night. We were: a girlfriend, a little boy and myself. We were walking when suddenly we realized that we were being followed, that two men were the ones following us, and that, furthermore, they were policemen. They were a good distance behind us, so we got away by going through a series of little streets and we passed by several portals or iron gates. And we arrived at my girlfriend's house on the beach, and when we got there, we found her mother playing cards with some of her friends. We asked her if she had seen the policemen and she said that she hadn't, and then we went to hide. I don't remember any more.
