I rode the bus to a store.  The cats were with us.  It was a new store, and there were some cool blue shoes.  They were 8 _ though, and they didn't have anything smaller.  They said to come back later.  In the store itself there was a childcare center next door that was mislabeled.  Then I was playing a game with some people on the patio with sticks and a feather.  In the end it was only me and one other.  Finally we got bored.  My boyfriend Jeremy asked if I wanted to go swimming and he jumped in the pool.  There was a brick missing in the flowerbox in my parents' backyard and water was flowing down.  I told my mother.  Most of my hair was cut above my shoulders.  I bruised my knee.
