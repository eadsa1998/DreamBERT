I was at Granma's. I ordered some free thing over the net to her house. It was Christmas but it was December 5. I kept asking why it was earlier but no-one knew. I went downstairs and there was a package at the door. In it was an old That's Life! I opened it and it was mine from 2002. I showed Granma and then Mom came and she took me to this place and said that the package and been picked up and the right one was dropped off. Wherever we were, there were two animals that were dead. I was standing close to one but I moved back because I thought it would get up, and it did. It hopped into the bushes. Some people from Monty Python were there. Mom pretended to drive off, but she accidentally did and I had to quickly jump into the car.
