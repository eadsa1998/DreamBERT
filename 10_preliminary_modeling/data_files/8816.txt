I was at my computer getting ready to send an e-mail to Bill C. I. wanted to verify that he did in fact, want me to show up for work this coming week, Monday through Wednesday. I knew it was my last week but for some reason I wasn't sure that he actually wanted me to come into the office. Just as I was getting ready to write the e-mail Matthew walked up, and so I stopped. I wanted privacy writing this e-mail. I'm not sure what Matthew wanted. He looked at me funny, like he was wondering why I stopped what I was doing. I told him I was getting ready to write this e-mail and I really would rather do it in private. He walked away, and I was getting ready to start again, and Ashley B walked up. Again, I didn't want to send the e-mail or write the e-mail with anyone around. There is a table to my right and slightly behind me and there was a big platter of fried chicken on it. I told Matthew it looked really good and that I would love to have the drumstick.
