My husband and I have bought a new house (my husband in this dream is a total stranger). We are living in the downstairs quarters when I notice that a strange, older man keeps popping up. He seems to be the previous owner. I feel we are being persecuted and we go upstairs to confront the ex-owner. Upstairs is empty but fully furnished. We feel we have bought this house and can live upstairs. We start to discover the different bedrooms. At one point the older man comes in and starts to terrorize me. My husband has gone to get some form of defense. He comes back with a club or bludgeon. Meanwhile, this old guy is trying to strangle me and I yell at my husband to go get one of his many guns -- "That's what they're for! I'm angry!" While he goes off, I begin to get sexually aroused by the physical mess of the struggle. I tell the older guy I'm getting excited and he begins to ravish me. He has a long penis. Other people join in, men and women. I am getting the screw of my life. My husband comes back in and is angry. The others all disappear. I am still very turned on and want my husband to fuck me. He does so, angrily, when next I notice my 12-year old son come in (he's a deck level above us) and he excuses himself for interrupting but didn't know we were "doing it." I get up to go answer the door and find an attractive woman looking for the previous owner. We are immediately attracted to one another and push towards a room where we can have sex. After which she comes up and meets my husband and son. She says my husband is a hunk and quite handsome. She remarks that usually sex goes out the window once you're married. I feel this is so true. When she meets my son, she gives me a smile and "slaps me a 5" in the old way -- down low -- saying my son is equally good looking. I turn around and notice the old man is walking away -- down the stairs into the street -- with a young boy of about five. I realize they are both ghosts. I was being haunted.
