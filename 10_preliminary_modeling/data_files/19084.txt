In the dream it was the very last day of the semester of school, and for some reason my girlfriend and I had to buy her father perhaps a watchband, but it had something to do with glasses. Some accessory to glasses, I mean some accessory to drinking glasses. Something like a watchband is to a watch, this was to glasses, that he really needed. We wanted to buy it because the next day would be the last day of school. So we went to a little shop I remember. There was a little Jewish woman proprietor and she said that the next day they wouldn't be open until 12 o'clock, what does she have to kill herself for, and so on and so forth. So we looked at the stock that they had and I didn't like it too much. So I said to my girlfriend, "Let's go. "We'll look at another place before making a decision."
