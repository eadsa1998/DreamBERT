I was near the beach with Dad. A guy came up and asked me to be in the next Charlie's Angels movie and then the three actresses came out of a caravan, so I said ok. I was in the car with the three angels, but then Lucy Liu left. I went to the shop with Drew Barrymore and I was looking for a pocket knife, but I couldn't find one. As the shop was about to close, some old man found them.
