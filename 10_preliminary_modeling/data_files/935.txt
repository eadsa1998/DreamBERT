Snatches of the other dream. Sandy C, hypnosis. Someone put a yellow tattoo color on my ear. I was angry that they would use me so badly without my permission. I said, "If I wanted a tattoo, I'd get a little butterfly on my left shoulder but not a big yellow one on my ear." The man just used me to see if the color would work. I was angry.
