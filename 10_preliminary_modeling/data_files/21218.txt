I was sleeping on a bed. John Tesar came in and crawled in with me. I girl came in and I said, "You have a nice face." She just smiled. I went on the porch and that's where I said I slept on the hard floor without a pillow. A man gave me his coat. It was leather on both sides. He said it was mammal skin. All at once I see captured elephants being led. Steve (brother) and I ran up and scrambled up a hill. It was a small peak about 200 ft. in diameter and there was a drop of about 20 ft. This is what, we were safe from the elephants. I got up and heard the elephants coming around. I got up just in time. I was in Africa. I was on a different hill. I saw wild beasts roaming the jungle. I saw a lion coming our way. I pointed at him as though I was going to shoot at him, but I had no gun. He kept on coming closer, so I ran off the ridge to the other ridge to find a hiding place from the wild animals. The whole gang came after me and the lion followed. I knew he would find us, so I thought of getting away. I sort of jumped over some horses and started to fly away. I flew by people who were riding on horseback. It was the way of travel there. I was flying downhill and I had to sort of hold my flying back so I wouldn't go too fast. I saw a man lying on the ground. He was wounded or something. A girl came up with a pair of shears and cut off a lock of his golden hair, and another girl came and took off more hair. The man who was administering to the fallen man saw this, so he took the shears and cut the rest of the hair off and put them near and the girl and she picked them up and held them in her hands. These two hills seemed to be rocky. I saw it in the paper or it came to me in my sleep, what a nurse.
