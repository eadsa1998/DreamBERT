I was doing temp work for the company that John B and Gary S worked for. I didn't realize it until I saw John B. I had a few conversations with him. He told me that Gary  S was going to be in town in a few months. I mentioned to him that I was going to try to lose twenty pounds before then. He shook his head no, as if he didn't believe that I could. A couple of months later he and Gary S showed up and I had lost the weight. John B was shocked that I had been successful. Gary S was quite taken with how good I looked. I knew we were going to have some private time together later and I was so excited. I could hardly wait. The work that I was doing there was initially manual labor. I was using an electric sander to smooth the edges of sawhorses.
