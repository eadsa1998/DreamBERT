We were moving. There were a bunch of things that we had to figure out what to do with temporarily, about dividing it up. It seems like it was food from the freezer or refrigerator. A number of people came up with suggestions that kept getting voted down. I finally made a suggestion that the man keep all of the non-flowering houseplants and I would keep all of the flowering ones, since they were my favorites, and then we could just keep them permanently. He liked this idea and agreed to proceed accordingly.
