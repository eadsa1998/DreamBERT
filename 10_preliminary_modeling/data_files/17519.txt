We were looking around in the house.  It was my housemate Drake's birthday.  I was auditioning or something for Grease, but impromptu.  We'd create the lines and officiate it a few minutes later.  I ordered something from the food joint.  I walked down the street.  Drake gave my mother and me kites.
