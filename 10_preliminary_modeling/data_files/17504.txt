Dreamt about the conference in the online agnostic debate club.  It was also sort of like from the city club.  It was sort of a mirror image of the house, and I was in my housemate Gina's room with some others.  I remember meeting Grayman.  We gathered together and went to the meeting.  I went to go meet someone else, another girl, so I floated off to meet her.  But she touched something, a light (literally) rail.  That got her permanently banned.  I didn't want to give up quite then- they probably didn't know I was associated.  I turned myself into a ball of energy.  Somehow they sensed it.  I slowly floated over the glass door of the rumpus room (no ceiling) and met her in the bathroom.  When I came back, they knew, and they were going to hurt me.
