 I'm skiing with my brother Wally and his roommates. We're about to go up a chairlift. I'm then on a class skiing trip. I go up the chairlift alone. There is a chair very close behind me. Several of my women classmates are in it. The chair lift goes through spaces between cement pillars. I duck so I don't hit my head. We see some bird-like animals near a patch of trees. There are several birds: one is a wild turkey, and another is a baby wild turkey. We get to the top of the hill. There's a very steep drop, rounded with hard-packed snow that leads down to a town at the bottom of the hill. I ride the lift off the steep hill face, over the edge, and it makes a U-turn back towards the hill. I'm not on the seat, and I hang onto a cable until I get back over the ground so I can jump down. I hop off. My skis are still on the chairlift: I'm not wearing them. I get them somehow. I think I should've gotten off the lift just as it reached the top before it made the U-turn. My skis slide down the hill as I watch despondently, annoyed. People help me by bring them back up to me. I lose my hat and my map, which fall down the hill. People help me with these too, bringing them back up. One of the people who help is my classmate Shawn or Ryan Bay. I am very clumsy at the top of the hill. I'm very excited and happy to be here, and to start skiing. It's a nice place. I see some people on the chairlift coming up that I know from high school. I want to tell them to get off before the U-turn. My classmate from Brimson Heather Beckers appears with the skiing group. I'm pleasantly surprised to see her. I think this is a good opportunity for me to get to know her, and court her.
