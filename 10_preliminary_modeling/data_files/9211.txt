I bought a small home and was doing some minor renovations before I moved in. Daddy was there to help me. as were Albert S and Dwight W. We were walking around the house talking about the things that needed to be done. It was a two-story home. Daddy asked if I had a flashlight. I hesitated and then said I was pretty sure I had one in my car. Before I had a chance to go get it a couple of other things were mentioned, like light bulbs and toilet paper. I thought I should just drive to my current home and pick up a number of things and come back. Mother and another woman close to her age came in. The five of us were standing in one room talking. Dwight W mentioned something about how he and Albert S treated me in grade school versus how we get along now. He walked up behind me, bent over a bit since he is quite a bit taller than I am, rested his chin on my shoulder, and put his arms around me as he talked. Everyone was smiling and chuckling as he said something about how well we get along now. I didn't find it amusing, but told him that was his good fortune. Before I left, I asked if they thought it would be possible to create a separate doorway into the master bedroom. Right now, the only entry was through a second bedroom, which would be my daughter's room. I didn't want to have to go through her bedroom all the time to get to mine. There were only two bedrooms in the house. It was an older home. The wall they would need to put the doorway was currently covered with dark paneling. They didn't seem to think it would be a problem.
