 I'm at Brimson, going through the lunch line. I get a lot of food. My extra portion is a big corned beef sandwich with lots of ketchup on it. The cashier tells me I have to pay $11.70 for it. I get really mad, and say I shouldn't have to pay for it. I give her $12.00. She also things that it is a lot of money to pay for a sandwich
