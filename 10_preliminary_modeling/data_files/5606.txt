[1997-06-05] I guess I died in this dream because I went to heaven and I was surrounded by this gigantic Angel Choir, singing different hymns, things you see when you die, in fact they had me try out and I was so good that they had me become part of the choir. I guess we had good times if you can say that angels have good times. At least I knew I was on the side of the good guys and not down in Hell with the devil.
