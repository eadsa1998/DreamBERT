I'm leaving a big dorm-like house, choosing the people I want to say cafe to. Hugging. I go out and see that my van has been stripped. All four tires are gone. Someone says, "Don't worry. We're fixing it back up." I see a gas station. I go back into the building to get the rest of my stuff. I'd been too quick to leave and hadn't gathered up all my possessions. I go upstairs and look in the different rooms and get stuff.
