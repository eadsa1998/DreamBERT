A house was being built. Men were sneaking up a cable and hiding in the building, evading the law. They pretended to be workers. A patient on the ward named Perez came into the building, and an old man there wanted to abduct him by forcing him into a truck. They fought, and the patient was overcome and was driven off in the truck.
