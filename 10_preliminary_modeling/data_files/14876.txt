Ezra was watching something and I realized it was It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia and I went "Charlie!" and Mac was also in the scene. I said Charlie was my favourite but I liked Dennis more now because of his hilarious facial expressions. He asked, "Which one's Dennis?" and I said the tall, skinny one and pointed him out. I said that Mac annoys me.
