Russ's dog bit me on the arm. The dogcatchers came for him and took him away. We walked thru mud. I had the hose and put water on the dog to keep him away. I saw a man murder about three policemen and a detective with a dagger. He was found with a black jack. I was going thru the colored section and there was one colored man bothering me till a champ of some kind of theirs came and he let me go. I flew with Bob. I was writing my names in my book and I saw a picture of a black horse in it. I heard Birdie and Convenient.
