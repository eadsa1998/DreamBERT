I am over at Uncle Jack's house.  Patty and Joe's uncle or cousin or some such relative on their mother's side says he will take us for a ride in his new car.  We go out and look at it.  To my amazement and delight, there sits a sky-blue 1957 Lincoln convertible with the top down.  Pretty soon we do go out in it, but with the top up.  Patty asks him if he will put it down, and after a while he does.  We stop in the part of town where the girl mentioned in the previous dream lives and go around the corner to look for her.  The buildings are two-story and kind of small and shabby.  I don't see her.  I come back a couple of times while we are riding around, but I still don't see her.
