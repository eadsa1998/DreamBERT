 I'm at the Louvre, which is a theatre in downtown Wilmerton. I see my high school friend Gino Teavor, and he says my catch phrase to me: "Sluuu, Shhaaaap." I go in the theatre. My high school classmate Daryl Yeller has bought me a ticket. Gino tries to get him with an Uno card, instead of a regular card. A lady catches him. It is a very small theatre. I sit in front next to Daryl. Gino sits across the stage from me. He has to sit with his underwear off. He has no clothing on the lower half of his body, but uses his red underwear to cover up his groin. The others and I laugh at him. My friend Sam Kingsley dealt drugs when we were younger. I'm at an old classmate, Jerome Michaels' house. One man is tied up there. Another man is standing. Jerome's roommates are beating the men. Finally, I say, "Stop, don't beat him when he is tied up, he needs a chance to fight back." The two men that were doing the beating come after me. I smash their heads together repeatedly, and throw them through the microwave. They have a dog there. I treat the dog badly. I leave in my mom's station wagon. I want to get away before they get help and come after me. I drive down the road, which seems to be an alley or a sidewalk. There is a glaze of ice over the road. I am then on a bicycle in an alley. I bunny hop a steel cable which is running parallel to the direction I am going. I hear that a man from my home community, Walt Thompson, has died doing construction. Abraham Lincoln wrote a lot of books that are only now being discovered. The cheapest of these books costs $4,000. I'm in the garage at home in Oak Valley. I put my bicycle between the chimney and the west wall of the garage. Walt had helped build the house. He stored old artifacts in a box or compartment in the house.
