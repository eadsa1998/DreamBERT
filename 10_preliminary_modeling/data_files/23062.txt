I was in the line to check out in a supermarket and was clowning around with the guy just in front of me, whom I had never met before and was there with his wife.  I don't remember the nature of our clowning, but we got acquainted in the process and found that we were neighbors.  It seemed my wife Bonita and I had just bought a new townhouse, and they lived in the nearest building of a nearby garden apartment complex.  Their door was very near outs-directly opposite it, with the building at a slight angle.  I was glad to have made friends so close by.
