The remembrance I have of the progress of this dream, I was standing in front of a desk. On the desk was seated one of the girls in our dorm who is a year ahead of me. I seemed to be being interviewed and then I realized that I was trying out for radio club. Next I was aware of one of the fellows who is in radio club. I don't know him very well, but I do know that he is in his 20's. He was looking me up and down, considering my fitness for the club. The girl at the desk said I think she will be okay, don't you? He replied shortly no, her legs and ankles are too fat. The case seemed to be closed and no one argued his decision. That is all I remember before I woke up.
