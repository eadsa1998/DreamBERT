I was with BJ and I think someone else. We were going to a strip mall or drove by one. It was the strip mall where SFI was but it was completely redone so that I hardly recognized it. All the stores were on the same level as the parking rather than having to go up steps to get to them. The outdoor mall in front of T.J. Maxx was now filled in. The outside was mostly white with bright pretty colors for accents and signs. I pointed out SFI and told BJ that is where I used to work but commented on how different it looked and also pointed out some of the differences. We went inside. I couldn't believe how different it looked. It was a long, narrow store. With new pretty fixtures. There was very little merchandise. I don't even remember seeing any clothing. There was a very long sales counter. All of the people working in the store were Caucasian. I asked if Lisa S was still the DM and they said no. I wondered if I would be able to get in touch with her. Somebody was after me and I was standing in front of a counter just like this. One of the employees pulled out a rifle and told whoever it was chasing me to get out before they called the police.
