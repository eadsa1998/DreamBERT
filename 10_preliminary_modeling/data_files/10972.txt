The dream took place in a hotel where I was staying. There was a lot of confusion and noise. Everyone around seemed to be happy and festive. There were a lot of young people there. I was discussing things of interest with them. Then I was in another room. And in this room, in the bathroom, next to the bathtub, was a huge chair set up high. The chair itself was yellow leather and it was braced with large pieces of wood and made to look like a throne. The bottom of it was decorated in white tile, as was the bathroom. Then I noticed that draped here and there were rhinestone bracelets and necklaces; and gold belts with pseudo-jewels in them. Later I learned that this throne was used as a prop for the stage play of Macbeth. The person to whom it belonged was a young man about 27 years of age. He had dark hair. Someone was asking him how he got so many people to give up their rhinestone necklaces, bracelets and gold belts permanently for the construction of this throne. This man kept saying that the people didn't mind at all. This seemed to cause an argument between the two. Then I woke up.
