 My friend Bubba Hacker and I each have a place to live. He has just turned 21. He shows me his new driver's license, and a temporary photograph, which is of his family. He had them taken in Lakeville, so I am assured I can get mine there. I think about leaving where I am. People leave Bubba's place, so I go over to see him. It seems that we each have trailer homes to live in. We look at photographs. Some of the photographs are of my cousin Melvin Redding at a beach with a watermelon. Others are of my friend Kevin Simpson and I fishing. There are some photographs of me with a big northern pike. In one, the fish is flipping around, flopping. In it, I have blood squirting from my finger because it has been cut off or cut. I had been at Bubba's place earlier, back when the people left. There are two little boys outside: they are five and six years old, respectively.
