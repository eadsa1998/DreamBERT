I dreamed that I was up at the coffee shop in the 6th floor of Jackson Hospital with Martha and Jeff. Then Roger came in with a piece of the EEG and she said that my eye movements were very sharp and distinct and they were really good. I must have been having a vivid dream. Then I was walking across this large, wide open space on the roof of the med school building there. It's brick on top, but there's nothing but blue sky up above. I looked back and this girl Phyllis was following me and that was it. Day residue: Practically the whole dream was day residue. The day before I had spent some time having coffee in the coffee shop in the 6th floor of Jackson and there's a walk back from the coffee shop that's an open air with a brick floor. Jeff and Martha have both been lab partners in the past experiments, and Roger was mentioning the fact that in a vivid dream, the eye movements were more sharp and defined. Phyllis is a dependent little person that always follows you around asking questions.
