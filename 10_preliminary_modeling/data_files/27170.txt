I recall that my dream began with the sensation of getting off a boat. I was laughing at someone in front of me but I do not recall who it was. There was no one else around at that time. The next thing I remember was that I was in some large building of some kind, yet I remember that the building was surrounded by water and that I was walking all by myself through a dark tunnel way of some kind. All of a sudden I ran into a teacher I had. in high school, my chemistry teacher a woman I hated thoroughly. In my dream I was pleased to see her. With her was a girl that I met one summer while traveling. They asked me to get them a radio so they could listen to some music. I told them I couldn't because I was lost and I remember that I was awfully hungry. They told me that there was no food anywhere. I remember that I began to get frightened and tried to run. The door would not open so I ran the other way for what seemed to be hours, and the next thing I remember I was in my living room. Everyone in the room was looking out the windows at a big lake. On it were millions of big boats and they were all on fire. Then I recall trying to get away from the window but a crowd kept pushing me nearer and nearer the burning boats until finally I was surrounded by fire at which point I woke up to find myself standing up against the head board of my bed.
