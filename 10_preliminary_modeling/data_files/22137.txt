I was alone on an island. I was shipwrecked. On the island there was only a coconut tree. I was seated and looking at the horizon, waiting to see a ship, but I wasn't worried. I stood up and looked behind me and saw that the island was no longer very small. I saw trees, I walked and then I ran. There was lots of vegetation. It was a wonderful beach with white and very fine sand. I was starting to see many people, but they were all dressed like in the 20's. Only myself and a girl were dressed in the present style and nobody was surprised. We walked hand in hand and everyone greeted us. There was a car accident and a friend of mine (M) was hurt. then I awoke.
