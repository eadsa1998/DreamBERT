 I go into The Country's Best Yogurt with my dad and three siblings. We have $20. That's four dollars each, I figure. What I want costs between six and seven dollars. I give my brother Wally three dollars. The lady asks me what I want in it (i.e. in my yogurt). I say I don't know. She asks if I like ice cream. I say yes. Then she adds a catalyst to the yogurt to make it ice cream. There is an awful lot to eat; too much for me.
