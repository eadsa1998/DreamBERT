This dream started out sort of confused. I was with this group of people and we were walking somewhere. It was not exactly a procession, but it was somewhat. I gathered some grass and some twigs. We were going to the big church. It seems that these people I was with were Catholics, and we were going to some sort of religious ceremony. We were going to this particular church because there were some Zulus there. And somehow it was important that they had something or other that we were supposed to get to use in our ceremony, and just as we got up to the church, this group of people found out they weren't Negroes, but they were dressed in these skinny orange costumes. We went into the church and there weren't any pews or anything. One person who is the leader had the little incense burner. She was sitting front of the rest of us who were lined up against the wall. I thought this was sort of a funny group of religious people and none of them were particularly religious, and I didn't understand what the ceremony was about. And about this time somebody came in. It was the husband of one of the people in the group, and they said they had some work to do. And then I saw that there was a microscope and a typewriter set up on a table over in a corner of the church. And so everybody said, well, they would go out then if this person had to do the work. Then I was doing the work. I used to work for the University School Library and it seemed I was doing some work for them again. I was typing up cards for the catalogs. There was one card that I was supposed to type up and I kept making mistakes. I couldn't ever type what you have to type. These things have to be just exactly so, and I couldn't copy it right. And I tried over and over again, and every time I did, something was wrong. And so after working on this for quite a while, I woke up.
