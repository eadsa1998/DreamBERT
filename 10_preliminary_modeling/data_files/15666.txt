I was at home, alone, at night. I heard weird noises and caught a glimpse of someone out the back. I text Mom and told her to hurry home. I was sitting on my bed. Then I heard more noise and a guy came into my room. He was quite tall and blonde and was wearing a silver wedding ring and had big hands. He crouched at the bottom of my bed and said he wasn't going to hurt me. He started talking about something random that seemed vaguely familiar. I heard Darren's scooter pull up outside and he asked what it was and I asked if I could check if the light had gone on outside. I opened my curtain and said that Darren was back. He took my mouse as a 'hostage' and walked off. I pulled it out of the computer as he walked away so it wouldn't pull and said 'no, please'. He went out the back and said he needed to stay for a while. I went out to greet Darren. The guy turned on the back light and walked outside the window in the back room. Darren didn't seem fazed. He stayed a while (days or something), and he was kind of cute and I would keep looking at him and he'd look at me and I'd look away. There was some tension there. One night he kissed me and I resisted, but he kept going and I gave in and we had sex. There was some movie set on this boat. The people finally managed to escape and got onto a lifeboat and started going towards this thing, but someone shot it and it exploded. Some people landed in the water and they got trapped by this spiky defense mechanism.
