 I'm in a house where there is a party/barbeque going on. Most of the people are outside. I am with my wife. The host kills her. I am beaten, and am bleeding severely. I get up and stumble out the door, running. The people at the party see me and are shocked, saying to the host, "What did you do to him?" The people come after me. I'm running through neighborhoods trying to escape. There are secret agents helping me. They have clues. I get to agent # 307. He is standing in 1.5 feet of snow. A car goes by and he signals to it that this is the spot. I may be in the car, or it may be the bad guys. I punch a hole in the snow and reach down and grab an apple, which is the clue. The agent reads it. There is a car there with my classmates Robyn Masters and Dolly Storms in it. They have guns, some of which are real and some are water guns. I knock the real guns out of their hands and get in the drivers seat. I hit the accelerator, and the wheels spin. I move slowly at first, afraid of being shot. My friend Tim Zelling grabs on to the rear passenger side door, and is dragging along as I drive. <br/
