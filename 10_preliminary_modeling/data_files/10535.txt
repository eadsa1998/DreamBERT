They have a special bus to take them to the airport for a trip to the Holy Land. I am at church while Nevena (his daughter) and Valery (her daughter) get on the bus. I see Father Andrew, with grey hair, as he approaches. I ask him, "Do you have even a few minutes before you leave?" He waves me away, as if to say "how can you ask this when we are about to board the bus?" Somehow I follow him and Nevena and Valery onto the bus. Nevena shows me all the stuff she packed to carry on the plane. Before we know it, the bus is moving and we are at the airport. I panic and then ask the bus driver how I can get back? I offer to pay.15 cents. The bus driver says: "If you are willing to sit in the aisle seat #39 in the back of the bus, you ride back free with the next party. I am intrigued by all the pedals at that seat: harmonium, pedals, air conditioning. Then the Camden's dog Buffy is brought through the aisle, and he recognizes me and jumps up playfully and snaps at my fingers. I say, "As if I'd needed more proof that I know them well." I ride back and get off at a place where a lady is sunning herself in a lounge chair. She is wearing a bright turban and shows me her dance schedule. We talk about dance and music. She shows me a dance step and says: "I used to be Frau Greenway." (My name used to be Green). I say, "I remember you."
