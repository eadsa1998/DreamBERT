I'm walking down a school hallway. I'm talking with some student associates. I'm getting ready to teach a career planning class. I start looking for a bathroom. I can't find one. I see a person (male), in a wheelchair. He's asking for some assistance. The person he's asking is also in a wheelchair, but not as bad off. I am cheerful. I say, "Can I help?" I go over and adjust his legs on to the foot petals. I ask him if there's any thing more he needs. He's shy and seems to need something but I don't understand. I fuss about for awhile. Then I go looking for a bathroom. The way to it is blocked, so I decide to go to my class. I walk in on Jolene's class. Then I find my own class room. Everyone is working very hard and industriously. I look on the blackboard. Written up there are the daily assignments. I see a calculator-like device with finger holds like a telephone and a "letter reader" device. The front flap folds up over the letters and you can see through the slots. I compliment the class on how well they've been studying unsupervised. I apologize for being a few weeks late. They smile happily at the compliment. I sit on a table in the middle, right of the room. A voice is heard. "Sam," it said. A woman student says "Who else wants to bet it's Henry?" I am pleased that the class is so on the ball. Then a scene unfolds like a film. Black women are somehow scary, or wrongfully accused, or something. I decide to drive my VW Bus out of the class room. I'm concerned about blocking the view of the film for students but I do it anyway. I'm concerned about not making the sharp corners to get out of the room.
