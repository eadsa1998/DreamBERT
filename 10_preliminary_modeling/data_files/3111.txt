I am talking with someone like Frank from Murphy Brown. I say with regret, "I had the shortest relationship of my life. We met thursday night and by Friday night, it was over, but at least I had some (meaning sex)." They commiserate with me. I look outside to see the other people all grouped together in two large groups. The group on the left is Palestinians, Jews and European whites. The one on the right has disabled people, people of color, etc. I say to the leader of this conference, "I want us to do a circle dance and I want to lead it," because I notice that we are still grouping with people we have some knowledge of and not opening up to people who are different. So I go out to organize it. The leader thinks it's a good idea, but doesn't particularly want me to lead it. Maybe I should just be in it, not lead it. I walk around telling people to connect with others that are very different from them. A Ted Turner kind of man comes up to me and says he prefers fat people. I think, "Yeah, that's considered different too." He goes on. Then he comes back and says, "Are you fat?" I hesitate and say, "Well, overweight, some, yeah." He decides to stay by me in the circle, which makes me a bit nervous. He might like me. I am wearing jeans and walking and look pretty fit and in good shape.
