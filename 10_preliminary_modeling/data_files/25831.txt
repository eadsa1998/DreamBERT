 I am fishing. My friends Niles Zelling, Melvin Dahlheimer, cousin Nisa Redding, and others are there. A recycling truck comes. The large containers of recyclables are flipped over in a truck. People are instructed to leave if they haven't been exposed to this type of contamination before. I have been exposed to this before. We are in the recycling truck and wait for the process to be complete. Metal doors flip or move, as it is complete. Melvin looks concerned about the contamination. I get out of the truck. We use leeches and slip bobbers to fish. One man in our party gets a fish. We all move down the shore a ways. I throw two lines out. Nisa wants very badly to catch a smallmouth bass.
