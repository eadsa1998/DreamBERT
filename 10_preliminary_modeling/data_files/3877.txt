["Multi-colored Charla."] I am crying, very upset and hurting. Charla is being disrespectful and making me angry. I insist she go to her room stay there until she can be respectful to me. She laughs at me contemptuously. I angrily walk back to the tasks I was doing, maybe in the kitchen. I am still crying, feeling great pain and overwhelmed by all I have to do. I go back to check Charla. She is taking a bath and I am furious. This is goofing off. I told her not to do anything. Her hair is full of shampoo and I grab her roughly by the nape of the neck and I slap her and shake her. I am aware I am out of control and doing and saying hurtful things that are wrong but I can't seem to stop. I feel guilt and am driven to continue. Charla is arrogant and doesn't stop pushing at me. I am washing her hair and as I look more closely, I see many different colors of hair. It is dyed pink, purple, blue, and other bright colors. I ask her why she did that. She shrugs her shoulders and says because she wanted to.
