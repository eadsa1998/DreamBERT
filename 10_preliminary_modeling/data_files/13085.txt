Rose, Martha, The Doctor (David Tennant) and I were hanging around. Rose and Martha were annoyed at each other. Some big alien bloke thing came and pulled the TARDIS underground and replaced it with some toy thing. He knew it was a time machine. We all ran off and the Doctor and one of them ended up somewhere else. I went in this shop looking for them. I ended up in this arena and saw The Doctor, and I found him because I saw his coat. There was this virtual tennis, but not. The tennis ball would fly out at the crowd. A monster came and the lights went out. I was hiding with The Doctor. We were climbing up a pole and it had these spiky things. It fell, but I was ok.
