I was in the backyard.  There was a small monkey on the overhang wearing an orange vest, hat, and green cap.  I put my arms out and he jumped into them, heavier than I expected.  I asked if he wanted the Halloween clothes off and I helped him out of them.  There was something about Grandma Jane's parakeet Penta being free.
