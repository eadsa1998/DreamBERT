I dreamed that I had a gun and was at home. My mother and father were there also. We got in a big argument about something then I pulled out the gun and shot them both. I dreamed I ran out of the house and into the street. I ran and ran until I came to this empty house out in the country. I enter it. After being in the house for a while there appeared on the wall faces of both of my parents. I ran out of the house but the faces keep following me in the back of the house was a well. The faces came at me until they had backed me right up to the well then I fell in and awakened.
