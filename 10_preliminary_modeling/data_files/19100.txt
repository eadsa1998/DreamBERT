Recall is very fuzzy for this. Only a small fragment can be recalled. In the dream there was something that stood for eye movements and it seemed as if I were watching these on a chart so that I would look at the chart and comment just to myself. I believe that the eyes must be moving now, and it seemed as if I were the observer of some other person's eye movements. Then at the very tail end of this, it became tied in to myself so that if this thing over on the left means eye movements for that person, then this thing on the right which I'm doing must mean eye movements for me.
