I was starting school and that things had really, really changed. We were in this auditorium that kind of put me in mind of a cross between the Hayes High School auditorium and the gym at Bancroft Middle School. The seats were not just slanted a little bit, but they were like way slanted like bleachers are. And they were different colors like in the Hayes High School auditorium, but there was this big, wide open space down in front of the seats that they said for assemblies and stuff they set up a stage. And I had the notion that for chorus class there was going to be this male performer opera singer going to teach it, and for some reason I had the notion that he wasn't as good, that he was very basic. And I reasoned in my head that the more advanced classes were going to be taught by Mrs. Dougherty, but that this man was going to teach kind of the introductory and beginning and basic classes. And I can't remember too much, so I woke up.
