[I'm doing something with a group who may or may not be SCA - we're dressed up, and doing some singular stuff, but I'm not sure it isn't for real.] I've been sent to a house where an SCA revel/council/court is going on. I'm meant to be a hero, here to help them do something. This house is a bit like a brownstone, has steps leading up to a big front door, could've been very grand. I've come alone, and I'm received as an emissary. They seem glad to see me. I've got on masculine clothes, rather Elizabethan I think but hardy. I'm greeted by the leader [I don't know his title - may even be a king] and clapped on the back. We're going in to dinner first, I understand, then we'll confer. I follow them down a hall and outside to a small yard where there is set a long table for a meal. There are already a number of people seated and some serving, and I stop to speak to a few of them, and I'm introduced around. As I come to the other end of the table I start to look where to sit, which I presume should be near my host, but he doesn't seem to be here, so I'm not sure I should sit down yet. Shortly he and the entourage come back in looking for me - we're not eating at this table, there's a room further on we're going to. I get the impression they wouldn't sit with these people - they're like the servants and commoners - and they think it unsuitable that I should have thought we'd be sitting there.
