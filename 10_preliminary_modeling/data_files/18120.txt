My husband and I were in this house, in one room of it. In another room of it, which we could see, through the door were two people, fifteen years older or so than ourselves, I guess. A man and a woman were lying on this bed, not exactly making love, but they were playing around with each other. We also were having sexual play, but we weren't so much excited as we were just in very high spirits. We apparently didn't care that these other people were in the next room and they apparently didn't care that we were in there. But then the man came out and said he had just gotten word that the son and his boss had gotten this contagious disease that was very dangerous. I got it somehow. I don't know exactly what are the symptoms, but I knew I had it. And I went into this next room with the man and woman in bed and there was a big cupboard in the kitchen and it had a variety of different types of food in it. And I got a bottle of vinegar and drank some of it and then someone said to me it didn't matter because they didn't know for this plague what they could eat to cure it. Apparently there had been an army of plagues. I was rather scared, I guess, but I wasn't terribly frightened that I had this.
