People I know are on a long BUS TOUR - the bus has stopped near where I live. I talk to the bus driver a young, blond man, and ask him to wait while I get everyone some food! I find some cookies or candies and have to break them up to get enough for all. I come back to give him the food and they are all ASLEEP. --I am on the bus with Earl &amp; RUTH, talking with them discretely, so I cannot be overheard. I see Marita as a child, very skinny but all dressed up and riding a pony in a circle. Then I see her get up and stand on the pony without holding on!! I am amazed.
