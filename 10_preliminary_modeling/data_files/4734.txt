I decide to find out where the male director lives. I see the back end of my van as I drive down a street looking for him, only he is now a she. Lisa, not Perry. She sees me drive by. I see me turn left, pretending I am lost. Now me the observer sees a woman in a wheelchair who says she leaned into the experience too much and fell over backwards and hurt herself. Now I see a pretty woman from last dream walking down a sidewalk perpendicular from the wheelchair woman. Now I am running with her and we are at exactly the same place as the end of the last dream. We race into the bathroom and try to lock the doors. This time the doors lock good. I realize the alien is in the pretty woman and say to it, show yourself. Another irony. I had just locked myself IN with the alien. The pretty woman falls back on the toilet unconscious, like the alien will come out of her. I try to see the alien. Nothing is there. The doors are secured. I feel OK. I wake up.
