A woman friend is going to travel with me to L. City (?) (Pedro there now) I spend a lot of time getting the airline tickets ready. As I am working on explaining things to her, she looks to the wall by the deer and sees that the painting of WALLY's she had bought is missing. Quickly I explain that I loaned it to Hillary. Actually I had sold it to Hillary, partly because this person had not picked it up in time. So I call up Hillary and explain that the original buyer was here to claim the painting she had purchased. Then I get into the car and drive over to Hillary's to pick up the painting, but wake up (3 am) before I get there......
