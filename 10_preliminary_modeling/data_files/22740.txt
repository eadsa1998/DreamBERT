I can hardly remember anything, only a part in which I was sitting next to the door on the telephone table and was talking to a friend (male) whom I couldn't stand before because he wanted to marry me. In my dream I laughed a lot and pushed his stomach because he was very fat. I didn't have any negative feelings.
