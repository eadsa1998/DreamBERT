I remember sitting at a dining room table. There was lots of food at the table and I was avidly eating, though I don't remember what kind of food it was. My dormitory friends were in the dining room too. All of a sudden, I noticed a girl who had graduated and had come back for a meal. I was real happy to see her, and I called out hello to her and how good it was to see her. She was quite indifferent and didn't return as enthusiastic a hello. I felt a bit thwarted.
