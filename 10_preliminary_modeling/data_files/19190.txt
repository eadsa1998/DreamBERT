I was dreaming about a man who was relating a story to this, he looked like an Omar Sherif, and he was telling us how he was taking these candid camera-like shots through an electern with a hole in it. They're kind of secret shots of a group or class or something, I'm not sure. The problem he had was getting the film wrapped up to be processed and developed, and he had this set of instructions that came with the film and the camera. They were real juggled up, messed up things. They looked like, it was a magazine fold out section. It looked like it came out of Mad Magazine. It was s special offer deal where you send the film into so and so, and they would send it back to you. It was easy to take the film out. I mean, if you looked at the directions, all you had to do was pull down a section of the film and then tear the rest of it loose, and roll it up. When we got the film all rolled up and packaged, that was the end of the dream. Day residue: Omar Sherif was on a television program last night, Behind the Doors in Hollywood or something.
