I dreamt of school. I often dream of my schoolmates. I dreamt that 6 of us from my class were very naughty. We would throw water on the floors of the school and we would change teachers when they did not come. We had made reforms in our school and we were planning on taking them to the Education Department so that these reforms would be put into effect all over the country.
