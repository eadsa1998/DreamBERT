I asked the blond young man sitting in the second of the row of chairs, "Have you finished dinner and are you now in line?" He said, "Yes." "Now I must go and help my circle leader at the ditch digging near our house." "Where is that?" I had trouble remembering but at last said, "The foreign language building." "Oh yes, I know where that is." "Now I must be off to the ditch digging," and I set off.
