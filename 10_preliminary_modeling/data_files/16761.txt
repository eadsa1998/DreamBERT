I see myself in the mirror and my eyes look a bit strange, like I'm high on something, but I thought it was a cool punk look and I kept it. I wanted some eyeshadow to make the fact more obvious, I suppose. Then, I pick up 4 small English muffins somewhere, and put one in my mouth (it tastes bad) and then I go to the bathroom. Then I'm thinking about going to Katherine's house, telling her I need some eyeshadow for a play I'm in the next day (it would have been a lie, an excuse), and then asking her to go for a walk with me.
