This first dream takes a little bit of explanation. It was about the neighbors in the apartment next to ours and he is Mexican. He's about 32 and she's from Ohio, around 25-years-old. He has a real bad temper and also has this idea that man is the very dominant one in the marriage and children should be seen and not heard. She is sort of strange because she never raises her voice when he's around, but when he's not there, she'll shout at the children herself. The dream I had seemed sort of ridiculous, but it was horrifying at the time. I dreamed that we didn't live in quite the apartment we live in now, more like one we lived in several years ago in which the bedroom was next to the apartment beside it. I was in bed at night fairly late and couldn't get to sleep. My husband was out somewhere and hadn't come home yet. This couple were going to leave the next day, she to go up to Illinois for a while and he was going to Mexico, which, in fact, is going to happen in a few days. All of a sudden I heard him shouting at her. I was sort of horrified and aghast because when he gets angry, he sounds as if he is going to kill somebody. He was chasing her around the apartment. I could hear because I could hear these footsteps. She was never raising her voice at him, sort of trying to pacify him the way you would a child or someone who is insane. It went on for quite a while. He shouted at her. Finally it stopped and my husband came home and I started telling him about it. It doesn't seem like so much when I remember it, but I remember it was a real horrifying sort of dream.
