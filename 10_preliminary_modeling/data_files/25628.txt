 Darth Vader has a long thin black shoestring for a light saber. I see a bunch of rebel ships flying to Cloud City. None of them make is back except the Millennium Falcon. At one point I control the Millennium Falcon with my movements. There other ships are shot down. At Cloud City, there is a hand that reaches down out of the ceiling. The hand makes greasy pizza. I have my green duffle bag and my skis somewhere. There is an Asian couple with a big bin for their luggage.
