I am talking with a woman from the Retreat Center and she tells me that things are "more relaxed" here now; She says that they no longer have two settings for the meals and that people can eat when they wish to go. I like the idea, but then I go to find a bathroom: I have to go thru a NARROW corridor and find a very filthy bathroom, I am disgusted and thinking that I do not like that "Laissez-faire" attitude after all. earlier: I was at a dance and was whirling around with Zena- good feeling.
