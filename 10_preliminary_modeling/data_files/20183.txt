I was with my mother. She took a box and said she wanted to make a swing with it. A lady came out of the store, and I said maybe we'd better ask her if we could have the box. Just then she recalled that she had left a stick of butter in the store. She said she would give me a reward if I found it. I went into the store and saw a stick of butter on a counter with other items.
