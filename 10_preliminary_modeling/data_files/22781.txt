I go to a ball game with Uncle Ben and Aunt Aimee.  The ball park has lights, stands, very short but high wooden fences.  McAddo High is playing.  As I am standing by the bench, Coach Bowles tells me to play center field.  This means I may get to bat this inning.  The coach gives me detailed instructions on how to hit the pitcher-how to stand, what to look for, etc.  I look at the pitcher, and to my amazement he is just lobbing the ball.  And the fences-strangely wire now--are ridiculously close.  The batter just before me makes the last out.  Thinking the game is over, I walk out of the gate.  Then I find out that the game is not over.  I ask the lady selling tickets if I may go back in, since I just came out.  She says no, so I watch the rest of the game from outside the fence.  McAddo High loses.  Aunt Aimee says that some friends are coming by to take them home.  She doesn't want to ask them to take me home, so requests that I call Grandpa, Mother, or someone else to come and get me.  I am greatly dismayed.  It is 11:30 p.m.  Somehow I get home.
