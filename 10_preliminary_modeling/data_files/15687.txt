Benjamin came to London and we met up the same day. I was talking to him with no issues and was like yay it's finally working out. Then out of nowhere, he had a girlfriend who was American. She was blonde and wore lots of makeup. I didn't like her at all. I put up with her, but when she came and they went to kiss, I just walked on ahead and didn't look back. Then they started getting really into the PDA and I just walked off. We were in a shop or something. Benjamin dissed me for playing Pokemon at some point and I said it was only because he hadn't played it. There was a weird thing with ropes and you had to climb to get to different shops and displays. I did that for a while and then checked my forum messages. Benjamin sent me one saying his girlfriend had broken up with him saying that it was my fault and she had sent me a message saying the same thing and said 'yes, you guys might be perfect for each other and you might always be interesting to him and he'll never be bored, but blah blah'. I messaged him saying I never said anything to her and I thought she was a 'personality-less bore' but was perfectly polite. I thought he'd chuck a spaz over that, but he didn't. He didn't seem too upset.
