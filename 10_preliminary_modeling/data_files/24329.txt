I was in the house we lived in during my young teens, or a place like it, and we were all locked in and scared. It was raining out, and my god, there were zombies everywhere. Society was still functional, but we weren't sure where they would be next. I knew I had to go out somewhere to get supplies, but nobody was sure what money was worth anymore. Food was scarce. I was also reporting on a story. There were other people in the compound. My family was there. I was more worried about them -- protecting them, keeping them healthy and safe. I remember looking out the back sliding glass door and thinking it was not secure, and could easily break. The view from the 2nd story deck was better, and the suburbs all around looked gray and dead. The roads would be hazardous. The public was scared and irrational and self-centered. I didn't want to deal with them, but knew I had to for the story and to get supplies.
