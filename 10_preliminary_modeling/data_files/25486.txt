 I'm at Carter School. I see my friend Matt Yams. We meet and I speak German to him. I have a car inside the school. I attempt to drive the car out of the side door by the gymnasium. It doesn't fit, so I back up into the gymnasium and turn and go down the short flight of stairs and out the front door. My old roommate's girlfriend Natasha Lens and another person are at the doors as we exit. We drive over near my friend Gino Teavor's house. People are playing football there. Among them are my friends Kory Reynolds, Gino Teavor, and my roommate Stephen Ramos. Gino really gets into the game. I play. My team is on defense. Gino's team is on offense. They get near the end zone. The quarterback throws a receiver, and someone says that is a penalty called "animosity". I agree. Gino throws a tantrum. We argue, yelling. The penalty is for intentionally passing the ball too far. I say to just put the ball back and re-do the play, on second down. Gino is really mad. He has the ball and snaps it, even though he's not the normal quarterback. He runs into the end zone. I am there, and I don't try to tackle him. I walk back to the other end of the field. Gino kicks off. The ball comes to me. Gino is still on a rampage, and he intimidates me. I catch the ball on one bounce, and am tackled for no gain. I should have tried to gain some yardage.
