Last night I had a dream that took place mostly in my own bedroom. In the dream, I was in my bedroom finishing up my cleaning duties. I could hear my two sisters having a discussion. I tried to understand what they were saying but their words were totally incomprehensible. While I tried to listen in on their conversation, I continually picked up neckties and T-shirts on my dirty bedroom floor. It seemed that I had to pick up about a hundred neckties and T-shirts. The cleaning task seemed never-ending. The quicker I picked up a tie, the more and more I found. I felt a sense of futility in my task. I took time out and looked around the floor. I saw more neckties and shirts on my bed.
