A young man and woman moved to a new island to live. I am amazed to see the mangrove tree which grows straight out of the rocks and water. The shape of the tree is unusual. It has a thick trunk, round, a circle at the top of the short trunk and two branches, one to the right, one to the left (see drawing). A snake is curled around the right branch. This is a nurturing tree for animals. The young woman has two babies in one year. They move back to the mainland.
