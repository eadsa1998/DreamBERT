A bad boy from Mexico was in a jeep and had guns. I was trying to get away from him and went in a car and drove. I went all the way to some place with high, high snow capped pointy mountains that looked like there could be avalanches. Then I drove farther and went on a trail and then it happened to be nighttime and monsters were around and werewolves. I got past them and got to a pretty place but a witch caught me. I climbed up a very high tree but then it broke so I fell down. so I climbed up the roof of a house and I jumped down into the weeds. Then I climbed up the roof again and went inside it through the open window. There were very very steep steps. I went up them, but I tumbled back down and went through the open window again and onto the roof. I jumped down again and then that mean boy from Mexico came again and started to shoot with his guns. I ran to the playground with all my friends. I got a little cut but it didn't hurt. Then the mean boy from Mexico came to the playground. I said 'stop this shooting and all that stuff" and he came over to me and said "why" and I said "go home" and then the next day me and Grandma went to the pet store. Grandma found a tiny little duckling that she brought home. I looked all around the pet store and saw frogs, lizards, bats, more ducks, and foxes, and a crocodile. I wanted to get one of the bats and then a few days later it died.
