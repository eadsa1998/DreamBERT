After packing a suitcase to leave with my husband, we began driving on country roads among the hills. I remember particularly now how green and beautiful the hills were. We decided to stop and see a mine. My husband has been there before. It was a peanut mine! We walked down many stairs and could see miners going down another stairway. We finally came to an elevator. It was in the shape of the peanut man which is in advertisements so much. I was frightened to get in it, but my husband told me it was all right. I was to count to ten aloud so that he would know when to take the next elevator. I was terrified because I didn't know when to start counting.
