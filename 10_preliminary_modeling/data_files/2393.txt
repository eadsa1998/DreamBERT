I meet this charming, sweet, young man who is magical. He senses what you want from him and then he creates it. A woman wants sweets and he magically produces them in quantity. I want to make warm, delicious love to him. He says he can only do that when there's TV around. I smile and point to my cable TV. "See? 24 hours a day," I say, quite delighted I'll have him all that time. I hug him to me, already anticipating the warm, soft, sensual good times.
