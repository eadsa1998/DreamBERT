We are about to leave for home from out vacation. I go back to say goodbye to this handsome man. He is stocky and stark naked with a big erection. We kiss and he wants to make love, but it is too public and there is too little time. I go away reluctantly, but then return a while later under the pretext that I had forgotten something. He has put up an elaborate screen, made of wallpaper so that we can have more privacy. But there still is not enough time. I promise to come back later, ALONE. Later I see him dressed and he winks at me. Later at the Book Cafe I see Margaret working on some paper work; I go over and she embraces me warmly and holds me tight. She tells me how much she loves me!! I am happy but don't quite believe her. The next day I go to work and can't decide where to park my car. vivid!
