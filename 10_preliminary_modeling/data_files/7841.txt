I worked in this office. Bob F worked there too. I was reorganizing my desktop and my cubicle. I had all these extra desktop organizers and I was rearranging them to get the best lighting and for things to be the most convenient. I put some things away in cabinets and drawers. I pulled some other things out. I remember that I had some dolls and some things of flowers. I think Michelle Stewart [unknown in waking life] was working there also. They were thinking about moving us to a different area where there were all these desks in one big open area. She had kind of staked out the area, the desk that she wanted already. She had suggested a place for me and I said that I wasn't really interested in that one. I pointed out a different area that I was interested in. She said that was fine and she would let them know that. Bob F was waiting on me. We were going home together. I kept saying just a minute just a minute. He wasn't getting really frustrated but was saying, yeah, yeah, you said that already. But then in another scene I was leaving alone. We were meeting some other people from work for dinner. We were trying to leave without getting caught by the boss I guess. Before I left I was also trying to find a place to go to the bathroom first. I was having trouble finding a place. After that the boss almost caught me before I got out of there.
