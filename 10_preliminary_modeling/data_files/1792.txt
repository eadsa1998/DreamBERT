I am at a party. I think it's a birthday party for a baby but it is for this guy. I go to sit at a table. When I sit, my chair is in the outside wall of their apartment and the other chairs at the table and the table is on the inside of the wall. I sit and pull the wall over me so I'm on the inside too. The wall must be of a stretch material with a hole in it. The irony is that when I pull myself through the wall, the birthday boy gets his head caught in a similar stretch hole. I think it looks strange. We start to eat breakfast. He asks me questions and it becomes evident he doesn't know how to run a self-publishing business. I ask him if he keeps records or receipts. He looks confused. I set out to help him set up his business better.
