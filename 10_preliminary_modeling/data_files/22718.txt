This dream is somewhat more familiar to me. I was with a friend of my same age, who is married and had two babies. We were walking through some streets that I don't know, but in my dream they were familiar to me. I was carrying one of her babies because she didn't want to carry it. The street was peculiar; it was filled with religious images, lit with candles. We walked, looking at these images, talking and laughing, until we reached or somehow got to her house, which wasn't really her house, but my grandfather's house. When we went in, her mother and nieces and nephews (between the ages of 1 and 12) were there. Her husband, who is also my friend, asked us where we had been and, I don't know why, my friend answered that we had been talking to some boys, friends of mine from the university. I then told him that they were really nice, but he was angry. Then my friend asked me to prepare some food for her children, and I said no, that she should do it herself, but as usual I started to fix something. Then they served some soup for the rest of us and my friend's husband asked me what I thought of the meat I was eating, because he thought it was terrible. His wife disagreed because she thought it was good. Then he said that he was going to the movies to see "Candy." I told him I had already seen it and he started to say that I shouldn't see certain types of movies which weren't any good. At that moment the dream plot became blurry.
