Mom, Ezra and I went to Midvale shops. It was dark and raining. We had a 4wd type of car. Mom went into the shop and Ezra and I waited outside. It flooded and there was a deep 'hole' next to the car. It all filled up and it went past my door at the back of the car. It wasn't past the door on Ezra's side (the left side). Mom called Darren to tell him to get something to get us out. Mom came out later to check on us and Darren still hadn't come -- he had seen a friend instead. Then we were somewhere else and this Cloverfield thing happened. The monster was throwing stuff around. It went over a bridge holding 'balls' of people (they were wrapped up in a ball). I was looking up at it. These people had also bought a new home. After the flood and the monster, I was wondering if they would get a new house (the house they had had survived, though). We were hanging around and Thuy and Raquel were there.
