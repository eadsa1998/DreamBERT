Serena, Carol and I think Leslie came over to my house. My house was huge, in a big field that was on top of a hill that overlooked a valley. Things seemed fine. They were outside and I was in my room. My sister came upstairs and said to me sarcastically, "Nice friends. What the hell is wrong with them?". I didn't know what she was talking about and I got defensive. My sister told me how they had sawed off the wooden Thai lady statues head and hung it from the ceiling. I couldn't believe it but then she showed me. I got really pissed at them. What the fuck were they thinking? I went outside where they were sitting on the grass. I asked them what the hell was wrong with them? Serena said she thought it was kind've funny. I grabbed a pair of her silver pumps and snapped them in half. "Do you think this is funny?" I felt angry and crazed. I had a knife - "how about this...?" I sliced a slit in Leslie's bodysuit. I then started completely trying to slash their stuff. I went inside the house and saw mom. From then on the mood was fearful. Serena and her lot were acting really vandelous and somehow there was a huge group of people also acting rebellious outside the house. Judith was their leader. I remember fearing for my mothers and for my life. Everyone starts to take off in their cars. We looked down at the valley and a long line of cars are on the road heading away. It sort of looks like a cartoon - it's a really cool angle. There is a sense of relief. Down below there is a funeral going on. All the cars stop and all the vandals get out. Now, all the women are wearing grey with grey hats, the guys are in black suits. They all crowd around the grave. A few grave over on the left there is one girl in her grey outfit dramatically mourning over a grave by herself.
