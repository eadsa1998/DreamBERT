I'm at my chldhood home. It's chaos. My mother's partner is off the rails - he's been the victim of a scam - some people heave ripped him off. He owes me money, which luckily he pays. I have a bag of bundles of cash. There are people coming and going and it turns into a nightmare to keep track of the money.
