I had invited 10-12 past clients to my home to view a movie related to dreams and then we were going to discuss it afterwards. I was wearing a sweatsuit (which I almost never do in waking life) and sitting sideways in my favorite chair with my legs hanging over the arm. It was getting close to the time I said we would start and no one was there yet. Someone finally came in the front door without knocking and everyone came in behind them. I was surprised at some of the people who showed up. We started the movie. I heard something going on upstairs. maybe Matthew up there making a bunch of noise. I got up to go up and take care of it. Halfway across the living room I realized I had taken my sweatpants off and didn't have any underwear on either. I hoped my sweatshirt was long enough so no one could see anything. It seems like I had to do this at least twice. The second time I had underwear on but still no sweatpants. When I came back down the movie was over already. It had only been an hour long. I was saying something about this to everyone, that I didn't remember it being so short, that I was disappointed not to have seen much of it with them but that I had seen it before. Everyone got up to leave. I said I thought we were going to discuss it. I don't know if they said why they were leaving or not but everyone left.
