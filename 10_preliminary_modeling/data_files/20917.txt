I was staying at a rooming house. The tenants all spoke with a German accent. I read a letter I had received, saying that the cabinet I had ordered would be sent by mail. The tenants were criticizing the French people. I reflected that the cabinet would not fit with my bed. It would have to be put in the day room where I was standing. One of the German tenants was talking about unfair business practices among the French businessmen.
