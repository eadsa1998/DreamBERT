I went with my best friend, Alixanne, and her family to get their Christmas tree. They got a tree from a spot that looked exactly like where I had gotten my Christmas tree. I told her all about how I got my Christmas tree. Setting: The woods. Characters: Alixanne, my best friend. Haley, her sister. Frank &amp; Susie, her parents. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy. The place that we really got our Christmas tree was different, but where they got theirs I remember that place from somewhere.
