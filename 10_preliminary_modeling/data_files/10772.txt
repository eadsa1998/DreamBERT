Two friends, Nancy (19) my ex-roommate and Julia, girl living across the hall in my dorm and I were in a bathroom chatting. Nancy replied to my statement with a rather sarcastic hum which in real life torments me to some extent. I got so excited that I took her head in my hands and banged it twice against the wall. She was resisting strenuously. As I was about to do it the third time, I controlled myself and stopped. I think Nancy was laughing while she tried resisting just as if my actions were amusing with no intent to injure. I don't know whether my feelings were of wanting to hurt her or just to pretend I was disturbed.
