I was in some sort of competition on campus.  There was one event each day, and five events.  I don't remember why, but I wanted to finish two days early.  The first three days' competitions were over.  For the fourth event, my boyfriend Jeremy and I went up somewhere around the science buildings.  It was a covered area, but there were no walls, more like a parking garage.  There was a table.  Jeremy was to time and judge to make sure I was doing the things properly.  The task was to turn over stacks of coins using only my mouth, in a certain amount of time.  At some point while I was doing this, an opponent showed up and began doing it as well.  Then we moved on to the fifth event.  There were cards, I think, with math problems on them.  I was not clear on what the task was.  I sat and watched as my opponent gestured around the corners of a square on the table as he did the math problems.  I barely glanced at the math, and just followed the lead, moving my hand around the squares and counting.  Afterwards he asked if I got 4.  I think I said I did.  It turned out I was wrong, but my finger was only off by one position on the table.  It wasn't until then that I realized that the math problems had some indication of the position on the square- I had gotten incredibly close by luck, but I still felt gypped by not knowing how the task worked.
