In this dream my wife and I were driving along a country road when I decided to turn the car around for some unknown reason. It so happened I ran the two front wheels into a ditch. When I backed the car across the road the two front wheels came off. After getting out of the car to have a look I discovered the car was practically demolished. My brother-in-law (30) came into the picture and I asked him how much he thought it would cost to get my car fixed. The last thing I can remember is my brother-in-law telling me to junk the car.
