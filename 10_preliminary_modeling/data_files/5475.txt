I had a weird sort of dream, I was stuck somewhere, in a doctor's office, like in an exam room, waiting for a long time and then I left. The whole office had a sort of maroon carpeting and looked like it had been a really big house at some point or something and then I walked out of the exam, the whole office, I was wandering around this big long hall and it was carpeted the same way and it had big huge windows lining the whole hall I think on both sides, and it looked kind of late out, not like real sunny and I guess I was there a really long time because a nurse came out from the doctor's office and said that I'd been there a really long time and did I have a ride home, and I suddenly realized that I didn't, that I hadn't made arrangements with the patient transport [company] to go home and that it was after 5 and I couldn't and besides, I needed 24 hours notice. And so I was wandering around the halls of this really big building looking for a phone and I think I remember going back into the doctor's office and calling D, my husband, but he was staying with his brother and his mother and I guess because his van broke or something and that he had gone to bed and I so I was wandering around this building, and all of a sudden I was with somebody. And they kept changing who they were and they changed from my best friend in grade school through high school to my best friend from high school through college, and my best friend now, and they kept switching from one person to the other and we were going all around this building and somehow we ended up in my old church, outside the sanctuary and I started to go down the stairs to the lower hall of the church and I said to my friend "I've got to find a phone, I wish I could find a phone" and the church was lit, like it always was when I could see, but it was late like it looked at night. Then she called me and said "there's a phone right here". And so I went back up the stairs, but I felt kind of scared or anxious about going back, and then I got to the phone and found that I didn't know how to use it, I finally figured out how to use it and began to dial it and I dialed 4-6 and then I realized I was dialing my parent's old phone number and that they didn't live there anymore, and they were really far away and they couldn't help me anymore and I hung up and I started to cry and I said to my friend, "nobody can help me, nobody can help me I don't belong here" and I went down this back hall which used to belong to the nursery school that was held at our church, and I was crawling down the hall and I came up to this room and I was still crawling, and I went in but it was my next door neighbor's play room from when I was little. I was crawling across the play room and I was, there were toys everywhere, like on, all over the floor like there always were there, but I wanted to get up on the couch for some reason, it looked kind of like mid-afternoon in the playroom, I think there was something else, in the playroom, like some other scene which I'm not remembering... Then my friend came back in later and I crawled back over to her and I curled up against her and I was crying "I want to go home, I want to go home" and she wasn't saying anything, but I thought that she was thinking that I was crazy for acting like a little kid.
