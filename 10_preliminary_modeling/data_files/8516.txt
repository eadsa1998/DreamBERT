There were two groups of people competing in a business challenge. The challenge was to see who could sell the most of a netting fabric they had been given. The netting is the type of thing that would be used for bride's veil, or that used to be used on women's hats. The one team came up with two ways of selling it. Though the only way I can remember is that they were selling it to stores that sold women's hats, with suggestions on different ways to add it to the hats. The other team only came up with one way of selling it. I don't remember what that way was but I kept thinking that it was for women's hats - that they should be trying to sell it that way. Mostly I felt that I was an observer, though I felt anxious for the one team.
