Oh, I smell coffee somewhere! Okay, last night I had kind of a crazy dream. I dreamt that I was in the Bancroft Middle School cafeteria, and people were getting ready to like take a test, like a SCAD or something, and they were all sitting at the table. And over in a corner my Mom was shoveling big plops of poop into a bucket, and I don't know where that came from, but she was saying, "Getting the dirty stink out of the cafeteria would help them take their tests." Well, duh! And then I must have been roaming around Westport High School or something, in the hall in front of the Guidance Office, and I heard them announcing the final exam schedule for Westport College over the intercom. And I was thinking how the high school students, they threaten them and they say, "If you don't get your exam by the scheduled time, the door's going to be locked and you won't get to." And they just say, "First period, second period, go to your next period exam." But at Westport College, when they read their exam schedule, they were a lot more, not really empathetic, but sort of along that line, trusting that the college students would know what the heck they were doing. And that's all I can really remember about this dream.
