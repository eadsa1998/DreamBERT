In this dream I was a basketball star for the professional team the New York Rams. The score was tied going into the last second. I threw the ball the length of the floor and it went in. We won the professional championship of the world. There wasn't anyone in the gym because they were televising the game and they were all home watching it in their homes. After the game the other players on my team came up to congratulate me and I notice that they didn't have any eyes. This was the end of the dream.
