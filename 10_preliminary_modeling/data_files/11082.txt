The boy I used to go with, but hadn't seen for quite a while called up--wanted a date. He lived quite far away, so I said he could stay our place that night, but forgot to ask my mother if he could stay. He came--drove a red convertible--and we three went out together. Mother rode in front with him. I rode in the back. Found out he had just gotten out of the hospital. For some reason he kept scratching his head and asked me for a Kleenex so I thought he had had a head operation. Then I just forgot he was even there as I talked to mother and tried to convince her that he should stay at our place. When I finished, I suddenly realized he was there and I was very embarrassed, as was he.
