I was in the dentist's chair. He had just administered gas and was telling me to count. I knew I was dreaming, so I didn't bother. I heard a metallic clink of him picking up his tools. He started pushing on one of my teeth. I was trying to squirm away from his grasp, but he persisted. Then I felt him pulling on my teeth, and I felt great pain at this time. Then it was out, and I was expectorating in a bowl at my side.
