I was in Barranco in a park, with a friend, Joe, who I don't see often lately, but who was my best friend in childhood. They had put up amusement rides. While I look at them, people I know from school appear. I start a small conversation with them. They tell me that they are from the "center" (those in 2nd and 3rd year in high school) and we talk about school. They tell me that the school is encouraging the football team, which at that moment is playing with Saint Louis School. I start walking with Joe along Grau Avenue. We meet another friend, whom Joe doesn't greet. I think this is tactless of him.
