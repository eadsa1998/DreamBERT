I went to this place with a group on a tour thing. There were footprints in the wall that were massive but were David Bowie's. There were hands of celebrities as part of the decor as well. I went to the place where they were filming Stalled except it was like a classroom. They set us up so we were sitting along the wall. I was looking for Dan Palmer. Somehow later, I was talking to a lady about a project and she said yes and then I went to a place and opened the door and went in and Dan Palmer and Christian James were there. I said 'she said yes' and we all sighed with relief and it was a producer for a film/TV show we were doing together. The place was empty and square with a rectangular shaped kitchen to the side. Christian James got a blanket thing and folded it up in a corner like a bed, then got this sheet and stretched it over the kitchen. I wanted a bean bag for the corner.
