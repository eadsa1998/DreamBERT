I was riding in an old Model T Ford down a macadam road with large trees on each side of the road. This road was unfamiliar but seemed familiar. There were several other persons in the car but I could not tell who they were. There was one girl in the front seat along with another fellow and myself. We were going at a great speed and I awakened as the old car (which had no top) was about to turn over going around a curve.
