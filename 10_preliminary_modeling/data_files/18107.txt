I was in NYC and I was chasing my parakeets because they ran away.  One was green and one was blue. They stopped for a rest at the Hudson River, so I bounced on them and got them.  Then I tripped and we all fell into the water.  A big, humpback whale swallowed us and a bunch of clown fish.  After a while, the whale pooped us out and then me and my parakeets were in my room.
