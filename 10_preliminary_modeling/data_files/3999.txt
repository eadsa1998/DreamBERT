["Turn off the radio"]  Charla and I are going to a special meeting at her school on Sunday. I keep trying to position my wheelchair so I can face the two women speakers. I can't seem to find them. I decide I need to turn off the radio, it is annoying me. I find the radio and push a number of buttons but no matter which one I push  it won't turn off. I feel frustrated and I give up. Now I am outside and walking. It is slippery. I see a stream of water ahead and realize I can't step over it. So I choose to go uphill, slipping on the wet grass and mud. I make it to the sidewalk. I see the bus Charla and I will take. Now a young woman, perhaps Dovre, and I are wearing push up halter tops that are black and strapless. I mold mine to hold in my left breast, as I noticed it was sort of dropping out a bit. As I approach the bus, a man approaches and makes lewd remarks. I feel annoyed by him.
