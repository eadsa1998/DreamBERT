I got sidetracked at a theme park type place where me and my brother Gerald were getting into this race around a track with three other super-fast go karts. The tracks crossed. We were in the lead for most of the time, even going the alternate passing way. But on the last lap, a car turned a corner faster than we did and jetted slightly ahead. But on the final turn, I took it on the inside, and cut just in front. The other car hit us, and we went skittering. It was unclear who won. But then the organizer, Mike Rowe from Dirty Jobs, but with a strange name and more off persona like ChrisAangel, called up the replay -- we'd spun just across the line and won. I spoke with him, he gave background, etc. and his strange name. My brother Gerald got his phone number. When I got back to the office to write the story -- the office was in the downstairs of one of the houses we once lived in, it appeared, and I had two stories and very limited time. Somewhere earlier there was also a quest for Starbucks in a wet, rainy lifestyle center type place, with a cold ice cream store like the Hagen Daas we always went to in my home town with the wicker chairs. I forgot to ask him how he came to do what he did, he said "just trying to make a buck." But I wanted to know more. I called him with my brother Gerald's phone, but the number was not working because his carrier was overloaded. I wondered if he put in the number right, but figured he did.
