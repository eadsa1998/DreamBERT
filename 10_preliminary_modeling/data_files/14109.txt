I was at this guy's house. His mother didn't like me. She thought I "killed Duran Duran". She called the cops on me. She asked if I was drunk that night and I said I didn't know because I had had drinks one of those nights. She thought I broke a guitar. We were upstairs and we both turned and I hit her and she fell down the stairs and died, but had a smile on her face, because she 'knew' I'd get in huge trouble for it. Out the back were some broken cupboards.
