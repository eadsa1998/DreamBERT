Eugene and I were going out. We went to Nana's. There was a huge meal set out like when we go up there for holidays. She hadn't met him before and she was like "oh, who are you?" and I said "a retard" and he laughed and said "I'm Izzy's... boyfriend?". I felt uncomfortable about it. I got a plate with food with a big ball of lettuce and an egg which was half white. I cut the white out and there was a black yolk which tasted funny. I said it tasted weird and Eugene said his did too. Nana said it was Vegemite and garlic and I was like 'ew'. We also both stretched at one point the same way and Nana pointed it out. I could time travel. Then I was at a place and I had to go on this playground which had slats of wood with different years on them. I can't remember why but I went to the past for a bit. I had to sing in a choir to pass it. I went further back to when Ezra was a toddler. Mom and Dad were there. We were outside and I was in the car. Mom had told me a story before of a time when she had to feed Ezra but a huge storm had interrupted her. The sky was dark and cloudy and there was lightning and it looked like bad CGI, but otherwise it looked awesome so I took out my phone to take pictures. I locked myself in the car and they left. This guy came to the window of the car and I said "you are going to get struck by lightning now". The storm started but ended quick. I drove off to find them and they were on the side of the road. I turned around and came back and they were like 'oh my God did you hit the curb?' And I said "no because I'm not a frickin' idiot"
