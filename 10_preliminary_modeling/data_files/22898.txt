I was in a hospital bed, and a doctor was examining my legs by thumping them and feeling them.  He diagnosed my problem as some kind of terminal disease-maybe cancer, but I'm not sure.  But something he discovered before the dream was over, or something I told him, indicated that my death was not as imminent as it had originally seemed.  In any case, the idea that I was going to die didn't bother me at all.
