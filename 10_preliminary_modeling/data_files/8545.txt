Matthew and bunch of his friends had been at the house for a visit-maybe 10 or 12 of them. They were getting all of the stuff that they had brought with them together, loading up cars and getting ready to leave. Kim and Chris H were with them. Kim came in and someone asked how Chris was. She said something about what he does or how he feels when he lays his head back. I told her that sounds like a concussion and he should go to the doctor. I told her in the meantime to make an ice pack and put that on it. I pointed to where the ziplock bags are and told them to get a kitchen towel, not a paper towel, to wrap it in. There was a baby in a stroller. Ashley B was pushing it outside. I knew it wasn't hers but didn't know whose it was. They had really made a mess. Even though that annoyed me I was still glad they were there. Now I am in bed. I'm sitting up polishing my nails and only have covered with the sheet. I hear Matthew very lightly knock on the door and begin to open it - he thinks I'm asleep. I grab the sheet to cover myself the rest of the way as I don't have anything on. As he enters the room, just wearing his boxers, he tells me that he can't sleep. I told him to go downstairs and put a pot of water on for both of us and I'll be right down. I also tell him not to turn the TV on as that will just work against us. I'm thinking that when I get downstairs I'll get out some turkey too, as that will also help us to go to sleep.
