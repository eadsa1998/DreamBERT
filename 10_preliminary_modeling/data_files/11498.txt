I was in a room of some kind and for some reason I had to get down to the street. The only trouble was that there were men all around with guns trying to stop me. There were three men with me and one was a Cuban. At first we started down with one going first and the Cuban right behind me. The only weapon I had was a little gun that looked like a ring and it didn't shoot straight. The first guy fired at me but I just kept on running. Then I ran into a guy with a machine gun right in front of me. I went right over him shooting at him with my gun. Somehow I got through and bullied my way through the last guy and reached the stairs. Then I was awakened.
