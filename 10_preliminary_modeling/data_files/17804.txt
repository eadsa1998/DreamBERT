On a baseball team.  We were moving new furniture into the apartment.  The only other girl on team was leaving, and asked if I'd be okay.  I told her I'm more one of the guys, so I didn't care, not discerning between genders.  I was trying to figure out how I got on the team in the first place and whether my boyfriend Jeremy was staying on the team.  We were standing on the roof.  I was surprised I stayed.  I ran to a car with a pencil to write something about dimensions and uniqueness.
