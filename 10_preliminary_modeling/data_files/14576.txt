Dad got a house in Bali. I was showing Mom pictures of expensive furniture. I was then at university but it was like, 1am. Ezra asked why it was so late and I said something about studying and he said "why are you always at [something I can't read] then?". The place that I normally did something (I can't read what it says, but it looks like it starts with an 'f') was actually close to home. I was then back home and the wall out the front had been moved out and into a 'hangman' (like, a wooden model of a hangman game). I asked Darren why and he said "you don't know what a hangman is?". They were where the grass used to be and were ugly. I was then inside and I needed to go to bed soon because I had to wake up at 6am. I was singing A Glass of Champagne. Then people kept making noises and coming into my room while I tried to sleep. A friend of Dad's was like a dominatrix and had a photo of this girl he scammed and threw it into a big bin. I was then in the car with Mom and Ezra. She was singing and I told her to shut up. She was like 'I have a good singing voice' and I said 'yeah that's why I complain every time'. Then it was night/early morning. I took a bus and got off, then took another one and I kept doing that for some reason. I also started taking trains. I pressed the button (on the bus) and I got dropped off at a $8 a night hotel/motel. I text Mom to get me. I was reading about Spongebob Squarepants because there were questions about it for something. Mr Krab was called 'Increased [something I don't remember]. He also took up some violin thing called a ventillion, or something.
