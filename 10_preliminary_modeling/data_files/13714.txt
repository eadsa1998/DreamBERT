I was in the car with Eugene, Rodney, Ezra and Dad. Sometimes Dad wasn't there. We went to Mom's and then Bradley was in the car. We were sitting so that it went Bradley, Eugene, then me. Bradley asked me if I could see if there was a coffee chill. The house was different. Mom had cleaned out some of my room (Ezra had stuff in there). I went to the fridge and there was hardly anything in there. There were some green bottles in there. Mom was playing on the computer outside. Darren was around. I told Bradley that there was nothing. Ezra was playing Counterstrike. I had a water bottle and Eugene kept drinking out of it. My hair was normal, but looked straight. Eugene and I kept being rather close.
