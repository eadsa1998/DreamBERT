A man had invented some type of machine that was the size of a small room. He convinced me to enter and try it. The benefit of the invention came from ingesting something that it created, but ingesting it while inside. It looks like bubbles floating in the air inside the machine. It is large and airy inside. It is colorful. While inside, I am discussing my experience with someone on the outside.
