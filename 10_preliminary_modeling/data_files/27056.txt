I was at a party in a very beautiful, spacious house, given by my down-stairs neighbor's sister and her husband. When I mentioned that my watch had been given to me upon graduation from Junior-High School, the host brought out a watch and gave it to me. I was very thrilled. It was only when I got home that I noticed it was as large as a saucer and was held very clumsily to my wrist by a rubber-band. Then I realized that no one gives anything away for nothing.
