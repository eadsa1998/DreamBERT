Mom, Granma and I were staying at a motel. Mom said we got room number 217 and I said "something bad is going to happen". I was thinking either a fire or a burglar. Then the owner ran out screaming "Fire!". We grabbed our stuff and jumped into the car. We had two animals -- a pig and something else. Mom went back to get them. The pig wasn't breathing and Mom gave it CPR.
