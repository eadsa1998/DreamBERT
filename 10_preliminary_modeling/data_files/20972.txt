A gorilla tried to catch me, but I flew up into the air and on top of the GTHS high school. I looked down and it was high. I jumped and flew again. I worked magic. I made objects come to me at will. I was going to school with my old school day friends again. I was watching the streetcar go by and the kids were getting on. I stood on the tracks and gave the signal when the kids were on to go. The owner's wife has two streetcar passes she was to sell. Ann said, "Sell them to my husband," but she said, "I might give them to my husband." I told her he didn't need a pass because he was the owner of the line and all the motormen knew him.
