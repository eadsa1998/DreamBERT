I was watching Kenny vs Spenny. Kenny put stuff in his hair and Spenny did something to him and he died. They resurrected him though the next morning. Then it showed what had happened in between. Spenny's 'sister' came in and had lied down with Kenny and gave him a handjob. I was like 'what the hell?!' and confused. Then Spenny dressed up as a hippy like woman, but Kenny had introduced himself to a policeman, who had called out to Spenny and Kenny realized it was him. Then I was at home, but it was different and apartment like. Luisa came over and was wearing a black dress. She wanted to take me out and I refused. I called Mom to tell her to come home.
