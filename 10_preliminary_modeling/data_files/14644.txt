Ezra, Dad and I were staying at Nana's. There were photos there from something where Samantha, Calvin and Silas had come back there after something. One of them we were sitting at a table and we looked like we were 4-5 years old, though we were actually 12. Anyway, Ezra and Dad had gone outside and I decided to check the time and it was 1.43am. It was still light outside and they were at the back door and came in. We were annoyed that Nana and that were going to wake up soon and wake us (from the kettle etc). Later I was at Mom's and Ezra had a heap of friends over. They were playing games such as soccer. They threw the ball to Ezra and he kicked it. I remember seeing Leroy and Brantley there. I went to bed early. When I woke up it was 11.26am. It only showed 'J' which was a code for 11. I was annoyed because I had missed my lab and I woke Mom, who was sleeping outside and she just fell back asleep. She got up when I asked when we were leaving for the awards ceremony. There was a scoreboard and I had 7 points in a bunch of stuff because they were using me as a placeholder or something. There was a song in my playlist that was like 'Boy name Cry'.
