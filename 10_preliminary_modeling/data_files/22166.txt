The only thing I can remember from my dream is the following: I was in the pool room with my best friend at the university. He is of medium size, blonde, 18, and dresses very colorfully. The place was the pool room at the Union Square where we always go, but there was no background; just the pool table and us. Then we were in the soccer field at the Lawn Tennis Club and he and I were playing, but the strange part was that the ball was a large billiard ball. That soccer field is familiar to me because it is there that I train with my team. Afterwards, I don't remember any more.
