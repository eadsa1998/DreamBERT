I was standing facing a plaid sofa. Someone was sitting there, a male I think. I saw a penny laying on the sofa, then just a minute or two later I saw two pennies there. The person sitting there was getting ready to eat a muffin and broke it in half. I think there was another muffin sitting there, on the sofa. It seems that he either broke the muffin open to see if there was something inside of it or because there was something inside of it. Maybe that's where the second penny came from.
