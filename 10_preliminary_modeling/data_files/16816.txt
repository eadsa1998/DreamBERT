I was walking in a lunch room having a philosophical discussion with Ron. I started talking about Eliza and said, "You know her, don't you?" Then I heard Eliza's voice. She invited us to sit at her table with her. There were already a couple of people sitting with her. We sat down and Ron joined them in a discussion. My chair was set back from the group a little bit and there didn't seem to be room for me to move it closer. I felt left out.
