I am a beautiful young woman like Audrey Hepburn, in a basic black dress, black heels and all the men watch me as I walk with grace and elegant beauty. Women are in a line and going down a steep cement stairway, no sides or rails. We then step into the water, which is thigh deep. We each come to a small water faucet like fountain and bend and take a drink. It is some ritual. As it is my turn, I see an old woman sneak in and take my turn. I graciously let her, even holding down the push button to let the water flow. Then I bend to take my drink. The woman whose turn would be next shoves me away saying, "I gave up my turn when I let the old woman drink." I disagree and try to take my drink. She keeps shoving me, so I turn and fight her, socking her in the face and knocking her down. The watching men really like and admire my feisty attitude. But the woman, her name is Betty, hates me now and keeps relentlessly coming after me. I fight her again and escape to my small black convertible sports car. She chases me through the city streets. Finally I outfox her by turning into a very narrow alley between two huge stone houses. It is a steep incline. Betty is driving a big car so she doesn't fit. Now she has friends and is walking down toward me. I tap on the small ancient glass windows, but no one responds. I pick up my black cellular phone and call 911. Sympathetic cops ask where I am and I try to describe it, then I drive away and Betty still pursues. My roads are disappearing; then I have to drive up a dirt hill, and then a sand-filled, half paved road where construction is going on. I can't seem to find a main road to get back to the city. Lots of water is pouring down on one sandy road like they are constructing stuff.
