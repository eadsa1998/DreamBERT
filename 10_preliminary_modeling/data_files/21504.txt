I was working on the roof of a shanty. A man deceased came up there and said I owe him 60 cents for a pool ticket. I pulled out my wallet and out of my change section I had four square dollars. I said, "Look what they make now, square dollars." We were looking them over, seemed some of the square edges were a little different in O.D. a little, then others. I finally gave him one of the square dollars and he gave me the change. The water gutter was not draining properly. At the end of the spout it hit the ground and then squirted up into my face. I was trying to fix it so the water wouldn't go into the neighbor's yard because they called the police and that's why I was fixing it.
