There were zombies. I was with a group of people and we were at Nana's. I jumped up on the fence at the front. As I ran I shouted "Don't open the door!". It was quiet and then zombies came and they couldn't get to me. We ended up at a shop. There were a lot of people there. We were walking like zombies. I was with this black guy and we were trying to work out who was a zombie. There was a TV and all these people were watching it. I was near the frozen foods and there was a small worker girl. Then in this back room there was a little black guy and a girl. I was said "I'm going to die because [some reason I don't remember]". There was a big snake zombie. We went outside and there were these snacks and we had to pick one. Evelyn asked me which one I was going to choose.
