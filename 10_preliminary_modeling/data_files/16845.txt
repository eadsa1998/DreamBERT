This dream is fragmented. First there was an awkward scene. I was in a bar. It was fairly spacious and mostly empty with black walls, a very high ceiling, and tall chairs on chrome posts with round black tables. I was having a drink with my partner. I went to the bar, and on the way bumped into some ex-university colleagues. I got chatting, and bizarrely, I told them a story about an infidelity which was completely made-up. On the way back to the table, I felt a terrible sense of stupidity and guilt. Why would I have said such a thing to these people? When I returned my partner picked up on my awkwardness and became suspicious and angry. Next I'm in a large underground leisure complex with interesting organic spaces that flow into each other organically. The walls are stone or concrete but pink in color - like a pink sandstone. It reminds me of some modern architecture I've seen in the past - perhaps inside the modern pyramid entrance to the Louvre. The leisure centre is bustling with people - mainly women, who are darting into saunas or pools or bathrooms in towels. The atmosphere is highly sexually charged.
