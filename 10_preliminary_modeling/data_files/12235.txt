Granma had this presentation. I think she was doing hers on The Beatles. Ryan Cartwright was around and I kept re-meeting him (Run Lola Run, Sliding Doors kind of thing). Ezra and I were somewhere and there were snakes and I think Ezra got stung by a bee. There were these jumpers lying around. Someone said to someone else that the presentation should be about ideas rather than singing a song. Some girl asked me what songs The Beatles were singing. There was some voting thing.
