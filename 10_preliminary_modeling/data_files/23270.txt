I was with a group of people outside some building at night.  We had been batting a ball or some other object in the air like an informal volleyball game, and I continued doing that with some kids that were playing around there while the others hung around and talked.  Suddenly I noticed that the adults had gotten into a car and were leaving.  I asked if I could go with them; it was OK with them, but the car was really crowded already.  Fortunately it was only a short way behind the building that they were going, so I was able to walk there and meet them.  They began to set up camp: we were in the army and were going to launch a field problem from there the next morning.  I asked the guy who seemed to be in charge when reveille was, and he didn't give me a straight answer.  I believe he said "they" would announce it when they got there.  He also made some observation about it getting light 35 minutes earlier in my hometown; I wasn't sure of its relevance.  By way of clarification, I asked him it reveille would be about 3:00, and he said that was about right, but wasn't sure.  I asked him if there was going to be an inspection of rifles.  He said he would do the inspection.  I didn't know where my rifle was, nor did I remember how to get it ready for inspection.  I asked him about brass, and he said we wouldn't be wearing brass because it was a field problem.  I felt embarrassed about having asked him.  Kind of to save face, I asked him about belt buckles, because I knew we would be wearing those.  He didn't answer.
