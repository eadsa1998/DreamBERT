I was just about to enter my sociology class when I saw a few girls (unknown to me) seated at a table across the hall. I, too, sat down there. Then my instructor came and began talking to the girls. I thought that if I kept silent, he wouldn't notice I didn't belong and my presence would do no harm. He then passed out papers for the girls to sign. Since I was no part of the project or whatever it was, I decided it was time to leave. I didn't want to sign something and later get into trouble.
