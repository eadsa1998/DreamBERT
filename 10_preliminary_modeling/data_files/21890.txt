Carl Fisher and I were waiting in the car for a motel room. The young girl who was renting them was walking around our car and hinting what she would like to do, but had no time for it. My penis was erect and I had my hand on it because Carl was feeling for it to see if it was erect. We drove around the motel on the other side and the proprietor said, "You are parking on Grania's property and furthermore, I will not let you have a room because I don't rent to killers." He thought Carl had killed a man, so he would not rent us a motel. I explained to him that he was wrong about Carl because Carl had a hard time killing a fly and someone had spread a wrong rumor. The proprietor then became very friendly. Carl took out some pork chops and fried them very slightly and they had a feast, but I would not eat any because they were practically raw. Denny Carter drove his dad's car to PA and back and said the gas was leaking.
