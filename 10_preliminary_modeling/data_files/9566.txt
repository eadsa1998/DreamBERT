I am walking outside a building and patio. I see water oozing out through moss-covered rocks. See Father Andrew come out and I talk to him. I say something about building needs repair; he comes closer and takes me by the waist and we lie together on the green. He says: I didn't like the tone you used. Did you sign the complaint petition by the building committee?" I say "No, you know I didn't." Then we lie in silence. Ecstasy. Then go to see Pope John and he invites Father Andrew whom I introduce! He lies on a rug and listens to music and Father Andrew is reading silently. Then he bows and kisses the Pope's ring and they begin a discussion. I leave.
