There were another lot of external hard drives. It was the 23rd of whatever month it was. Mom asked me when I was going to study and I said my first exam wasn't for ages. She said it was in a couple of days. I went to check and the accounting exam was on today. It was 8.20-30am and it started at 9.20am. I went to her place and it was her old house. I ran upstairs and got changed and got my calculator and stuff. Darren was asleep on their bed. I went to the kitchen and there wasn't much food. I grabbed a muesli bar and went back down. Ezra said it was too late and it was nearly 9.30, though the clock said 10.18 (it was an hour fast). I fell to my knees and cried and was crying out that I was going to get like 5% average and that I'd be lucky if I got a TER of 1. They ignored me and commented on the neighbour's lawn.
