 I'm in a fishing boat with my brother Wally and sister Heather. Wally is using my friend Kevin Simpson's telescoping fishing rod. He thinks he has a snag. I pull up a huge catfish! Heather nets it. They throw it back right away. I wanted to hold it. There is a huge wooden pirate-type ship. I am on it.
