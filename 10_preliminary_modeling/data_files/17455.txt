There was an organ in the kitchen.  It was light-colored, under the light switch where the china cabinet is.  It was playing by itself.  My mother said it was a recording of my brother Stuart at practice when he was little.  The teacher could be heard with an Italian accent.  I was talking to my mother and my father was anxious to go.  He mentioned the champagne.  They were going to a fancy dinner.
