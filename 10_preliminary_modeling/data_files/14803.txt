I was in the car with Dad and Ezra. Ezra was driving. We had just come from McDonald's and I had a McChicken. We were going around a cliff and the wheel got stuck and wobbled and the car went over the side into the water. It was a convertible and I had no seatbelt on and I fell off. I got to the shore and ended up falling asleep on a bench.
