I took an elevator down. Freaks and Geeks was on a TV. Jason Segel was standing next to me. We joked about my favourite character being Nick. Then I was at some place at night. I was with Neil Patrick Harris and Mom. I saw three guys with what looked like guns. I told Neil and said to run. We ran around some bushes and some of the guys came to cut us off. I heard Mom yell out from there.
