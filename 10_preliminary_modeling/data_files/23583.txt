My friend Emma is talking and showing me a photo of a man. He is wearing a leather jacket and has a long mustache. We're down in a damp-type cave. I tell her that his name isn't John but Mark. She insists his name is John. I know him from somewhere but I can't recall. Something about a wedding gift.
