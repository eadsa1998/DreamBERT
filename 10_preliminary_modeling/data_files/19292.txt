Me and a bunch of my church friends were at an ice rink (outdoors) except it was pretty melted so we are standing in about two inches of water. All of a sudden lightening struck the rink and a surge of energy (little sparks) started going around the rink and we had to jump over it so we wouldn't get electrocuted. Now I am deathly afraid of electricity so this was kind of a scary dream. Anyway, I was trying to get out so I climbed over the fence, being sure to only touch the metal when the electricity ball was on the other side of the rink. Once I got out, I noticed everyone else had gone out the entrance (opening in fence). Everyone was OK.
