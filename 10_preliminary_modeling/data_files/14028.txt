I was in my room on my computer and I had read a magazine earlier that had posters of Martin Sheen from Apocalypse Now, Jensen Ackles and a picture of James Spader. I showed Ezra the pictures of Jensen and Martin. I was typing something personal later on the computer and Ezra came in and I was trying to hide it and get rid of him. I had downloads going too. He wouldn't leave. We both left the room at the same time. There were no water bottles in the fridge and I complained. Ezra left a cup of orange juice on my desk and I ran to his room and poured it on the floor. I realized he'd be angry and ran out. He stormed out angrily and was coming towards me.
