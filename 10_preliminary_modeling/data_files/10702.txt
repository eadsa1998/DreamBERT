I had a dream inside of a dream. People were walking. Then my dad was walking, wearing a yellow muumuu. I started to touch him to see if he was real. He seemed solid--then transparent--it was his spirit. I hugged him and felt happy. He said he was at peace and he loves me. There was a radiance about him. I could feel his energy.
