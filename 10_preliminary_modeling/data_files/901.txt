I am being challenged, by myself really. Someone has made a comment that they can do something, play crosses and foxes and I wonder if I can do it as well or better. I am encouraged by cousin Terence/Dwight to try. I have a self-defeating negative outlook. "No, I can't do that," but my interest is piqued, so I go upstairs to try. I see a board on the wall. A man gives me a chalk and explains the rules. I can't make a mark where something is crossed and he points out 2 places. Some people come by and irrelevantly chat with me. I yak back. I am partly sure I can do this and partly sure I can't. They (the crowd) are annoying as they distract me. I close them out of my mind and the timing starts. I look at the marking on the board for what seems a long time (see drawing in dream book). The crowd gets tense because I'm wasting valuable time but I know that I'm looking at the whole picture to do better. Then as I've seen all I need, I say, "Aha!," and start making X's and O's. The crowd goes, "Ooh!," because every move is right. There is excitement and tenseness. Near the bottom, there are squiggly lines where I'm not supposed to mark but I see 2 places that were difficult and no one else noticed and mark. This time I draw an outline of a rabbit for my X. Times up. I get 7. That ties me with my cousin Terence/Dwight. He's good. The man who is really good says, "Hum, she's got more white light than me even," and is impressed. I am aware that I'm talking despairingly of my talents. I am an observer and I don't like her eyes. They are too large and cow-like. I say to her/me, "Don't talk negatively and put yourself down. You're good," (It was like a challenge in a pool game). Counseling or working with people had something to do with it.
