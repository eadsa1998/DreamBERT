I was walking late one evening up Main Street (in Akron) looking in the store windows. I remember stopping and looking in the store windows several times. One time I stopped and looked at a large figurine -- a black china negro which had fallen face down in a dime store window display. The next window in front of which I stopped contained a large double bed all made with bedspread and all. The unusual feature was the presence of several life-size toy cocker spaniels all over the bed all lying down with faces toward the street. I continued on my way up the street desiring to take in a movie. I remember standing in a long line for a ticket and when I got inside I saw that the place was quite crowded and the feature hadn't started yet. I didn't stop walking, but walked right back outside and ran across the street to another theatre. The cashier girl was closing the office and wasn't going to sell me a ticket at first, but decided she didn't have anything to lose so I went into the movie. The theatre was strangely arranged. It was very, very narrow, drapes were hanging everywhere and the floor was terribly warped. Many persons showed their disgust for my interruption, but I sat, very uncomfortably in the crooked seat on a slant with the floor.
