My online friend from Israel, Mika came to visit.  She's a pretty girl.  Dark hair, bright eyes.  The idea was that we'd spend some time together, and then I'd leave her with my good online friend Del.  I liked the prospect of seeing Del again, too, of course.  Mika and I went window-shopping.  She told me that shampoo was a big thing in Israel.  We saw some packets.  She'd wanted some for graduation.  I washed my hair.  Someone wanted dress shirts, and I helped him get one out.  The sales lady was not nice.  Then I was playing baseball with 3 other people- 2 girls and a guy.  The field was too small, so we were going to move to a real diamond.  A group came and took the first one, second already used, so we went to the smaller, run-down third.  It was hard to play with that few of people.  It got even harder when a group came and dropped their junk down in the line to first base.  We started moving their stuff over.  I picked up a violin.  It had no bow, so I started to pluck, but the strings were very loose.  They only had fine tuners at the bottom, rather than anything at the top.  And there were maybe 8 strings, not four, in reverse order.  I asked a lady about it.  It was special made.  I tried tuning it a little, and tightening the strings so I could play.  I looked again, and there was a string running diagonal across the front and other strings, with no tuner.  I thought that was odd.
