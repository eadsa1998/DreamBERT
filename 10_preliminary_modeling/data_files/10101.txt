It is WINTER and we were stuck in the snow in a toboggan; I see Frank with an Aran knitted cap and don't recognize him when he returns late from the airport; much noise and confusion. A PLAY in which a beautiful woman first puts on a black face and then plays a white woman. I get a part in the play but I miss my cue and muff my lines. I see a basket with coal chips and a lighted case with a Madonna doll -- very lovely.
