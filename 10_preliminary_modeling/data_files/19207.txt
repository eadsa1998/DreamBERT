I was by myself walking down a long, long highway toward a Piggly Wiggly grocery store. I was going to the store for some particular reason. To cash a check or to go to work or something like that. There was a mine of some sort involved for a while. Some type of a coal, steel, some sort of mine. I can't recall what was happening at the mine or why it was even there. It was owned by someone. There were a lot of things that were owned by someone. Just as these grocery stores were. This person owned just about everything that I saw.
