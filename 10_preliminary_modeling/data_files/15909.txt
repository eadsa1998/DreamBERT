I was with Nana and someone else looking at a house they were thinking about buying. It was old and strange but they 'liked its quirk'. The main 'bedroom' was in the middle of the main hall and you had to climb up this very narrow and tall set of stairs. And it wasn't a bedroom, but a king size bed at the top, with cupboards down the side. We walked to the top and Nana realised that Poppa wouldn't be able to climb up. I tried to get down but it was hard. I had to use this ribbon to hold on to the side and then swing back around to the steps. Walking down the steps was scary as well because they were so narrow and steep. There was another guy involved who wanted to change parts of it. There were religious pictures and things all around and he wanted to remove them and was saying he doesn't understand why they don't want what he was suggesting and I said 'maybe they're religious?'. Some time later I was outside and a group of us were sneaking towards another group. It was like a war? A girl came behind this truck and saw us and I quickly grabbed her and put my arm around her throat and she passed out and I put her in the truck. Another girl saw and I did the same thing but less clumsily. I said to one of my teammates 'I've never done that in real life before'. They ended up seeing us and took their guns out and slowly made their way over to us. I said I didn't have a gun and someone threw me one. But it was hard to aim with and I never got a shot. A guy was close and I shot and a dart looking thing with a round green bit on the end hit him in the back and I was like 'I got one!' but someone said it was theirs and showed me the pattern on their dart and it matched. The 'bad guys' were then led by the guy who wanted to change the house and I said 'why don't we talk about this instead of killing each other?' and then I went and sat down and he agreed and they put their guns down.
