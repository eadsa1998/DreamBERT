Someone had a goat nose meal. Darren and Mom had a dinner roll. I was watching an episode of The Outer Limits, there was a Santa woman and me in a building, in the elevator. Someone shouted and I ran. Then I or someone was on the roof, looking down at the roofs of other houses. Whoever it was jumped off the building, but they missed the ground and hit a roof. Calvin and Samantha and someone called Ken Elger were at school. Evelyn had a paper assignment.
