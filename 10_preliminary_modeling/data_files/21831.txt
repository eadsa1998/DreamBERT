I was outside and Frank from Dill's said the best horse in the country or world now was by the name of State. He was not sure of the other part of the name or knew it. I was sitting in a car with a fellow. I looked at the entries, but it was dark and I couldn't see them. I went into the house and Andy P. was there. He was getting ready to go to work. I looked at the clock and it was 15 to 7 am. I said, "You will be late. You can't make it." He said, "I know it." I was walking along and a nice young hillbilly girl smiled at me and asked me if I would walk with her. I said, "That would be a pleasure." So I walked with her. She seemed to be afraid of someone. She stopped in a store and bought a soft drink. I waited for her. A little girl came up to me and said, "Now you can scram." I said, "Now that is not very nice to say. I didn't ask the girl for a walk. She asked me." There was something of smiles. I saw it on other people or I was doing it. I'm not clear on it now.
