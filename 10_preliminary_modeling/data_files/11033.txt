A young couple, friends of mine, were getting married. (I recognize neither of them.) After the wedding, they were fooling around downstairs, with a whole gang of kids surrounding them. Some girl piped up with a cute crack and the groom said: see, I told you what a doll she is (referring to the bride). Later on, they went to bed in my brother's bedroom. Mother suggested various things she ought to do for them. I said she should just leave them alone. She said she had taken care of many couples in that room, and she knew what was best. I still insisted she should just let them alone.
