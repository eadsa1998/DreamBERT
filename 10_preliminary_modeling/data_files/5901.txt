I am walking down a New York City street. Day is sunny and hot. Have to wait for traffic at a cross street and a taxi crosses in front of me. It is yellow and has its door on driver's side all the way open and bent forward and tied down. This leaves the driver fully exposed. He is about 45, thin and disheveled and looks at me with a bored expression as he drives in front. The door, unfortunately, extends out in front of cab and thus is quite dangerous. This annoys me and I want to shout something at the driver. But I don't and I continue walking down the street.
