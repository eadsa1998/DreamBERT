I am at some bar with a couple of friends (male) and we are playing pool and drinking beer. Watching us play is a guy about my size with dark hair that I do not recognize. I miss a shot of something and he says something to me under his breath. Without saying a word, I basically just walk over to him and sock him in the face. I keep hitting him in the face and head and he doesn't really fight back too much. A huge brawl breaks out and people are fighting everywhere. I grab another guy and I hit him in the face over and over. He fights back, but I am in a rage and I am moving too fast for him. After he goes down, I find another person to fight. I chase him around the bar and I find him hiding under table. I pull him out and punch him just like I did to the others. I wake up suddenly in a hot sweat, and the dream seems amazingly vivid and real to me.
