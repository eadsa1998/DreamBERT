I am in the center of town, and I'm about to walk home. However, there is a group of 5 or 10 kids hanging around the corner, and as soon as I catch up to them I see that we're about to be forced to go somewhere in a vehicle that looks a bit like an ambulance, but I get a feeling it's the police. I realize maybe I shouldn't have gone over there, but I'm still curious to know what's going on. Just in case we're being arrested, I demand to know what we're being taken in for. A man says we'll find out soon enough. The next part of the dream is fuzzy, but then I remember being in my house, in the den with the lights off while my brother and his friends are in the living room. Something makes me lucid for a moment, to some extent, and I decide there's no reason to stay in the house, so I go out the back door. Then I'm blank- I'm not sure if I just woke up, or lost lucidity, or what exactly happened, but the next thing I remember someone's (my mother?) telling me Ms. L. has died. I can't believe this, and for some reason it actually feels strange, and eerie, that I had seen her not too long ago. I think it was a car accident. I really can't believe it, and want to check the newspaper or the internet to make sure this is really going on.
