The little boy was so interested in the mailbox that I said, "Let's look in and see what grandfather has." One fragile article in can with yellow corn kernels inside so as to retain heat. I hurried to show child the can. He was at dinner and I walked over the white tablecloth to him but the kernels had become detached and the can was half full of corn. My slippers had left dirty footprints on the cloth and I tried to rub them off with little success but the shape was no longer recognizable as footprints. Now we must do chores. L. starts dishes and I the beds but L. comes and says, "I'll do that, just fold the blankets and put sheets in the laundry." I help fold blankets and take my pillow. Am uneasy lest they know I innocently slept with J. He had been on a two-night visit. ... We start to see the ball game. My bench was almost filled with children. The other time benches had been pulled over. A girl was batting. They were using paper plates as bats.
