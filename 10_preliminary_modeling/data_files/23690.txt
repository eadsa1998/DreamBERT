I dream about my middle sister's baby, its name is David.  [In reality she doe not have any children.]  My middle sister is sad about being pregnant.  But it definitely changes her, makes her stronger, more mature.  I don't know who the father is.  Mom cooks 15 turkeys - ovens all over the whole wall - pumpkin pies, Thanksgiving.  Telling someone about the time I had to go outside to turn off a light - being scared.  Good feelings in all parts of this dream.  Male friends (I don't recognize them) coming by, or I meet them.  Or male friends are there for Thanksgiving - good feelings about this. Making love with a guy, telling my pregnant sister so she can decide to leave the room.  Hazy:  Deciding to get in my car and go to Northern Arizona, Petrified Forest, or Hovenweep?  Or to school?  Looking at baby - its eyes, its smile, not picking it up but thinking about it.  (Why don't I pick it up?  I want to, but don't.)  Baby's eyes moving - first they're close-set, then wider apart.  Pregnant sister is about to go on a trip - She's planning on delivering baby while on trip.  When we protest she acts like - what can I do?  ( I think she won the trip.)  She feels she has to follow through with the trip.
