I was fixing some kind of cart. It had single wheels on it so I was going to put on double wheels. It would run better. I picked out a horse to win and he won. The next time the one that ran 2nd I picked he won the next time he ran. I can't recall the names now. I was changing my clothes in the shop. We were going to have a party. Charley Charvat was with us. I noticed I had on a pair of red woolen long hunting socks. I put on my suit. It seemed my pants were too long. I looked into the mirror and I was fat or stout. My waistline was about fifty inches. I was really fat.
