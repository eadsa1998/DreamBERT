I went on the forum and it was different. Someone had made a joke about Benjamin and I being married. Arnie had left and had closed his account because Facebook was screwing up too much (they were combined somehow). I asked Benjamin about it. Then in real life, Benjamin and I were in a big, old house with no windows (like post-apocalyptic like). We each had a gun and heard a noise and we were sneaking around trying to hide. There were 3 girls and a guy and then we saw more, so we gave up. Later, Benjamin and I were in bed which was just a mattress on the floor. Then it wasn't us and this guy kissed her shoulder and she pushed him away. He did it again and she didn't resist. She then blurted out that she wasn't a virgin, using some word like 'skag''.
