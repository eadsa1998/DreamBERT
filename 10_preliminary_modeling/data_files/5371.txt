I had this dream that Mrs. Carter and I were sitting on these chairs that were in the clouds and tilted all over the place. Then my family and I all lived in some great big mansion and that obnoxious group of girls in my grade was being really annoying. I had to cut Kim's hair, but her hair was such a mess, and I was frustrated trying to work with it. I turned off the lights and left.
