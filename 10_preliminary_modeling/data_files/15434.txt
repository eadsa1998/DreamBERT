There were a group of British guys (they may have been brothers) who were around 25, and were trying to find wives. One girl agreed to marry one of them, after she had decided she would never find love. One of the girls was called Izzy and had been with the guy for 4 years. Ezra watched It's A Wonderful Life and wanted to stay in a hotel room that James Stewart stayed in. Darren organized it. I was then at work. I accidentally put a metal plate in the microwave (the boss had called for me, and I had quickly put it in there) and I was like 'I'm an idiot!'. I said that I'd only done it once before; the first time I used a microwave and I didn't know you couldn't put metal in there.
