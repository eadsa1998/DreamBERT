I am in a place which is my old school, but I am there to attend my university classes. I go up to the appropriate classroom and when I sit at my desk, I remember the Psychology test I have tomorrow. I get out together with another boy -- I don't know who he is. On the way I buy some bread because I am hungry. We go over to the gym and I talk to him about a fight I had with another guy when I was in school. Now we don't greet each other. We return the same way and I buy some more bread. I am hungry.
