A childhood friend who is gay sends me a clipping from a big city newspaper congratulating me on winning a contest for my house plans. He saw it because he said he has a sister who is a model and she was in the same newspaper. My husband and I stop to visit this friend and my husband remarks about him being a "fudge packer" (gay). I am embarrassed and pretend I don't hear but everyone knows I did. Things are uncomfortable and we leave. I apologize for my husband. The apology is not accepted. The friend's sister is in the house doing dishes and she is big and not pretty and doesn't look at all like a model. The house is in my hometown in the area where the friend actually lived. It is difficult to get to, especially in winter, because of the hills.
