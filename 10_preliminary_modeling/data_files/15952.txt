I was at a shop and I'd had a drink with some people and I was driving out and got stopped by a policewoman who gave me a breath test. She went off to test it and I was holding up traffic, so I drove further around the corner to where she was parked. She went to the next car to test them and I continued waiting. I saw Esther and some other people from work and I waved. I asked what store they did but I don't remember what they said. The policewoman came back and said I was ok to go and my reading had been '0.5', which was well below the limit. Later I was in Ms Nowak's class for today and she said she'd made a mistake with the director's presentations and that those of us remaining had to do this other activity. She showed us these drawings and they were like coloured in with pens, using lines. So it was drawing a scene or picture using only certain defining lines (like a window, but not a desk) and then using 'lines' to colour it in. I had no idea what she wanted us to do and so I just sat there.
