["Swimming in the river pool."] I am traveling down a long series of halls, apparently in a school, like a university. I am going to the underground swimming pool where the water is actually a river. I see there are hardly any posters or decorations on these walls. I see to the right deep green water reflecting from the river. Then I enter the swimming pool area. It is huge and square. It's time to do laps. The male coach is watching. I get in the water and swim long strong strokes. At first I am holding my arms in a bit, not doing the strokes full strength or in the right position. Then I get stronger and the strokes longer and more correctly positioned. I swim up the long right side, turn the corner and swim across the top and so on, swimming in a square, along the edges of the pool. The coach is impressed with my prowess. I feel strong and capable. It's like swimming in circles in a square. Or swimming a square circle.
