I am in the very roomy back seat of a chauffeur-driven limo that Nate and Cate Evers own. We are just driving around and Cate is talking about feeling depressed, even tough she has everything. I talk to her like a counselor, saying, "I know you know all this, being counselors yourself, but the problem is..." and I go on. Nate shows me a poster he made with a series of pictures of children crying. One is crying so hard she looks like she is beaming a laughing smile. Nate says, "She's finally taking a breath." I agree that is hard to observe, the child crying so hard they don't breathe. I notice the area behind the back seat is a huge room like a trailer house. I go back to explore a bit. I notice the chauffeur is in a black uniform. He's male and a bit overweight and large. The steering wheel is in the center of this long roomy front seat. Now we get out and go right into a building where some religious women are training the children. They turn them upside down and spank them harshly. The children are crying and crying. I am appalled and say to her angrily, "This is abuse. What are you doing?" The woman says they are training the children. I say, "You sure are...training them to be docile and to accept whatever you give them spiritually as the truth. This is shocking." I turn and go out to the front porch and as I leave, I turn and say to her, "When we die, I will go to heaven and you will go to hell." She sneers and says, "You have no hell" (meaning no religious beliefs that are real, like theirs).
