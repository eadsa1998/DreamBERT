["Flying, Aliens and a manual wheelchair."] I I am in a mechanics shop because my van is broken. I am waiting a long time and the owners seem to be watching me very closely, but from a distance. It makes me nervous. I pace up and down, pretending to exercise, but really trying to keep an eye on these strange people. Finally, after many hours, I am now waiting in their living room. The boys are in there too and they watch me suspiciously. I notice I am now in a manual wheelchair and I pop a wheelie, balancing on the back wheels. This impresses the boys very much. I seem to have gained some power by impressing them. I keep doing it. Now the living room furniture has been removed and the boys are setting up a game for a contest. Three large tin cans are piled one on two to form a pyramid. A long line of these clusters of cans go down the center of the room. I am now in another room where a TV screen is in the wall and is playing Star Wars. A food table is set up. These strange boys are watching me. I begin to wonder if they are aliens. I get worried and nervous. I find a moment when they are not looking and sneak out and down the stairs to the shop. I look for my van and finally find it. It is all changed and I get in. The aliens are on to me and I must hurry. I am excited and a bit scared. I try the key and am able to get it going. The faster I go, the more the van rises up in the air. I am flying. The aliens are in pursuit. I have to work hard to keep the van above the tree line. I look ahead and see a mountain range. I keep forcing the van higher and make it over the mountains successfully. I call in to a small town airport and tell them I know this is strange, but I am flying a van and don't know how to land it. They give me instructions and I made it in safely.
