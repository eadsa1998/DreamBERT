I was at school, which was different, and it was graduation night. It was an undercover area. Ms Braun started singing and dancing to Tongue Tied, so I joined in doing the movements too. I had to sign a sheet to allow it to be released afterwards (it was being recorded). Eugene was there and looked really upset/angry. I was sitting on a lounge near him and wanted to take photos but he kept moving. Darius was on a chair. Ezra grabbed Darius's shoe and threw it and he just sat there. I got it and threw it back over. Mom and Darren got there and I wasn't in the right clothes so told Mom we had to go now and I ran really fast through this grassed area. I saw Elijah. Fly was playing "I want to get away, I want to fly away" and I thought it was fitting. I still hadn't got pants or shoes. It was 6.43pm and it started at 7pm and I wasn't ready. There were chairs on the stage and I helped to arrange them. Evelyn asked me about the funny stuff I'd written down in class and if it was in my diary and I said no. I was worried her parents would see her talking to me. Mom had called some teacher guy about how I was going in Biology and I wasn't doing well. I said it was because one of the assignments was for me to watch Red Dwarf and I loved it. Mom said it was average and I said it was hilarious. Then at school there was a Red Dwarf section. There was a picture of Rimmer with a big mouth and a story about Lister. Boys and girls had to all go into the same toilet. I was waiting outside but had to go in and some people were naked and I was grossed out. I had to go to the toilet but the cubicles were all open ones so I didn't go. We were in the carpark. Mom asked if I knew the guy I like's car and I said "Yeah, and he's here with his mother, father (Abraham) and brother (Rodney)" and Mom asked "sister?" and I said he didn't have one. I saw Eugene's car on the other side of the carpark.
