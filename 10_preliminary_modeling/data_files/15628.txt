I was at school and had classes in different suburbs. I had one in Como. Then they all just at the same school and I was looking through my phone to find my next one which turned out to be discrete math. Vikram was also in my class. The desks were all close together and Vikram and I sat next to each other. Eugene was in front of me and Jeremiah sat on the other side of Vikram. As soon as the teacher started talking I got bored. A black friend of mine had to do some test. We weren't allowed to do have drugs or weapons and she gave me her lighter and cigarettes beforehand. My pockets were bulging. The packet of cigarettes had a picture of a section of the eastern part of the country highlighted with 'Bob Geldof' written there and a pic of him in the top right. Then Bob Geldof was with me and said to me 'I wanted to see what kind he smoked and if it's one of mine'. I said my pockets were full of smoke and he said 'and you won't ever smoke them' and I said 'I won't'. My friend finally joined us. Bob said he was addicted to cigarettes. I said I'm addicted to chocolate. I said I loved chocolate fingers and said they were so delicious I ate an entire pack in one day. Then I was in a big room with lots of people. Kevin Spacey and Chris Barrie were there. I tried to get a picture of them with Bob. I walked through a shop and looked at puppies.
