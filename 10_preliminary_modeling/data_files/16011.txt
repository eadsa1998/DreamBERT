I was in an elevator and when it opened the lights were flickering and it looked like a creepy hospital. I thought it had to be a dream and could see something convulsing just around the corner. I went to flick the light switch to check if it was a dream and then the convulsing thing was Tristan and he looked up at me but his features all started melting into his face so it looked like he had no face. I was scared and was like 'definitely a dream' and said 'no I don't like this' and he started coming towards me and I shut my eyes and tried to breathe and wake myself up, which I did.
