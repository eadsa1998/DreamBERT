I was in a truck with someone and there was a billboard with a development plan around a lake with different shapes of colors and names on the colors. One name said "Fingers" and someone said he wouldn't sell out. Then there was a model on the ground of the trees around me and a guy started to cut the model trees down and then the real trees started to fall. Then the truck I was in started to turn over backwards a few times -- slow and mechanical feeling. When it stopped, it began to go forward turning over but then my son was in the truck and we were falling around and I was truing to put him in his car seat.
