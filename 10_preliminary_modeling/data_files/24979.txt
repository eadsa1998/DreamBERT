 I'm driving back from a long trip. I get into the Metropolis, and realize I missed my exit. I was daydreaming about a trip with my girlfriend, Annie Thomas. Than I'm driving my truck backwards on the freeway and there is a semi-truck driving backwards too. I pull over to the side of the freeway to turn around and go straight. I do, and when traffic is clear enough for me to go, I see a buffalo grazing near the side of the freeway. I am on a motorcycle. As I get closer to the buffalo it turns into a minotaur. I stop. I'm scared. The minotaur crushes the front of my motorcycle. I get off and run to the side of the road. It picks up the motorcycle and throws it a long way.
