I overhear her who is sitting between others a little further along on the wall telling of her plans for a trip. I asked J. if I heard her all right. J. says I did and continues re: her plans. The mailman comes and mother takes a large parcel from him. At first I think it's a letter for M. and why is mother opening it, but it is the large package whose condition she's examining. It is J's bed cover. I think it's big enough for a mattress. Mother asks me, "If J. is going, you come and sleep with the little boys, you won't mind will you?" I say, "but I do mind. The boys are too old now." "Where were you sleeping, J.?" "In the attic, it's pretty cold up there."
