Sandy L called me. She is telling me about some of the things going on at the office, as though SXDS is still around and the office still there. She is working for the regional office. I'm very surprised by some of the things she is telling me. I say, "You're kidding?" Then she suggests we get together for lunch so she can tell me everything. I agree and ask her what day she has in mind. We're both looking at her calendars and she suggests the coming Sunday. I tell her that won't work for me. I see her look at me like she doesn't believe me. I don't know how this is possible since we're talking by phone. She finally asks me why not and I just say I have another commitment. I don't really. I just don't want to have lunch with her on a Sunday. She seems annoyed and doesn't suggest anything else. I see that I really do have appointments every day that coming week. I tell her we could do Monday but it would be a late lunch. We could Tuesday but I only have an hour in-between appointments. On Wednesday I have several hours open around lunch time. She finally agrees to Wednesday.
