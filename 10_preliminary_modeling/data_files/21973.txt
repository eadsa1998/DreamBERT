I was in a stream of water. A lady was anchoring her boat. She got a push from us and it started. I hung on the back of the motor boat and she was piloting the boat up a stream. There were big waves from a fast big boat that came by and she was afraid of them. We came to a shallow part of the stream. I gave her a push when the boat was dragging or touching. Finally she got over it. I had to climb over a little bank or hill in the water and found some hooks. I threw one in and the lady near the beach said she got one in her foot yesterday. My sister Sue was talking to me or was home and I seemed to be bawling her out about lying.
