I was getting married to Eugene. I had reluctantly decided to have a wedding. It was in 2 days and we were getting ready for it. I was wearing a wedding dress and I decided I looked too fat and refused to wear it. I wanted to see Eugene in his tuxedo, but was thinking of asking him if we could do a casual wedding. We were spending this time apart. I packed up my room, which was different, to be left for a day or two. Mom was helping me.
