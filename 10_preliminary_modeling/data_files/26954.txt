 I'm in a suburb hunting deer with a bow with three other people. I get three plastic or rubber-tipped arrows. There are many other hunters around. A buck runs by. Hunters release a flurry of arrows, none of them hitting the deer. It doubles back and goes in front of me I shoot, and my arrow bounces off the side of the deer, completely ineffective. The deer turns into a man. I run and hide in the pit room at home. My friend Hank Anderson is looking for me. He is coming from my neighbor Alvin Broud's house. He enters the pit room and finds me. I'm having sex with my classmate Megan Cunningham when he enters.
