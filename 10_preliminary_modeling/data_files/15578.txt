I was living in London. There was some David Cronenberg thing happening at Benjamin's university, so I went up to Edinburgh to see it. I was sitting on the floor between chairs and Benjamin came out and saw me, but ignored me ad talked to this other guy. Then we got sent out as it was not on or had changed the time. I went back and people were posting about what they were watching and it was now on and I was sad that Benjamin didn't speak to me at all.
