I dreamed that I had gone fishing on a Saturday with a friend from the university (George L.) to Puerto Viejo, which is to the south of Pucusana, about 50 miles south of Lima. In this picnic or camping trip we were accompanied by two secretaries from the university named Hilda and Heidi. Since we arrived at dusk, we put up two tents and the secretaries fixed us something to eat. Later on at night we put out the fishing nets and after finishing the work, we went to rest. I was talking to Heidi and asked her if she was cold, and she told me she was, and then I went close to her to keep her warm and we kept talking until I decided to kiss her, after having asked her if I could. Later on Heidi and I got into the tent and I kept caressing her until we had intercourse, though she didn't want to at the beginning. Later on she realized that I could make her happy. I didn't remember any more. My friend was somewhere else with the other girl.
