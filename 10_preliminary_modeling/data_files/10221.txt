Long dream of a car trip to TEXAS with WALLY and one of his friends and a pretty young woman; the other boy is able to make love to her, but Wally wanders off absentmindedly. shift: we have to make a second trip to Texas, because we have too much baggage; we stop to eat with Frank's sister and her husband; I am bored; we have to do dishes, and go sight seeing and return home.
