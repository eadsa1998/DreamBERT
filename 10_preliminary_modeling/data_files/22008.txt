Someone knocked on the side door. I answered it and a man was there. He started to talk about horses and I didn't want my wife to hear, so I said, "Get away from here." He was saying or naming horses, giving the odds and the date, then it dawned on me, so I said, "Come here," and I looked behind the door and it was a woman now and I remember shoot or shot was one of the horses, so I asked her what was the name of the horse and what was the odds. But she wouldn't answer the question because I would not listen to her before.
