I had a meeting with Al H and quite a few other people at WDF. In front of this group of my peers he asked me to go make copies. I confronted him and got irate that he chose me, a doctoral student, to go make copies for him. It was a huge stack of papers and most of them were two sided. Al H came up to me and started yelling at me for confronting him but then stormed away back to the meeting. After the incident with Al H I thought about calling Deb U and asking her to say something to him about how inappropriate it was for him to ask me to run copies. When I ran out of paper I debated whether I should go to him and ask for money to go purchase paper to finish making the copies or if I could just order some and wait for it to get there to finish making the copies. It was a huge stack of papers that I was making copies of. Instead of asking Al H for money, I was going all over looking for more paper. When I was doing this I seemed to be at the DDSI office. I found some labels that were clear with red print on them. Some of them were labels of my name. I thought it was curious that they still had labels with my name on them in the office.
