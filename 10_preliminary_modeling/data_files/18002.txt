My family and I were at a (birthday?) party for one of my father's coworkers named Lee.  I had my boyfriend sitting on my lap, but I don't think it was Jeremy.  There were people performing.  One woman came up and started mimicking my performance as a bird (which I'd done earlier?).  So I acted like one again and blinked and cocked my head.  Another performer (sort of like Blue Men, face hidden) picked up my left foot and pulled it to the left, then to the right.  My dad and everyone were trying to convince Lee to open his present but he was leery.  Finally he did it was "Dog...yoga...____...____...BARF! sheets", supposed to look like they had barf on them.  It was a redneck joke gift.
