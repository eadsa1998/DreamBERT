When it started we were at some sort of party. All the kids from my class were there, although I didn't see them all. I just knew they were there. All the teachers were there too. I can't remember what went on for a while, but then Steve told Melissa to share what happened to her. She said, "No, that's all right. I don't really have to." Steve and Todd told her she had to. So she told everyone she passed her math exam and everyone applauded. The somehow it was Nina who had told the news, and tears came to her eyes and she went running to the bathroom, and Courtney and I followed. When we got there, she had locked herself in the stall. I said, "Nina, why are you crying? You passed your math exam!" And she said, "Get away from me, you fat, ugly bitch." Anne had also come in the bathroom in time to hear this, and she walked to the stall, unlocked it, and went in. Then Julia went in too. I don't remember what happened, but a lot of the 7th graders came in, including Anna. For some reason we were throwing a tomato around the room and it bounced off Anna's shoulder. She was worried that she'd smashed it, but Nina said, "Don't worry, you're not fat like Hilary." I can't remember what happened after that. I think I woke up, but the dream continued for a minute, then changed. Setting: At my school, and my school bathroom. Characters: Nina &amp; Melissa, two of my best friends. Todd, my math/science teacher. Anne &amp; Julia, two really good friends. Steve, my advisor, head of the school. Courtney, a friend of Anna, my "little sister" (at school, 8th graders get a 7th grade "sibling" to help them adjust to middle school). Feelings and Thoughts: Angry, worried, concern. When Nina said I was a fat, ugly bitch, I was hurt and angry, but I didn't show it. Melissa really did pass her math test, and they told the entire 7th and 8th grades (it was an accomplishment for her because in two years she's never passed a math test, so they wanted to acknowledge her work).
