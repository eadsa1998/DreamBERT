 I'm at my neighbor Alvin Broud's house, in his front yard. I am doing a project with my friend Stephen Ramos, in which I measure the temperature of two kinds of crystals. There is a woman there that gives us some pointers. I urinate in Alvin's back yard, near the alley. I don't think anyone can see me. My neighbor Luke Stalk is doing something outside. He may be pulling the tarp-top onto my other neighbor Gary Stein's yellow car. I see Alvin's dog in a sprinkler in my back yard, across the alley. The sprinkler is weak. The dog trots over when I call him. I am worried about being bitten. The dog seems aloof, like he doesn't recognize me. The temperature in Alvin's house is warm. Stephen says something about turning the heat up to 70 degrees and staying in the house, if we need. I am having sex with my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas. It is kind of imaginary, but kind of real. We have sex hard.
