I went to the toilet at school. It had a little tourism shop and cafe and the toilets had a see through door and a shower. I was told that it was a Year 11 and 12 toilet. I accidentally went back later. I had to climb a ladder to S+E but it was gone.  There was an assembly and people were randomly called up to play music. Calvin and I were moving around.
