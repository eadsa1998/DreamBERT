Walter was in town and I was really excited to see him. We were on the streets of the city and he came walking up out of the blue. He had a blank look on his face. I was saying hello and all but he seemed not to hear. He was walking as if he was a zombie. He grabs Diana by the shoulders as if he is about to embrace her and then starts pushing her backwards. He pushes her out onto the street and into a cab. She is OK but is underneath the cab and Walter walks on. <br/
