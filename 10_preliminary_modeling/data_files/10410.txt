A group from the Book Cafe is leaving for the Retreat Center. We are sitting on a bus and I put my square suitcase underneath my seat, after having checked to see what I had packed in it. I say goobye to Patrick and Margaret and when we arrive at the Retreat Center remember giving someone $18.- change for a $2.- purchase out of a $20.- bill
