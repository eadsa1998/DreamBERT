 I walk by a shelf of food at a grocery store to get a box of some kind of food mix, soup, or something generic. I start a waffle iron and put some shortening on it to grease it. I start to mix up blueberry muffin mix for the waffles. There is a lot of old, rotting cheese on a shelf, which I think is like the Whitman house. I add oil, eggs, and cheese to the mix. There are many generic mixes on the shelf, as well as yellow generic cans of blueberries.
