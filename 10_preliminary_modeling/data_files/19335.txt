I dreamt that I was driving down the road that I live off of. My friend Ryan was in the passenger seat. Neither of us had our license to drive, but it was just us. I was driving the car that I share with my sister. I remember being very worried about being caught by the police. All was going fine. Then we saw a cop pull out from a shop on that street. He followed us, and I went faster. I thought I might be able to outrun him and get home. I pulled into the driveway and the cop was right there. He got out and he said something about something being on the trunk. I opened the trunk and my cat jumped out. Then the cop took Ryan to the police station for some reason. I went inside and then I woke up.
