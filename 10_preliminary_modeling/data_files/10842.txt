I dreamt that I was having extreme pains and didn't know where they were or what was causing them. I made an appointment at a hospital to see a doctor. I went to the hospital and a nurse at the desk took my name and other statistics and then sent me to a room. An intern came in, a young man about 28 and examined me, then told me to lie down. I'd have to wait until the specialist came. I lay there for about an hour, very annoyed because I had to wait, and then the doctor came. He told me I'd have to have an operation, but I said it was impossible. I had to go to school.
