I have to go to the bathroom. I find a stall and sit down on the toilet. I hear lots of water sloshing and smell urine. I realize that I have sat down on a toilet that was full to the brim and dragged my skirts in the urine and water. I attempt to get the skirt out of the water. I try to urinate. It feels like I have a bladder infection. Small quantities come out and it's hard to push. I look over the short stall door and chat with a woman in the next stall. I get up to return to where I was, either counseling or a class, very aware of how I smell of urine. I feel embarrassed but know there isn't much I can do about it. Some guy wants me to counsel him. I am not interested in helping. I notice I have square boxes on my feet. I must have accidentally stepped in them and can't get them off. I see Dylan and ask him to help me. He does, smiling at my predicament in a friendly, teasing way. I slide down the hall, unable to stop easily.
