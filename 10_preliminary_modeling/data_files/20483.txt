Three women about 25 were standing nude on sofas. I studied their mannerisms. One was heavier than the others and seemed more sophisticated in manner. Another was slender and subjective in manner. The third one was light complected (the other two were dark), and she seemed adventurous. The slender one went into a closet in the men's room and dressed into a woolen skirt and a blouse. A fourth woman, younger than the rest, appeared wearing a skirt and blouse. Then the other two got dressed, and they seemed to be relieved to be dressed. (While they had been unclad, I had studied the size and shape of the lips of their vulvas and I tried to see how they reflected the girls' personalities.) Later I was lying on the street outside unclad and a blanket was under me. I was reading a paperback book. The woman who had been with me inside were across the street looking at me. I felt uncomfortable and tried to find my place in the book. On the page someone had written, "drop dead." I recalled that my place was at the spot where the last letter of those words ended. Then a man carrying a book about a foot long and a foot wide and about 10 inches thick was holding the book over the edge of a balcony. He seemed to want it to drop. I reasoned that he may want something to happen to the book so that he would not have to return it to the library. The drop from the balcony was about 30 feet. Then a man came behind him and kicked him down the stairs.
