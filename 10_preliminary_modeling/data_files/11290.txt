I was typing an English theme. As I transferred the rough draft to the final, I threw away the pages of the rough draft one by one into the waste basket as I finished. I became very tired and leaned back to light a cigarette, and somehow the waste basket caught on fire. I took it to the kitchen in order to extinguish the flames with water, and from the charred remains I realized that it was my final, typed draft of the paper which I had destroyed. It was too late to do the work over, and I realized that this would mean a poor grade in the course.
