I had my shoes off, barefooted, and a lady had her bare feet. I had a beautiful shaped foot like the lady. My toes were shaped nice except on the left foot big toe it was bent in from the shoe that caused it. I was sitting and looking and admiring my feet. There was a gang of boys that had pistols. They were going thru the woods and the cops were looking for them. The boys were shooting at each other. I flew up and out of the way of the shooting.
