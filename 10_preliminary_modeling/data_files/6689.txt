We are going to a play at 8 p.m., but want dinner first. We think it's in the same building and go up in the elevator. We see no dining room but open a door and the woman, inside the large room like a private dining room with tables in sight whom we ask the time says it is 6 p.m. and it's time to have photographs of the players taken. I say, "But we have had nothing to eat." She says. "Yes, you had dinner." I am distressed because I can't remember eating and say so.
