My job as a volunteer for this civic organization is to give the children a bag of candy. Then I tell them to hang it up in this one place, and then as they talk to me, someone from behind a curtain behind them takes the candy back. It's supposed to be funny. One boy is hanging on o the bag when the hand comes out to take it and they tussle over it. This happens over and over. The kids are disappointed and sad. Then the job is over and the curtain opens and the volunteers come out to take a bow, with the kids. I wonder if they got their candy after they went behind the curtain. They form two rows to take a bow and I know I'm supposed to join them, but I don't want to. I feel kind of bad about my part in this.
