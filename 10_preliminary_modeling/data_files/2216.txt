I am the only English boy in a Chinese school. They don't like me at all. They are all seated at long tables in rows. I must sit alone at a school desk. I had befriended a Chinese girl who wanted me to sit with her, but the teacher hated me and made me sit alone. So when she wasn't looking, I'd sneak between the tables back to my desk. [BL]
