 I'm at a fair, like the fisherman's picnic. I drive in with my friend Niles Zelling in his car, past where people park. I give Niles a piece of paper, which is like money, but it is worth 11 or 12 dollars. He plays a game with it by crumpling it up and shooting it towards a basketball hoop. He misses. It looks like that 12 dollars was just lost! A police officer sees us and tells us we have to move the car, but we already know this and are doing so. I go into the Red Rooster Shop with my friend Stephen Ramos. He needs money so he divides up the staff tips and takes his share. I look at the merchandise for sale. I find a $5 bill behind a fishing lure, and keep it, quietly. I find two checks written to me from Stephen, which I had left on the shelf a while back. One is for $3.49, and the other for $.49. Stephen is mad at me, which is characteristic of him, because he thinks since I haven't cashed them I'm screwing up the balancing of his checkbook. There are some long thin rectangular stickers there. I leave them there: they are a secret with the guys I am with: Stephen, my coworker Tom Olson, and another man. I wear a red bandana and a gray sweatshirt when we leave in a car. I want to look good.
