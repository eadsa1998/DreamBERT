My wheelchair is broken. I had driven it up to my van and gotten out. Then I saw a midget with no legs and deformed hands go in my chair with her two kids and drive it around. They broke it. I get out and try to find them. I ask a deaf woman for info on where they are. I have to repeat myself, but she understands pretty well. Then I decide I'll drive through the campground until I see them. [BL]
