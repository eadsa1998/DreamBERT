Borat finished downloading, but I kept getting interrupted every time I went to watch it. It was good quality. I was then at a cinema and there was a video shop and a food shop. My shoes got thrown out the window and I asked this shop guy for shoes and socks. I said that I had no money, but he said it didn't matter. I went to the video shop and I was going to ask for a job. This girl had just quit because the manager was sexist or something. I was with that Eric guy from a previous dream who looked just like a young Andrew McCarthy, and we were going out. Borat was playing at the cinema and people were laughing heaps. We were in this other shop lying down under these shelves. There were ants nearby. I said that I had the movie at home and it was also going to be on Foxtel. The movie didn't start until 6pm. Mom was somewhere.
