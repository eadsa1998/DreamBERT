This dream started out in a bar in Boston. I went there with two of my friends. I also bumped into this boy from school who I used to date. My friends and I were out partying because we were going to New York the next day for a vacation. Instead of going to New York we ended up in Arizona. We ended up in a car rental agency. The man was first telling us there were no cars left. Then a car was found for us. I thought it was awesome because we had to travel across the country in order to reach New York. I was excited because I felt independent and knew it was going to be an adventure.
