I was at home, which was different. There was a giant spider and Ezra had it trapped in the aircon and it was hanging outside it. He pulled it off and it looked dead and dropped on top of a kitten called Sarah. Then it grabbed the kitten and went backwards under the lounge. We pulled out the lounge and it moved back and Ezra killed it. The kitten was ok. Then we remembered about this giant snake that was also in the aircon. I went up the hallway and saw some of the aircon vents were bent. One of the rooms had bits broken off and mine were bent inwards. I saw the backdoor open and closed it, but thought nothing of it. Mom and Ezra checked the rooms for the snake. I mentioned the door being open and we went outside to check, but couldn't find it. Then it was a movie and this detective was questioning someone and saw the snake shadow behind them and shot it.
