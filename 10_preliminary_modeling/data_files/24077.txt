I'm walking outside on a sidewalk with Luke and we're passing by the beach. It's really sunny out and Luke points to all the surfers and suggests we go out. I reply that I'm not very good and don't want to. He doesn't ask again and we keep walking. It's nighttime now and we're at the same beach, it seems like, right where the sidewalk ends and the water and waves begin. Luke and Joey go out and come back and say now it's my turn, so I paddle out into the water and I'm all by myself, and my friends are sitting on the sidewalk. I catch my first wave and am really awkward riding it, but I stay up as it begins to die and a new wave in the opposite direction begins to build. And they yell, "Now catch that one!" I ride into the new wave horizontally and start the new wave back toward the sidewalk and am about to land on the sidewalk when a new wave starts again and I catch it going back out. Luke laughs, "He looks so funny in the transition!" And I say, "Whatever, I haven't fallen yet." The waves get tighter and tighter together and it feels like I'm on a skateboard, half pipe, and I begin to catch air. In the middle of this I wake up.
