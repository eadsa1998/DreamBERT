 I'm driving near Naliton and Middleton College. Several Roads are blocked off. We continue to drive north until a road leads east. Going east, we descend a long hill. I feel nauseated. The road turns to a bridge-like structure, a dike a few feet above the water's surface, with bodies of water on both sides of the long, smooth stretch of highway. On the other side of the water is Naliton, which I see to be an old town of dark-colored brick with narrow roads. The road, which is flooded annually, has "steps" up, when we get close to the town. Coming the opposite way, several people on bicycles and motorcycles ride down the steps. In town, we're at a small restaurant. An employee cuts up my leftover steak, from my dinner last night, on a piece of white bread, and heats it in the microwave.
