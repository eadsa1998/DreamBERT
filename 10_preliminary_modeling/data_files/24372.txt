An epic road trip following the plot to a movie. My friend Cassie accused me of losing her camera gear after I had in fact found Kirsten's on the beach and rescued it. She was just upset at herself. This was in a resort town, near the beach. Though the layout reminded me of another beach town.  There were water guns. Getting the jones dr pepper soda. Changing clothes. Fighting with the Russians. Being told I have five days to produce an epic story... and if I do, I get the investigative reporter job. Pitched to me by Karin in the newsroom. The water guns. Talking to the guy native in the resort town. Going into these kids' house for the night. Mostly girls. They like me and we tell them stories of our adventure. My companion is either my brother or a close friend.
