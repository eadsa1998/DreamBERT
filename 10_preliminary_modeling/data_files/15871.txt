I had posted a video of a video Dan Palmer had posted, saying something about him being hot. When I checked the video next, I saw that he had specifically requested it to not be able to see it. I felt really bad and was sad that it'd bothered him so much. When I checked the button to 'ignore' something, you had to say why and one of the options was 'stalking'. I deleted the video and was trying to think of some way to fix things.
