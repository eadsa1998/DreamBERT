We were on stage rehearsing for choir.  We were all of a sudden supposed to memorize the music.  I went down in front and watched through a video camera.  When I did so, luminescent blue beings could be seen inside the others on stage.  They were spirits.  I watched the one on the right, where I stand.  It jerked its head to the side.  It was creepy.  Then we were back stage, standing by the curtain.  A bit further back there was a door, I guess to the control or lighting room.  I saw one of the academic advisors on the phone.  He was getting a warning.  I don't remember if I tried to warn everyone or not.  I sought shelter by the wall under the curtain, and crouched.  Iraq was attacking and we were going to be bombed.  The ground shook and debris rained down.  People were running around in a panic.  I was anxious to find my parents as I was leaving the recital hall.  I met with my father, I think.  We were trying to get as far away from the building as possible.  My cousin Allen was there, and he stopped at a little clubhouse off to the side to get some food.  I think my maternal Grandma Jane was with us, but we had yet to meet up with my mother, though we knew she was okay and coming.  We passed a park and went towards the parking lot where the car was.
