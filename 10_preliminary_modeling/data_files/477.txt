I am at a camp and see three boys walking. My female cousin is there. I was in the mountains and had to watch out. I thought I was in the country but was in a well traveled mountain. Cousin said something about "I thought you were under a truck". I lost my luggage. One piece was open. Hiked back to town carrying big duffle bags. My parents show up just as I get back to town.
