The only thing I remember about this dream is a jar of Guklins mustard rotating by my face. In the dream I don't know who threw it, but it was passing by my face in slow motion. The mustard was going so slowly I could read the label and see the brown specks in it. I could also see how the mustard shifted inside the jar as it rotated.
