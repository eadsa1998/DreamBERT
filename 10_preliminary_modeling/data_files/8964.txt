I was helping someone take care of their two infants. Even though in waking life the infants were much too young to consume anything other than milk, in the dream I was feeding them something other than milk. After I'd finished feeding the one incident I decided that she was thirsty. I knew that she was being breast-fed so I took her to her mother. I told her mother or that I have had her but that now she's thirsty. The baby was slipping in and out of sleep. I thought she needed to be nursed.
