I saw a boy who looked familiar.  Blonde flat top.  Reminded me of Jamie back in second grade.  The boy approached me and confirmed my suspicions; this was Jamie's younger brother.  He showed us pictures of Jamie, who had grown up to look rather nice.  His face was a bit longer and tanned.  Jamie had given his brother something to give to us, two little pop-up cards.  One showed an image, motion, like from TV, of him, his brother, and his father at a rocky area, like in the Stone Age.  In the other, we got a small live frog and a mouse.  They were mine, I guess, but I let my brother Stuart look after the frog.  The mouse got loose when we were trying to put them back in the container (card?).  We cornered the mouse and got it back.
