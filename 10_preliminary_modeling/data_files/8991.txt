There is an interracial couple in a discount department store with a child. Myself and someone else are talking with them because they asked for our advice about something. I had answered them and explained my answer or gave them factual information to back up my advice. Doctor C walks up behind me and I turn around and say to him, isn't that right Doctor C? I have a pen in my right hand and am tapping it against my left hand. I point toward him with the pen as I ask that and nodding my head yes. I squint my eyes and jokingly softly say, you better agree with me. All the time being very confident that he does have the same opinion. He tells them that he does but he says it in such a way that I'm not sure they believe him. He turns and walks away.
