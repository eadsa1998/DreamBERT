I am at BARBRA STREISAND'S home on Lake Street. She is preparing for a cast party and there are several people there, including a gray-haired, man who reaches over my back and we "exercise" (like the tumblers in the Christmas pageant). Frank walks over and asks me where I parked the car. I can't remember, I have to go to the bathroom, it is up two flights at the end of a sort of balcony; there is wallpaper on the wall; Barbra's assistant stands there as I sit on the toilet and she tells me how they redecorated the place. Other people talk to me while I pee! It is getting late; I am supposed to be at the Book Cafe at 11:30, but I can't remember where I parked the car....
