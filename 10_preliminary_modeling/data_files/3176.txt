I go into the bathroom to get ready for my date with Bob H. He'd written that he's coming and would like to see me. He's in the living room with his teen children, a boy and a girl. I try to get into the bathroom to do my hair, but the rock stars are all over and getting their makeup off. Bob thinks I look nice, but I don't think so.
