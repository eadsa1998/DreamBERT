I was at Nana's. They weren't there, but a bunch of people that I knew were. I went into the kitchen and there was a trail from the fridge going underneath the cabinet. There were big dead spiders and other creatures. Gunnar was there too and was talking to Mom in Nana's room. Then he left and I asked what they really talked about and she said a movie festival, the law and water bottles. Lafayette (True Blood) and I decided to look under the fridge and we shined a light to see something big in the middle. We focused and there was a huge spider with 3 minions in front with angry/evil faces. We screamed and ran. I got someone else to take photos and we killed one without the evil face.
