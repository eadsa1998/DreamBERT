I was scheduled to go to the city with Brad and Jimmy at five or six PM. I was getting ready to go when my brother came in needing help on some stupid class assignment. I helped him for a while, and when I looked at the clock again, it was 8:00pm, and too late to go. I yelled and I screamed and made a fuss. I went to the library, checked out, and read, a book on the various forms of fussmaking. And then my room was getting dark. The hair fell out of my picture of Grieg on the wall. Instead of striking me as odd, this just scared the shit out of me and I "woke up". I sat up in bed, leaned forward, and kind of examined the floor underneath the Greig picture. I turned on the light and everything. After I was finally satisfied that hair had not fallen out of the picture, I had a dream involving the little theater downtown. The theater had just gone out of business and the proprietors had turned it into an antique shop. I thought this was a disgrace. At the very least they could have turned it onto a film museum.
