I was at a big meeting of Catholics in a huge house in the country, and I didn't want to talk to so many people so I shut myself in a bedroom and took a nap. Then it seemed that people had been asking me for money for one thing and another until I had none left--I was mad about that. I went downstairs and on the way to the stairs I remember seeing a woman at a switchboard and a man on an elevator. When I got to the bottom of the stairs there were so many people there and when I saw my husband coming down the stairs, I decided to play games with him and hide. But he went home without me, and I started walking home on the country road in the dark. Finally, someone in a coach pulled by horses picked me up and it was raining. Then I woke up.
