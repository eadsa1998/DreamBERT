I remember my boyfriend and I getting in the back seat of a vw bug, but the bug was a limo bug. It was white and the interior was red cushy seats. Then I remember being in a building, like a warehouse with many floors and we were hiding from something scary. That's all I remember. It left me feeling very terrified during the dream.
