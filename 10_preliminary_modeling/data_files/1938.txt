I now live at Mabel's house with a young man named Jeff, who is learning counseling, and my sister Lydia or Paulina. It is a warm atmosphere where we use and learn counseling techniques. I start singing with someone. He sings, "I have the time." I repeat, "I have the time." It's a hearty blues/gospel song with background singers and clapping. It is joyous and strong. I am in excellent voice. I sit in between two people at a small round table on stage. I wear a hat that's too far down near my eyes. I keep trying to move it up so I can see and be seen better. I stand up while singing, my left arm around "Elmo's" shoulders. We sing, "To see the world," and then the best line, "Angels, hanging in the sky." I am thrilled at how well I can sing. It is beautiful.
