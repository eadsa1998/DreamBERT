I was in my mother's hometown for business for a couple of days. Bev lived there and I went and visited her for a little while. I was feeling restless so I told her I was going to drive by Aunt P's and Aunt H's. It was 9:10 p.m. I said I bet they go to bed at 9 or 9:30 but that's okay. I'll just drive by and see if they are still up. If they are I might stop in for just a little bit. As I was driving there were these people outside and they had these big balloons, maybe 2-3 feet in diameter. There was a place that was roped off and the balloons were on string like maybe helium filled. I thought that maybe it was students doing some kind of a weather project. I went on over to their house and the lights were on. I saw them both sitting in the living room with their pajamas on. I stopped and knocked. Aunt H answered the door and was very surprised to see me. She thought that maybe something was wrong. I said, no I was just in my mother's hometown for a couple of days and I just stopped by to say hello because I saw you were still up. I sat and visited with them for a little bit and then left. As I was going back to my hotel, I guess, I stopped where these people were working with these balloons because there were more people there now. I asked them what they were doing. They were growing babies. There were all these babies born only with the head. They would take the heads and attach something that would grow a body. Then they put them in this balloon to allow the body to grow. They would float these heads in these balloons until the bodies grew.
