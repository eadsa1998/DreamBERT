Dad wanted to put together a CD for Grandpa and he went to Specs and he got these CD's. And we were standing on balcony at the mall and he knocked them over the banister and they all went falling and crashing down to the first floor. And, I don't know, all of a sudden they had this CD writer on a picnic table, and he said that he went back and he got another one, and he was saying that this nun named Angelina wrapped the CD's. And then I was, he had to take the sound equipment and put it in a box for some reason, and then he gave me the box and told me that I had to put it all back together. And I took the equipment out and set it back on my desk like it goes, and I was started to put the wires back in and they were all going in pretty good, and then the wires for the speakers on the west wall weren't going in so good and I needed help putting them in. And Dad was on the phone, so I needed help putting them in. And I woke up before the wires could be connected again.
