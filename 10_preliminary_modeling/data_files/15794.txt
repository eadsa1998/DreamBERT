I was at a place which had all playgrounds - not sure if just one for each or ALL - with some other people including Jamison who was same age as we last saw him (8?). I found the McDonald's one and it was one I liked as a kid - vibrating seat spinny thing and I was saying it brought back memories of 'when I was in love with Bill Moseley'. Later on we were in another room with more people and Bill Moseley was there. I was standing nearby and briefly spoke to him and Jamison started to say she's in love with you - I said ssh and put my hand up to him but it was obvious what he was going to say and Bill was like 'it's ok' and then he said that I was thinking about him whilst on the vibrating seat and I was like omg but then we all had to sit in a circle for some Lords of Salem re-enactment thing and Bill was dressed like that and he walked around the inside of the circle putting these small skull stickers on people's chins and kissing it, when he got to me he did the same and then kissed me on the lips. I was like *inside squee* I woke up in the dream not long after to find my door open (at hotel in Kununurra) and I flashed my torch to check and then I heard Hector asking Mikhail if he'd opened my door and woken me up and then the conversation was muffled but it was implied he had come into my room and I thought he had kissed me.
