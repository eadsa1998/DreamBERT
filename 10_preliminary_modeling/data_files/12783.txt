I was at Nana's and Eugene was going to be there. Nana was annoying me about him. She saw Darius, because he came too, and said "Is that the one you like?" and I said "No, I don't like either of them". We were sitting at a table and Eugene was sitting next to me with his feet on the table. He was reading and he kept 'making' me write. He was asking me questions such as "Where's the toilet?". I was making a game?
