 I'm with my friends Norman Noman, Hank Anderson, a classmate named Jake, and others. We're in Norman and Hank's room smoking marijuana. I am having difficulty lighting the lighter: I can't get it lit. Then I try and light the pipe on fire! The flame is large, and I quickly snuff the flames out on the bed. The pipe breaks into many pieces. I think this is terrible: I am going to have to buy Norman a new pipe!
