I am a man and I am teaching children to read in a one-room school house. I am gentle and dedicated. A woman, the wife of my neighbor comes in. I fall in love with her. She helps me with the children. On lunch break, I go outside and mow the lawn because being close to her is too hard. I might declare my love. Then the mowing becomes a ritual. I am naming the woman I flirted with and liked as I pass my hand over a pile of veggie stuff in a freezer. I do that twice and when I call her name, the freezer compartment is nearly empty and cold. I feel desolate. I get on my horse to go to another town. My horse must walk down a stair like "carnival ride" apparatus. Then the horse had to sit on its ass and slide the rest of the way. I am impressed with the horse's ability and feel badly that I put it through so much difficult maneuvering.
