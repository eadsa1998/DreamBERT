A car in front of a friend's house. I sprinkled a bit of gasoline on front seat, using a plant watering squirt jar. Just as I finished putting this on the seat, Emma walked up, and started to get in, and smelled the gasoline, and asked, "Did you do this?" I confessed I did. I opened door on house side and rolled down windows, so it would air out and evaporate. And we walked toward home silently, I am shocked (in the dream) about my primitive jealousy for not being asked to read my poetry at the car owner's celebration.
