Dad and I were on a boat, and we were like going across the diagonally off the sea wall of the beach. And then we got out of the boat. We were swimming and we were supposedly taking a shortcut to Cash and Carry. And we were swimming, and then we eventually made our way up to the beach and workers were like putting things in the sand. And there were all these electrical fan-like type things that were making noise up and down the beach. And then we were walking on the beach, and I remember being scared of all these things. And then I woke up.
