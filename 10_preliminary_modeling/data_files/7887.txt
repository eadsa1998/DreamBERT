I can't place where we were, but we were someplace for school. I spoke with Monty about my paper and he was irritated, disappointed. He was talking to me about my paper and how there were several questions and I only answered one of them, and even then I only answered with a couple of paragraphs. It was just barely passing work. He just didn't understand and was really bothered by this. He said, I'm sorry. I said, no, don't be sorry. I feel the same way. My work has not at all been what I would like it to be. This aren't really excuses but. I told him about the year I've had being unemployed, etc. So unfortunately it was not just your class that suffered. It was the others as well. In some way that made him feel a little better. Still, he was a little disappointed. So I asked him if there was anyway to make it up or to redo the paper or add to it or anything. He didn't think that was possible. we were laying in the grass together, like spooning. There was clearly some affection there. I don't know what that was about.
