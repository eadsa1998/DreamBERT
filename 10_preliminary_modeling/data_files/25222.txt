 I'm at the Drive up window of the Oak Valley Bank. I deposit $20, but wait to get $10 back. While I am waiting, my sister Heather and two young black men come and harass me. They knock and pound on the windows of my mom's station wagon, which I am driving. I am then in the back seat, behind the driver's seat. One of the men is in the car sitting next to me. He jokes and teases me saying he is going to vomit in my car. I say, "No, please, don't vomit." We're about 15 feet from the drive up window. I say the lady won't let me get my money unless I pull up to the window. I pull the car up to the teller, but the tube with the money and transaction statement in it is covered with mail. The two guys push my car backwards. I run and stop it, stepping on the brake. I don't sit down in the car because the man vomited on the driver's seat. The vomit looks like the donut sprinkles. I swear! Heather drives away in a gray car. I pick up and stack big bags of potatoes and something else. I think that it's tough to love Heather when she does stuff like this. I curse her name. I think of the Butter-Cream movie in which the philosophy is always to be kind and respect others no matter how they treat you.
