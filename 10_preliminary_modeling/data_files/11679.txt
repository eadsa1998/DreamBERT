I dreamed that I was at a large party with quite a few friends. We had been at a wedding and then came to this party which was presumably a reception. I was having a very wonderful time when all of a sudden I remembered that I had a date with a girl. I was supposed to pick her up at 8:30 and it was 11:30 by that time. I was quite worried and rushed home. I was going to call the girl, but as I thought the matter over I was quite worried. I didn't know what to do. I remember my father was very mad at me. I kept trying to figure a way out of the problem, but I couldn't. I woke up in the morning very much worried until I realized it was a dream.
