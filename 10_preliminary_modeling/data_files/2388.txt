Lucy, her husband Justin, Katrina and I are seated around a table. We are talking. Justin says, "You don't want to know." I say, "Yes, I want to know." He says, "Lucy wanted to know and now look at her. She cries and hurts and whenever she hears the song 'A man loves a woman.' She's deeply hurt. It's not worth it."
