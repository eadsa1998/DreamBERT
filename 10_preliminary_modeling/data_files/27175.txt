I dreamt that I was in a large paneled library--and every wall was covered with books--only the books all had little people on them. There were many people in the room--but I can not remember who any of them were, except one man who I met at a concert in Boston--I have not seen or heard of him since. I recall he had a long broom in his hand, and appeared to be telling the guests who the people on the books were. They were in the majority, my classmates at college. Something he was saying about them was making me mad, and I remember I yelled something at him and he disappeared and suddenly I was alone in the library--I recall trying to leave but there was no door--then I woke up.
