I didn't do an optional assignment in Physics. Mom was annoyed and really angry. She and Darren were talking about Nathan Greenbaum being a "fatherly figure". I thought they were talking about Dmitri, but then Mom said "top of the class" and I realized it was Eugene. She went to school and told them to put me into tennis. I was like "What?! You can't put me in tennis, I'm doing six IB subjects!". I had a plant and it moved. I was going to call it Harris, after Ryan Cartwright in Seriously Weird. Ezra and Clayton had some stinky thing. I couldn't smell it, but it hurt me and made my mouth taste yuck.
