 I'm deer hunting in a park-like place with the Ramos'. The sun is five to ten degrees above the horizon. We are late getting out to our deer stands. I'm disoriented, and can't find my stand. There are other hunters around. I sit near a stadium field, where there is another hunter. I'm in a hurry, and I don't have a warm hat. I'm told to let the other hunter shoot does. I climb up a tree. The tree bends to the ground, so I am sitting atop of the trunk, which is bent in the shape of an upside-down U. I see a deer running. A shot is fired. Someone has hit it on the run. It doubles back and runs towards me. I fire, but no bullet comes out of the gun: it's like a misfire. The deer runs down towards another hunter, who fires and misses. The deer runs right towards me. I see two figures: a deer and what appears to be a person, running close together. I have a double-barrel shotgun. I aim the gun and fire. The deer falls dead on the spot, half blown apart. People come and look at it. I have shot a boy, maybe in addition to a deer. They may be separate, but the boy seems to have been wearing part of the deer on him as he ran. This is a terrible accident. Others and I feel guilty. I notice the safety on my shotgun is still off.
