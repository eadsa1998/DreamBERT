I had the most vivid dream that I was in the bookstore buying a sketchbook for architecture. The paper was all different sizes and organized into pretty different colored binders. It was also spring weekend, so when I left, there were bands playing outside. Everyone everywhere was drunk and dancing and I became really sad that I was going to graduate soon. Also, I weighed myself in my dream and had gained 8 lbs --weird.
