I and a man are sexually interested in each other. It's teasing and exciting. He and I kiss and walk and talk. We or I have a hamburger diner that I sort of live in. We walk past two others that are so tiny I wonder how anyone can do any work there and actually make hamburgers. I see rows of catsup bottles on a shelf and a hamburger ready to be cooked. It has a tiny order window. We walk on. We lay on the grass and I draw something on the grass. It's words. It starts with the word "sex" and to the left is another word and on a curve is another word, and a line he wrote crosses my line and makes it hard to read. He tries to read it and says, "I know it starts here," and points to the word "sex." Two other men are nearby and my man gets possessive and jealous and says to them, "She's mine, you understand?" I say indignantly, "Hey, let's get this straight. Yes, I'm with him, make that clear, but I decide when I walk and when I work!" He's embarrassed that I am such an untamable woman, but what can he do? He loves me. We go into the house/diner to find a room to be alone together to consummate our passion. Now I am walking down a hall at an institution where mentally retarded people live. A woman aid says, "It's so amazing. We have to coerce them to get to their writing, but when they finally get interested, there is no stopping them." It's something to watch. They get intensely involved observing things to write about. She describes how one mentally retarded woman went to a window and said, "This is a man, and here is his head and his hands and here is his dick" (the metal handle used to open the window), and then the aid demonstrates how the woman takes the handle into her like it's a dick and has orgasm. I am a bit shocked but, hey, this is life. The life force can not be denied. There is something about aids helping disabled people to have orgasm.
