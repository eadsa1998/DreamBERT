I found myself with two men, one of whom commanded me and the other one. He was happy and tall and the other one (B) was shorter and I saw myself of medium size (about 5'8). I was serious and we went into a room which was lower than the floor; that is, it had exactly three steps. Inside the room, which was furnished and had a window on the right and a table with a rug (small), the happy man (A) told the other one (B) to put up a bookshelf of the kind that goes around a vertical axis. This man (B) started to make it and when I saw that he couldn't make it, I offered to help and he refused and then accepted when I insisted. (When the tall man -- A -- told him to make the shelf, he went behind a curtain into another room.) I was making the shelf with the other one when suddenly the happy man (A) appeared and started to scold B. As though everything went blank, I don't remember anything for a few moments, but then the man (A) was scolding me and I was tying the man (B) on the floor on some kind of stretcher. (I remember that when we went in the room, we had two suitcases that the three of us had stolen from somewhere and we put them in some kind of basement of the room and the man -- A -- who was about 30, laughed and said that the three of us would have lots of money and then he ordered B to make the shelf.) After tying B to some sort of stretcher, I don't' remember anything else in relation to this dream.
