I am at a party or gathering of relatives and family friends.  It seems like I am a child.  It is an interesting party, I seem to remember being dressed up, or much planning beforehand, but I am not sure the purpose of the party, it doesn't seem too organized.  I am not familiar with the place, the house.  There are stairs, rooms.  There is some issue of flirtation or sex with a dark-haired man there.  I like him a lot, but there's something improper about it, either he is related to me, or because I am a child and he is an adult, or else he is already involved with someone.  I think he propositions me.  There was more.  Somewhere in here, I see a small ship, like the ship I saw at the fair booth, and I take it and hide it beside me or behind me, in a coat, on the car seat.  I want it and take it.  I want to play with it later, and I knew that I wanted to act out scenes, like with dolls and playthings, I feel a need to fantasize and act out these fantasies with dolls and items.  I am thinking about bondage, how I really liked that with Lynn, how when he did it he looked so intensely at my nude body, and I want to not only fantasize it, but act things out with toys, to see the whole thing from above.
