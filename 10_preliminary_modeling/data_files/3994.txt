["Washing dishes with the Native Americans"]  We finished some kind of big dinner. Theresa is there and other Native Americans. Time for clean up. We walk into the kitchen. I choose to wash instead of dry. The sink, a big industrial sized one, is full of dishes already soaking in warm soapy water. I wash as Theresa and I talk, pleasantly. I get the dishes done and look over at the stove. There are lots of very dirty dried on food pans waiting. I don't want to wash them. We decide to soak them. I tell Theresa we should put away the food so it won't spoil. She says she'll slice up her turkey and we'll put it away. Then I'm in the next room setting up some pieces of papers on a table. We are going to do collage like art work. Lots of people, maybe the whole tribe will be involved doing this. I chat with some nice guy.
