I was doing something for SAID. I'm not sure where I was. There were other people I was working with but I don't know who they were. [I'm fairly sure that I knew them in the dream, but don't know if they were people who are familiar to me in waking life.] Occasionally I was in an office that reminds me of the BCC corporate office. Several times, I had to take paperwork to a specific department. After the second time, I remembered a different way to get to that department where I wouldn't have to walk by so many people, or so many of the same people. Once when I went the different way I saw Whitney P. Someone people had been talking about chocolate. She said something about having the good stuff, and pulled out the kind of box that we get from Arthur F. She broke a piece off the corner and began eating it. There was also something about transporting ourselves from one place to another, but not in any real way. It was more like something you see in a sci-fi movie or television program. It seems kind of like walking through walls, but we wouldn't end up in just the next room, but in a totally different place. If you did this in a sci-fi movie, you would end up in a different dimension or different planet, but this more like a faster way to get around here.
