For some reason or another I was getting a keyboard, either I was getting one or Melinda was going to bring one over. And it had steel keys, and we were back from a walk, and I got a call from Melinda's cell phone saying that she would be right over bringing the keyboard and we were going to jam. And so I went upstairs to get my sound system set up, get the mixer ready to take the keyboard and mix it with my voice. And I, for some reason the CD burner was sitting on my chair. And then I realized that there were two of them; there was one in its normal position and one that was sitting on my chair. And I was supposed to put it on top of the tape player, which is to my right when I'm sitting at my desk, and the amplifier and CD burner are to my left. And I was supposed to put the second CD burner on top of this tape player, and there was also this extra external CD player that would feed stuff into the mixer for me that I had to, and so I was stacking up all these units and then I turned the light off and I sit down and I turn on my amplifier, and the amplifier is just this massive, this massive receiver like I see in Sound &amp; Vision and it's got this fluorescent display that these wild colors that change color with the tone that I hear. And it had a tape deck built right into it. I was like, "Wow!" And I exploring all these different functions, and I was listening to a Kenny Rogers tape in it and it sounded pretty good. It didn't sound as good as my other tape player though for some odd reason. And if I was listening to this tape and watching the display fluorescently change and the indicators flash, I slowly faded into consciousness and my radio came on and startled me awake. I never did get set up to jam with Melinda, which she really doesn't play the keyboard. I was just dreaming that.
