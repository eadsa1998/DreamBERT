I and 3 or 4 other people, they were men, I believe, were climbing down a fairly steep gravel hill up at Camp near my hometown, and I had our little daughter with me. I was being careful that she wouldn't fall or something like that. We got to the bottom and I think there were one or two other events I don't recall. There was just me and another girl, which might or might not have been my wife; I don't really recall. We also had our baby daughter with us. We had to stay there overnight or something like that rather than climb back. Then it was early next morning and our daughter's diaper was dirty. We didn't have anything to change her into. So we had to leave that one diaper on her, and we were thinking about climbing up the mountain again with her and thinking about how this would give us some sort of distinction of being the first people to climb this mountain with a baby with a dirty diaper. I think we climbed it. I'm not sure. Then we were back in camp.
