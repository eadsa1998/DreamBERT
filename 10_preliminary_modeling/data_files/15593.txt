I lived in England, but somehow ended up just wandering over to Edinburgh. Nana was also Benjamin's grandma (?) but we weren't related. She was living there for a while (and had done before). I was at a shop and using an iPhone app to find nearby restaurants/cafes. I went to visit Nana and Benjamin came downstairs. I was playing on my phone on a lounge. He called out my name, but I wasn't sure if he was actually calling me or just saying my name, so I ignored it and then he called out again and I said "what?" and he said "Come here". He was close by and there was a guitar. He said it had 'five' [notes?] and I said "yay?". He said something I didn't understand and I asked him to repeat it and he said "did you just say 'yay' in your language?' and I laughed and went back to my chair.
