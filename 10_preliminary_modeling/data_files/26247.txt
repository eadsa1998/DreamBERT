 An upper-class woman and others are being chased. She runs from men because she has no freedom. She runs through a hotel-like place where she has come to stay. I'm running through the hotel. I go through many rooms, which are part of her huge suite. There are many bedrooms, bathrooms, and living areas. One room has a pitcher of milk and a small table. I run through these chambers, going up and down stairs, hiding. I run outside. I'm running with my high school classmate Sara Cushing. People throw grenades at us. We throw back vitamins, which are bombs. We shoot guns and kill many of the murderers. We run, and enter a place where there are bowling alleys to the left. Sara goes to hide in back of the lanes. I run into a room. From this room I go to a door that won't open all the way. Someone is above the door holding it closed because they don't want me to go in: it isn't safe. I enter a room on my left and close the door behind me. The door has a two-pronged latch to fit into an eyelet. I don't lock the door. I quickly go into a room and close and close the door behind me. The door immediately locks: I hear it click. As soon as the latch locks a small black machine with one large and two small tubes begins pumping poisonous gas into the room. I realize I'm going to die. There are metal bars enclosing me in the room, separating me from the gas machine. I shudder when I see a cold naked dying person curled up on the floor. I cover my mouth and nose. I know I'm dreaming.
