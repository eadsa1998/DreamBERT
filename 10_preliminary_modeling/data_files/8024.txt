I was living at my birth home. My father was the man who is the father in the TV show State of Grace. He was a very kind, loving, compassionate father. He had some health problem and was required to rest and not be too active. It seems as though he was in the hospital. I brought in a deck of cards and I moved his tray close to him so he wouldn't have to stretch or move too much to play. There were four of us playing. I commented once that I didn't like the playing cards we were using because the symbols were too confusing. At least for me, I added. The others didn't seem to have a problem. We were each supposed to have three cards in our hand at all times. When it was our turn, we would lay one card down and then draw another from the stack. I have no idea what the game was. I realized I had a lot more than three cards in my hand. At this point it seemed that we were at home and Daddy was standing behind me. He told me to turn my cards face down and he would take the extras away. He took quite a few. I showed him there were still way too many, so he took more. I was wearing my purple sleep shirt and I walked outside on the back sidewalk. Daddy came up behind me and hugged me. I was crying. He wanted to know what was wrong. I told him how frustrated I am because I try so hard to lose weight and to get my sleep schedule under control and I continue to be unsuccessful. I told him I need help but I don't know who can help me or how.
