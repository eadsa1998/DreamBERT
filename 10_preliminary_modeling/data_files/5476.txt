[1997-05-08] I was in my parent's old house and it looked somewhat like the basement did, the whole house was really dark and there was some sort of gathering of S people (a social club, a refuge for survivors of abuse). And there were like people everywhere and I was wandering around, listening to different groups talking, and finding out who they were and the basement was sort of dimly lit with a kind of yellow incandescent bulb in the ceiling. And there were people sitting on the stairs I knew, some friends I knew from college. That was really weird, and so I stopped to talk to them for a while and then I went upstairs into this kitchen which wasn't my parents' kitchen. And it was really dark in there with candles and stuff lit and there were these people and one of them I recognized as being a member of S. Guess they probably all were but, I recognized one who goes by the name Shadow Dancer. And he said something about do you want to join us and for some reason I had it in my head that they were witches and I wanted to belong but I didn't want to be part of it even though I didn't think they were doing bad magic. Anyway, I didn't like the idea of witchcraft of any sort and I said "no"... I was supposed to fly home and it was much later than I thought, and I felt really bad because I hadn't called my parents. I was walking everywhere in the house, looking for a phone.
