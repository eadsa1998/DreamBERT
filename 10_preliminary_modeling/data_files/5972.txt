X (a former male co-worker) presents me with a greeting card and asks me to read it. I read aloud some printing in English. "No, not that part", X says. "I can read that. Read this part." He points to some handwriting at the top of the card which is in Spanish. I read aloud again, this time translating the Spanish into English for him. (I do not recall what anything on the card actually said, but I do recall that the Spanish section was about one or two sentences of simple words that I could easily recognize.)
