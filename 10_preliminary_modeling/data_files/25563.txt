 I'm walking near the Brimson campus, looking for a vehicle owned by my friend Hank Anderson. It may be a truck. My friend Norman Noman pulls up in Hank's car. We decide to go to the High View Cafe in Hank's car. I get in. Norman drives fast. The band sugar is playing on the radio, but I don't recognize the music right away. Norman asks me if I like Sugar. I say I do. We are on a road that is on the edge of a cliff. Jordan drives around a corner going way too fast. The back end of the car slides off the edge of the road, and we slide down the cliff, which is a steep rocky granite hill. We stay right side up, not flipping over. The car stops. Norman tries to drive back up the slope. The car won't drive up the slope. I get out of the car, as it is stuck in the rocks. Norman again tries to drive it out of the rocks. The car tumbles, rolling down the rock slope and lands at the bottom. Hank has a northern pike that dies. Norman and I walk back to the road. The car is stuck 60 feet below the road in a stream at the bottom of the cliff. A man who runs a store says that we won't be able to get the car out. We have to tell Hank that his northern pike is dead.
