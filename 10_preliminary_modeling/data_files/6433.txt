The area by the beach was condemned as a whole, quarantined and evacuated. People went in and cleaned it up. The town begins to resemble Venice. The Pope is coming to make a tour. Somehow I meet the Pope and take him around downtown, I talk to him but he keeps breaking into Ukranian and Greek. He says he's going to go meet the Ali Baba Kiosk guy, "Jimmy", over in the entrance to the city (a long green-walled channel sixteen feet deep) because it reminds him of his "native Macedonia". The Pope has made a four CD set wherein he comments on and talks about our town. In a variety of languages, of course. I, his new friend, am to walk around the newly refurbished beach area selling the CD. All the houses were sparkling blue and white. There was a dance hall by the entrance to the city; Perry's Coffee Shop moved into it because its old building was condemned. We were listening to Middle Eastern music. On the Pope's orders nobody could drink caffeine. Naturally, everybody in Perry's was pissed! So I went down into the beach -- I was smuggling caffeineated coke in. And the way I got it in was by putting it in these huge berry gatorade jars. This is how I met the Pope -- he saw me bringing the "non-caffeinated" drinks into the "ghettoes" (now the best part of town) and decided I was his friend. Before the pope left to meet "Jimmy", he told me I couldn't come, because they would be talking about "highly secret things." But wait -- I didn't speak a word of colloquial Albanian, did I? So I could come along if I liked. It occurred to me that I should run over to the library and learn Albanian real quick so I could hear all the Pope's secret discussions.
