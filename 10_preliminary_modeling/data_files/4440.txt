["Judging the contest."] I am standing in the back of an auditorium. A group of people, mostly if not all women. Maybe they are nurses. They are graduating. A woman official asks me to be the one to note their names. Then I am asked to call on them to receive their diplomas. The other woman who was going to do that is ill. I agree and walk up on stage. I choose to step out on a small platform that juts out closer to the audience. They are a far distance away. I find the paper with the list of names on it. Each has a title "C. Cannabis Mavis" or something like that. They give me that title as well. I have a hard time seeing the paper and have to move it around to catch little shafts of light coming from back stage. I hand out the diplomas. The ceremony is over and I walk back to the back of the auditorium. I stand with a man I'd been talking with before. He is leaning against the wall. I stand close and lean into him and we cuddle. It feels sensual and friendly.
