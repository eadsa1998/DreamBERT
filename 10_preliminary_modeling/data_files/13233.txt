I was lining up for Intro Calc. Eugene and Darius were there. Some kid got scared of Darius because his arms were really hairy. Eugene had a Doctor Who like coat on and he looked really hot, so I got my phone out to take a photo, but Mr Haynes came. This girl was attached to the hip of her sister. The hosts came to our class.
