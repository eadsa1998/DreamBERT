There was a book published, like a book of essays and the authors of these particular, essays were going to get together and do a public reading of the book, each author was going to read their one of their essays that were in the book. And I had several essays in the book and I was trying to decide which one to read. Only I was reading it in print, I was, I had to get fairly close to the page, the way I had to when I was younger to see the print, but I was reading the print book. I was trying to select an essay and I was reading bits and pieces of different essays and trying to decide. I was in I guess it was some sort of conference room, I wasn't sure what kind of room it was, it had a sort of very thick, plush, maroon carpet and large tables and really big windows. It was a really huge room.
