I was on the train. I saw a girl and guy who were from One Tree Hill on there (not real ones). I sat in a seat a few seats in front of them. Hilarie Burton sat down next to me and I commented that lots of people from One Tree Hill were on here. We talked for a bit. I can't remember properly, but I was then in a car with Mom meeting someone in a carpark. We had like $1 million in the car in cash, all in $100 notes. We had no bags or shoes and packed all our stuff up in a towel. The police checked out the car. There were some notes sticking out and we gave it to the cops, laughing "we keep finding these [letters?]". We ended up at this house which was far away. Then it was a movie or show and this black guy and this kid were in it. They looked alike and I thought it was good casting. They left the wife behind to go there and the kid wasn't happy he had to leave again. Hilarie was then there with me and was sitting on a bed and there was stuff all over the floor and the bed.
