I was a hospital patient. I was with other men. I criticized something. Later I was urinating in the yard, and I was embarrassed to see a woman at the other end. But she did not seem to notice me. I went to her and found that she was a patient. She was attractive. I wanted to be friends with her. She was very reserved. She worked on a machine. The matron came, and the patient said I had better leave, and she would see me some other time. I left her at the machine she worked on.
