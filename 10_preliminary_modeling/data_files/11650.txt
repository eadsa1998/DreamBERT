I was walking over an open field that had a low-lying mist about my feet. I was with a little baby girl about four years old. I was holding her one hand and I believe a woman was holding her left. She was a little vague. We came to a cliff and the baby tried to jump off of it but we held her hand and kept her from it. Then the scene was in an auditorium and we were walking across the stage when the child broke loose again and this time jumped from the stage and fell to the floor on her head. Then I saw a woman playing a piano and I knew it was this little girl's mother. How I don't know, but I knew I associated her with the little girl in this manner. Then the woman opened a drawer of a desk and the woman and a few others all had a very surprised expression on their face and it was one of shock and horror. I myself could not see what was in the drawer but knew it must be something very horrible. The woman reached in the drawer and very tenderly lifted out the 88 keys of the piano which were all tied together in one long string. They all began to weep. They then opened the second drawer (which I could not see what was in it either) and she took out the piano legs and strings. They then opened the third drawer and the mother tenderly lifted out the arms and legs and body of the little child I had been walking with. Each time they opened a drawer they would have this very startled expression on their face. The dream ended here.
