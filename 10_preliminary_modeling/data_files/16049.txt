I was at school at nighttime, and I was sitting up on the steps that lead up to the third floor. And I was with two other girls, and they were talking about a Christina Aguilera concert that they were going to and I was with them talking about it. And then all of a sudden the alarm system goes off. And we were running, trying to get out of there, we were just trying to get out of there, and then once we were out in the courtyard, it shuts off. And the announcements come on, the intercom system comes on and says that it was just a test, it was just a drill, don't evacuate the building. And then for some reason it goes off again and a few seconds later it shuts off. And then we were just sitting out in the courtyard for a while, and I walked through the place where the cafeteria is. And I felt really heavy over there. I felt like there was way, like four or five times more gravity over there than there is, and I learned that they put submarines down over there and that's why I felt so heavy. And I dreamt that Dad was going to go down in one. And before long, I woke up, thank goodness.
