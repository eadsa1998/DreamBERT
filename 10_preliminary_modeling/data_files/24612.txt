I was playing my violin with all my music friends. I am much more advanced than "Twinkle, Twinkle" but still, that's what we were performing. Last night I had a violin recital for real and played my hard pieces. At the end though, I played the duet to Twinkle. In my dream there was a girl at my level, or a bit above, who played Twinkle by herself, and then my other friends and I played duets but completely messed up. (This part didn't happen in real life.) Setting: It was on the stage: the same one from last night for real. Characters: There were all of my violin student friends. A group of girls who I play music with and goof off with. Some are a little bit spacey, but I still have fun with them. Feelings and Thoughts: Worried, confused. I'm sort of wondering about it, because I know I did well in the real concert. I woke up with my arms in the violin position!
