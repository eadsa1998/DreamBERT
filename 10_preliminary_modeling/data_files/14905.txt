I was at university. Ms Eckert was teaching. Evelyn was also in the class. We were given a strip of paper and scissors. She told us to cut something out. Everyone left except for Evelyn and I. I got bored so I got my ruler and sliced off the pieces instead of cutting them. She said I lost the race. She said we had to cut it and so the stuff properly to see who comes first. I went to get another one. It was a picture of a Runescape Christmas. I had gotten a distinction on one of these tests and was 100th percentile in the school. This guy I sort of liked was talking. I called Mom to say I was ready to get picked up. I walked out along with the guy and some girl. We stood at the edge of the road. A big bus came and people were standing and trying not to fall. Someone had a blue striped leg with holes and their big toe was upside down?
