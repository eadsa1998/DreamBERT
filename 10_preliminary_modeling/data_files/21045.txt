I was riding a trolley with a fellow. Then I took a train and the train passed the trolley I usually ride and I saw the fellow I rode with in the trolley as the train passed it. I got off and was going to walk home, but I noticed it was dark and I thought I might be held up, so I decided to ride the trolley. I got on and Mr. and Mrs. Russ were on it. Mr. Russ was the conductor. He took part of my fare and said, "That's enough." I had pennies. I remembered I had one Indian head penny, so I looked into my pennies and found a third of one Indian head penny. I took a good look at it. It was made of shiny copper. Mr. Russ asked me if I had any nickels. I found four nickels in my change, so I gave him them.
