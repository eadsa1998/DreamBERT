My toy box was in the games room. I was going through it and I found a folder of Pokemon cards. I was going through them and there were lots of empty spaces. I remember seeing Eevee and there was one called 'Croteas', instead of Vaporeon. Some of the cards were shiny. There were a few plastic sheets that were thicker and of better quality than the others. I showed Mom and asked her if we can get more. I was going to ask Ezra if wanted to collect them again. There was some show that someone was watching and I had a quick look and saw Kiefer Sutherland, and it was showing him looking up. I said "Hey, it's Jack!".
