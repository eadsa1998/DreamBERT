I go to a man's house for a meeting of people with computers. It is very late at night when we get done. I say, "It will be hard to pack all my equipment into my house when I get home and I don't want to leave it in the car all night. It will freeze." I see snow on my computer keys. The old man says, concerned, "You don't have anyone to help you?" I say, "No." A young man who likes me helps pack it up for me. I get a pile of clothes and look through it and find some outfits for my little girl, who is tired and cranky. We start to walk home and the streets are wide with double lanes and it is daylight, even though it is very late at night. A few cars drive by. We turn a corner to the right and the little black girl whines and cries and lays down. I have to pull her along by her arm and apologize to her, saying, "We have to make it home. Please cooperate." We find the apartment, walk down a stairs and go in. Supposedly this is sort of in the slums and dangerous, but the place looks fine. When I get in, I see the man has already brought my computer and set it up. I put the clothes on a table and take the girl to her bed, asking her if she wants a drink of water. She whines and then goes to sleep immediately. I feel tired too.
