WALLY is 4 years old in the dream; I am about to say good-bye to him but he runs away; as he runs he becomes quite small and he struggles to keep his hat on his head. It keeps slipping off; I try to grab him and to help him, but he escapes my grasp. At the same time I feel a sharp PAIN in my LEFT HAND, I think a rat or very big mouse has bitten my left hand. I can't shake it off; I try to scream and wake up....
