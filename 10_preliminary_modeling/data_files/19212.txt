I dreamt I was having lunch on a high cliff sort of overlooking the bay, San Francisco Bay. I was talking to a woman who seemed like a Molly Goldberg type person, and there were two other people, a man and a woman, that were friends and they arrived in a speedboat. They were asking me, "What do you want?"
