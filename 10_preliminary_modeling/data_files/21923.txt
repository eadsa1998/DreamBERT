I was in Rivertown, the town of my boyhood days. I saw the town and the coke ovens and the coal mines and how the people started these businesses. Then I went to look at the old town to see how it looked. I first saw the town, the homes. They seemed to have been covered over with some kind of a plastic like and the ovens were a little cleaner and clearer. Then I saw an example of a man in the olden times where a rope was tied around the man's waistline and he went into a tunnel or coal mine and was for safety's sake protected by the line or rope to get out safe. Then I went further and I saw a man who was trying to cheat me out of my money I was to get for my venture into the coal mine. I cussed him something terrible and I told my paying man what he was doing. He finally called him out and said, "This is a son of George Jessel." Then I was sorry for what I called him and I went up to him and apologized. We shook hands on it. His hand was very sore from something he did in the mine, so I clasped his hand very lightly. I was called by a friend and he had a big, long pork chop for me. It was lean and nice. He started to chop in into chops and his dad came over and said it was not the right way to cut it.
