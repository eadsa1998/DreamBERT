With Reynaldo at a Church with a strange name: "Kunriquikoko" -- a Unitarian Church; it is very relaxed and friendly; Reynaldo wears Lederhosen and a white shirt; we walk about waiting for the service to start. Suddenly I get bitten on my finger by a DOG, see a little BLOOD; the minister fetches a handkerchief and blots up the blood, and bandages the finger. Later I rinse the handkerchief in water and see it turn red. -- The service starts and I sing in the Choir with a woman from the Retreat Center. I say I know all the songs from my Church in M. City.
