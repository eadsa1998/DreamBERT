I am seated in a classroom with lots of different-aged people, kids and adults studying together. Someone is at the board writing words down for the "game." I don't know the game and only half attend to the words as I also watch others. Some of them go up to the board and click on their video/computer things and look at colored images on the blackboard. Someone talks about the importance of the lap words. I realize I should write down those words that were already erased off the board. I remember the word "warf," I remember "gasoline" and "Tylenol" But then I realize the last two words aren't the "lap" words. I go up to the board to try and see if any of their words could still be read after they were erased. I complain that it's dark and the colored images overlap where the words had been. "How can anyone see the words like this?" I mumble. I go back and sit. I remember one more word "III," and write it. A boy comes over and wants to know did I remember to get him a pen knife. I smile and say yes. He's happy. I wonder should I give a knife to a boy so young. I feel sorry he has to study this with adults. It must be frustrating for him.
