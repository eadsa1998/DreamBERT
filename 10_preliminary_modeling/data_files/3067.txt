Someone burned my house down (like the M City House) and the insurance is going to pay for building a new one on the same location and I am happy. We are temporarily living down the street in a nice house, but it will be good to get back to the original location. Then I am concerned that the man who burned the house down will do something stupid and get caught, and they won't pay for a new house. Now I am getting into a submarine. As we go under the water, a sailor says, "Ah, I love being under the water. It's so safe and clean." I shudder, because I can't help but worry about what would happen if the sub sprung a leak or broke. We'd be killed by the tons of water, with no oxygen. We go to the bottom of the ocean. Now I am married to a man and he is having sex with another woman right in front of me, and I am hurt and angry, but I still love him.
