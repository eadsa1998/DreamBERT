I can't remember properly, but I was in some building with some others. There was this thing, which had this wood bottom and then a net around the outside. There were lots of these on top of each other.  You could sit in them or whatever. Someone opened this door and all these insects came rushing in, they were dangerous. We all started running. There were lots of halls and such. To get on the net thing, you had to pull yourself up on a rope to get to the higher ones, and then use the wood to pull yourself up higher. I got to the top level and there were three people in it, so I went to the one below it. Other people were stomping on the insects and trying to kill them. Finally they were all gone. But then another door got opened and there were more of them.
