Some family had organized for their daughter to marry Dad, but heard something about him before hand and said no. I went there to talk to the girl (now it was me that was supposed to marry her I think) and the mother yelled at me because she thought I was going to get up and go the father who had just pulled up. The daughter yelled at her and said she wanted to go with me. We all sat down to talk. They complained because I didn't go to church anymore and I was going to say 'church and God suck" but I said I didn't have to go to church to "prove my love for God". I felt like an idiot saying that and having them think I was Christian, but it was the easiest thing to do. This older lady told me I should wear shorter shorts and do some cheer thing and I said "or not".
