We had set up this thing to make people that Jennifer K had been killed. I mean we did the funeral and everything. Then later we had her hiding at Jean H and Carl H's house. After the funeral was over I went back there to see her and we realized that the people who tried to kill her the first time were out there somewhere so we crouched way down in a field. They came through and they were poking through the weeds with a stick and they just barely missed the top of our heads. It was a good thing that we were crouched down far enough. Fortunately they couldn't see us. And most people still believed that she had died. There were three men involved. The one man, the one who was the head of the ring, the worst character of the three, actually ended up dying. The other two ended up being hurt or injured or something because they ended up in the hospital. The one died and the other two recovered and did a complete turn around in their lives. I think I ended up dating one of them or being married to one of them.
