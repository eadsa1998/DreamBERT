I had sort of a strange dream that was based on sort of a science fiction story that I had read last night in which I was this man that could sort of get into somebody else's mind and follow them around wherever they went. It was a real eerie sensation to be in one place and in another place at the same time. I had some connection with the police or something and was following these people for some special reason this way.
