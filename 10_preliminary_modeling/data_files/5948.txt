Am in Florida in a large souvenir store and looking over the toiletries counter. A small tray of perfumes is getting all my attention and I also look at some perfumed soap and bath powders. Then I take a small bottle of something, probably perfume, and fold my hand over it so it is hidden. Continue to look at other things on counter and then slowly saunter toward exit. In meantime have casually transferred bottle to my rear trouser pocket. Then an elderly woman in front of me drops her lipstick on floor and looks at it as I come by. I am not anxious to bend down and pick it up, thinking bottle in pocket may show. But I quickly stoop down in sort of feminine fashion, keeping back straight, retrieve it and give it to woman. Then I walk out of store.
