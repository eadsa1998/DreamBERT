I was in class, in English. The class was different and I was at the very back. Ms Madsen had assigned leaders for something and they got these black coats to wear. The leader names were 'wind, earth, water and fire (me)'. I was putting the coat on and these people were watching me and laughing so I went out of the class to put it on. It was tight, so I took it off. This girl said they were laughing because of the "fat around your elbow". Fatima was next to me. Eugene came in to the class wearing a suit with a red tie as a costume for his class. He had a ring on and an earring and I was really annoyed. The girls kept bothering me and I got annoyed and said "so what? Why is that funny?". I pinched her cheeks hard and said that she had fat there. I threw something and it hit Johanna and I said "Sorry, didn't mean to hit you" and she got up and tried to attack me. There was a whiteboard at the front of the class. I tried to poke her in the eye with some pointy object, but I only did it gently, because it hurt my eye and it wouldn't go through anyway. I gave up and ended up knocking her out. I left with Fatima. My phone broke and I text "smile" and then "... or not". People were after us. People on the street could turn into them (like The Matrix). There weren't many people around though. I got into a car.
