Ernie is around as I am preparing to get dressed for my paper presentation. It is friendly, emotionally intimate and helpful. I put on a pair of panty hose which later I see now has holes and runs in them.  I put on a gray suit, the skirt zips up the front. I notice my tummy isn't as fat as in reality, but still has a bulge there. I am slim and looking very sophisticated. I feel good about my presentation.
