My mother and I lived in the apartment together.  My brother Stuart was moving in with us temporarily before their next apartment opened, I guess.  He was packing lots of stuff away, and I was worried.  I asked him how long he planned to stay; he said until Friday.  I wondered then why he was unpacking everything instead of leaving it in the car.  He wore a T-shirt that implied he was a vampire fan.  I thought this was interesting and asked him about it.  It was something that his wife Sheila had gotten him into and I was somewhat surprised, but realized it was totally hypocritical like her, to be a fan of vampires while a Jehovah's Witness.  There was a picture or two of a woman with her breasts exposed, one being quite larger than the other.  It was something he wanted to put up and enjoy while he could, as Sheila wouldn't allow that sort of art.  I was irked at all her influence over him.
