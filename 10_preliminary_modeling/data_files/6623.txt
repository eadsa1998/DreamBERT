Outdoors a little circle of white chickens on a green lawn. I step back and find I had stepped on and crushed a chick but it was dead before. In library at T.C.T. Many changes. Shelves being rearranges and a cozy corner with leather cushions added. I say how many advantages we get now that we are part of the University. Am reading a June magazine and see Wilcox's illustrated edition of Little Women. Shall read it next. Some hunting among books. Think I must go back to my hotel room but it is raining hard. O.M. comes in, offers candy to a number of people entering with him. I hesitate as to whether to step up and share as he passes to every one else first but when he comes to me, I ask if the white piece is peppermint. Then I'll take a lavender piece. He presses upon me a very large reddish piece too. Then I look out of the window and exclaim, "Just look at the streets, they are flowing like a river. The autos are pushing back waves of water." Then two cars get in so deeply that the engines are covered and at last only a blur is visible. 8 or 10 bodies come floating down. One 8 year old child with a smile on his face. At least he didn't suffer. C.D. suggests first-aid. Then she is pushing me. I feel angry and frightened lest I fall into the water. [T.C.T. formerly Normal School became part of University in 1931.]
