I was a patient in a hospital. I was just placed on the ward. The others left for the dining room, and I did not see them go. I did not know how to get there. I went on the porch. I was surprised to see female patients there. I spoke to one of them, and we went on the grounds. A little later I became worried that I would be missed. I was tempted not to go back at all. I was torn by indecision.
