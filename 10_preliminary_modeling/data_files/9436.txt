I run in and out as we are at a party. J. (husband of a friend, with whom I had had an affair) is there and we have a few minutes alone together. I tell him how much I had missed him and after a while he confeses he dreams of me often. We kiss. Shift: near the ocean. Marita is diving. Proud of her ability to dive but once she goes down and doesn't come up. I have to rescue her.
