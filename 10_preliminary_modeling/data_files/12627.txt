The school went to this shop place to get tested for HIV. Dmitri wasn't there. It was my turn and the lady put the stuff on my veins and then I decided not to do it. There were Goosebumps books there. I was trying to call Mom to ask for them and she had bought me some earlier. Evelyn got tested. I said I didn't have to because I didn't have HIV because "I've never had sex!" and also because I was scared of needles.
