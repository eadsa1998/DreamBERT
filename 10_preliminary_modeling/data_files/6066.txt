I dreamt that I was in a huge plane with my mother. I don't know where we were flying to but I believe we were going on a trip. All of a sudden the plane started to have mechanical problems. The captain came over the speaker and said we were going to crash. I was so scared almost to the point of being hysterical. I grabbed my mother's hand and ran to the storage part of the plane. The plane was falling, but not head first. It was falling flat. Since it was falling this way, we were elevated to the ceiling. I then heard the captain say, "This is it." I told my mother that I loved her and I think I started to pray. The plane crashed on its belly and I fell from the ceiling to the floor. My mother and I both were fine, just a little banged up. I was so happy, but then this fear came over me that the plane could still blow up. I ran to the door and tried to open it up, but it was locked. I looked out the window and saw a bunch of police out there with their guns drawn. However, all I could think about was the plane could still blow up and we had to get out of there. I saw a fire extinguisher and I tried to knock out the window. As I was doing this, the captain and some passengers were yelling at me not to do it because the police might shoot. They tried to explain that there were hijackers on board and the police might get anxious and start shoooting. But I didn't listen. I think I thought that I would rather take my chances of being shot than die by the plane's blowing up. So I broke open the door. The police raised their guns, but they realized my mother and I were [illegible] so they waved over to us to run to the police cars, which we did. As we were running the plane blew up, but my mother and I made it. Then I woke up.
