Blake, his wife and adopted son came by to visit me. I was glad. I enjoyed the talk. There was a small sense of uncomfortableness because Blake and I used to have a relationship, but we all worked at it being comfortable. I thought that even though they didn't make it to my party, at least I see them now. It was a good thing that I called them. I asked Blake to hang around and watch me work. I was learning new stuff. He agreed. I got suited up for surgery. I was like a practicum student at an emergency surgery. We went into the emergency surgery room. It was a party atmosphere because it was like "Super Bowl" day. We all agreed to chose code names. Mabel was given a name and I said, "No. It's better to call her 'clown'." We looked at each other, agreeing. I felt good I made this connection because the name had significance for her and I remembered I was "collected try" or something like that written in lifesavers. My brother Dwight or Cory was chastised for being uppity because he was a counselor. I thought, "Ha, they have snobbish classified staff here too." The teaching doctor asked me if I wanted to stay and watch. I said, "Yes, for a while and I also want to spend part of the day out front working," (intakes, etc). My old block car, the comet, was in the dream somewhere. They started talking about which team they rooted for. I thought, "No, I want to root for...," and then thought of the "M's," but I wanted to root for the M City team but I couldn't remember their name.
