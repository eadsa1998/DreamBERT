I'm in a big hotel with a group of people who are doing something special, the way LT is, but it's not that. Part of it involves sitting at a desk or table, a long one, like rows of people at desks or tables, keeping track of something or some kind of current paperwork. Sometimes you get up to do something else, or maybe it's a break. I get up to go with some people going to exercise, or swim. There's some activity at my place and I know I have to get back on time. When we get to the other place, it's as though it's someone else's house. The others I'm with decide not to swim but I definitely feel I need to work out, so I go to change my clothes. I find I haven't got all my stuff with me. I thought I had tights but I don't and I have to put on my leotard with the relatively loose leather pants I took off before. This is taking up time and I'm worried I won't get in enough exercise before I have to go back. Worse still, I have to pee first. I aim for where I know a pool is - the place at this point is laid out in a curve, so I follow it round - by the time I get there, it's really bad, and I'm further worried about the time I'm having to spend at this - I go around a corner and see a men's room and think, okay, there must be a ladies' nearby - but no such luck - I keep going down to where the restaurant is. I've been here before, and I'm frustrated because I know there is a ladies', but it's in the far right corner after you go into the restaurant. I wonder for a second if I should keep looking, but I go down to it anyway, and it's crowded. I figure I just can't wait anymore, and I take some toilet-paper squares (as they turned out to be) off the top of the paper-towel dispenser, go to a corner where nobody can see me for a minute, and pee. Presumably on the floor but it didn't make any noise, and I'm wearing a skirt now. I blot myself off quick and leave, crossing the restaurant to the opposite door as a shortcut to get back where I'd been.
