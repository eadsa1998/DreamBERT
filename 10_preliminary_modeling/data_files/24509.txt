I am searching for NVA hidden in the stalls of public bathrooms. In a frenzy I kick doors open. The enemy wear green uniforms and have long black hair. They are silent and beaten and offer no defense. I am yelling as I shoot. I am screaming. I am shooting at close range. When the dead slump down, there is little blood. After the killing I shoot them again.
