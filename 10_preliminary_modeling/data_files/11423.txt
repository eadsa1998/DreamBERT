I was working at the SS Kresge Co. Dr. Shenk (physics teacher) was also working there. He told me to go and count the amount of Christmas candy. I did this for about two hours. it was then time to go home. I left the store and discovered I lost or forgot my wallet. I rushed back into the store. The place was full of policemen who were having a party. I found my wallet. Then I awoke.
