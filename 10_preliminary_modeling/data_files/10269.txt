Frank and I are to meet my friend Cindy, but we made another commitment for the same time; we see her for 5 minutes and explain that we must honor our other commitment; she is disappointed and then drives off; shift: I see Frank and MY FATHER walk towards me in an open field; I run toward my father and hug him tight. very happy; very vivid.
