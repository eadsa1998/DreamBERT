A large playground in a park with aeroplanes landing on it as well. Edward, Marita and I are near a castle but suddenly there is a gas explosion. I run to a ramp where I can see everyone pass by. Lots of people rushing but no panic. Edward reaches me and we agree where to meet in the future. At one point see an aeroplane land and unable to stop so people scurrying away in big hurry. No one is hurt.
