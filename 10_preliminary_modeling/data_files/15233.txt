I was at dads, which was different. He was watching some show and it showed this guy 'killing' a pig and he was covered in lots of blood and I thought he looked a bit like Michael Palin. Later, it showed him again and I realized it was him and I clapped excitedly and said "Michael Palin, my favourite person in the world". I was reading about Jabberwocky and it had been made in 1928 and Michael Palin was actually born in 1914. I was confused about this and was thinking 'I'm sure he was born in 1943'. Terry Jones' real last name was Chalice and he was born in 1914 too. John Cleese was born in 1911. I couldn't remember Graham Chapman's name, but then I did. Dad cut my hair and then gave me this red and orange wig to wear. He was wearing one too and was like, in drag. I left and my car was American. Obama was around outside and I asked if anyone ever didn't recognize him. He said one time he had said hello to this black Christian lady but he had sung some religious song and she had said that he was a good singer and that he should join their choir. We laughed and he said it was embarrassing. I left and was having trouble driving, though I had driven the car fine in the US. The road was full of boxes and I drove over them. I saw one with Tom Conell on it, from January. I pulled over and took another car. I got home and I asked Mom to take me back to get the car. She said no because she was babysitting. Darren had the baby and it was called Kaylee and he said he would take me in a minute.
