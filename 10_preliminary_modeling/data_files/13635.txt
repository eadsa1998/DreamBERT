I was at home. Dad wanted me to print and scan stuff for him. Then he was going out. It was like 11pm or something and it was creepy so I called Mom and she said she'd be 10 minutes and I asked her to be quick. She also said she looked for season one of 24 and I said "We've got it" and I found it and put it aside to give to her. A car pulled up and I looked out the door. It was blue and not Mom's. I got my phone and went to call her but then she pulled up behind them. Some skinny guys got out and I said "Go away you stupid fat blobs!" and they laughed. Mom was asking them what they were doing here. They said they had been here last night. One had an accent like in The Green Mile. I made fun of him. I opened the door and found this metal pole thing and hit them over the back and they all fell. One of them was then Ezra and one was Evelyn. Then we had an excursion and we were at a shop. Calvin and I wandered around. We ate lunch and I had a ham sandwich. Eugene and Bradley sat near us. Then the four of us went away from the others. Eugene went over somewhere to pee and Calvin was like "Look at your boyfriend Eugene" and I looked over and his bum was showing. I laughed and I took a photo and he was like "hey!" and swearing. So I was filming him, but then he was laughing and was ok about it. Then it was dark and I was filming with Calvin's phone because it was better. Mom was then at the shop and she was looking at some fluffy jackets. Tucker walked past and she was like "What the hell is that?" and I said he was the one with a dead Mom. Daryl was there too. Then we were at a house. Elijah was there. We were gathering stuff and it was a game. I was getting something past Dad and he asked if I was playing this game called 'Whatever'. Calvin, Elijah, Samantha, others and I put this video camera in water. It exploded.
