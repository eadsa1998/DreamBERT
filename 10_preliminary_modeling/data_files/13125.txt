I was watching the first episode of Sliders and it was totally different. Steve Guttenberg and Katherine Heigl were in it. It was set in a space ship and they would randomly travel in time or space. In real life, I got this package and it was makeup. Dad and I were like "What the hell?". There were clothes as well, including some blue pants and some weird string thing.
