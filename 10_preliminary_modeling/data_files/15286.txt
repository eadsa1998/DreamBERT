Dad emailed a photo of him and his friend and mentioned me in the email. Some people were playing Sims 1 and Sims 3. I said my Sims games didn't work and a girl went to put a disc in my computer. She tried to force open the drive and I pressed the button instead. The fans were clear, but were pink/purple colour. Someone said they didn't want Sookie and Eric (True Blood) together and I thought 'neither do I, but I wouldn't mind me with Eric'. Someone on Restaurant City had a restaurant called Fangtasia.
