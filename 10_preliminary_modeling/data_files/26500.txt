 I'm with a man and a woman going to a hotel for one night. We must draw a map for our driver so he knows how to get to the airport in the morning so we can catch our flight to Australia. We have a city map of Melbourne. We take it out and give directions: Take highway 19 into Melbourne to the airport. Then we drive in a large limousine-like vehicle. We arrive at a large, fancy hotel. I am with my friend Matt Yams in the Grocery Getto parking lot in Oak Valley. We have driven a small car there and parked in the northeast corner of the lot near the bus stop. There is a van parked to our right, and a car to our left. Matt has gone in the store. I need to urinate. I look to do this by the car, shielding myself from view. The people driving the van return to their vehicle and drive away. Matt comes out of the store looking very clean. He has showered and is wearing a white shirt with a blue apron. We're in a hotel room bathroom. There are a few inches of dirty, soapy water draining out of the bathtub. I ask Matt if that was from his shower. He says yes. I pick up a nice washcloth and some large bars of soap to take with me. There are five or six bars of soap around; I take three or four of them. I ask Matt what time we're getting up in the morning. He says half past six. I say, "6:30?" He says yes. I figure that gives us one and a half hours to get to the airport, which is plenty of time. We seem to need to be there at 7:00 or 5:00am. I'm in the break room at Grocery Getto. I quit my job there, along with another man. The man has some stuff in his locker that belongs to another employee. A coworker, Todd Mohs, is there. It may be his stuff in the locker, or the stuff may be moved to his locker. A person named Jim seems to be there.
