Mom and Darren had bought a new place, but it was like a caravan and had no rooms. 'Bedrooms' were now a bed in a box, as in, a small walled up part of it had a bed inside (just a bed) and drawers were on the outside for clothes. I said I'd rather kill myself than not have a bedroom, saying that if there was no room for a desk then it wasn't worth it. I was wandering around outside at some point and there was a fluffy grey cat on some stairs. I walked past it and then it jumped up at me from behind and started strangling me. I managed to get it off and ran back inside.
