["Baby and paralyzed man"]  I am in someone's house. A couple. The man is paralyzed. The woman he is married to is young pretty and cold. There is a baby. I am helping to take care of the baby. I try to fold it up in my arms but it's legs and arms keep poking out. I finally get the baby comfortable. I think my mother is there somewhere watching critically. The man calls me into his bedroom. It has a fireplace, a nice overstuffed chair and a couch. He is lying on the couch. He is attracted to me. The woman is watching jealously. I feel caught in the middle.
