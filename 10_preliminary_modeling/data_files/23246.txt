It is the first week of classes at the university where I worked.  It is the day of our faculty meeting, and I have forgotten to notify everyone of it.  I put out a notice quickly and go get something for lunch.  I realize I haven't been distributing attendance sheets, and I decide that we will just be informal about assessing attendance; our teaching staff is somewhat smaller than usual, and I am confident that we will have to neither add teachers nor lay off anyone.  The part about lunch is very confusing; it is spatial-patterned in nature, not logical and linear-something about a classical painting and a division into seats in a lunchroom.  After this it becomes clearer:  I am heading back to the office, with a couple of pillows.  I follow a route, apparently a shortcut, that will take me through another building.  To reach the door to this building, I have to climb a long set of very steep steps, the top step of which is unusually high.  There are a lot of people waiting in line on these steps.  When I get near the top, the door opens, and a guy tells us that the Government Department, or the School of Government, is closed today and we can't come in.  Many of the people complain, and I tell them that I just want to pass through on my way to my office in another department, but they won't let me.  It is really frightening to go back down these steep steps, and when I get to the bottom, I realize that I have left my pillows up there.  Reluctantly, I go back up the steps to get them.  At the top, some women are working on a piece of cloth-maybe sewing, perhaps stitching a quilt.  As I start to go back down, my feet get tangled in this cloth and I trip and fall all the way down the stairs-not bouncing on the steps but falling past them.  To my relief, I am not hurt when I reach the bottom.
