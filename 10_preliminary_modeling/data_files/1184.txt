I go into a bedroom. I see a man I kind of like through the window. I close the curtains. I feel sexually turned on. I thumb tack the curtains shut, very carefully, and go to the bed and experience a quick orgasm. Then I am some "wonder" creature and I am patrolling the outside of the school building. A terrible mean creature threatens me. He's after me. He grows tall in his attempt to catch me as I fly up very rapidly to keep out of his dangerous reach. I go very high very fast. All I can see is the tip of his huge finger as he rushes up to get me. My only hope is to out last him. We hit rarified air; we're nearly out of atmosphere. He finally weakens and crumbles out of sight. I am relieved because I was at the end of my endurance. I fly/fall back down keeping a wary eye open in case. Then I'm being wheeled to the stadium where I'll entertain the troops. I pass a barrack. There is a sign in the window. It says "Star." I hear the guys talking about how if the light is on, they can come talk to the star, if not, then she doesn't want company. They really hope the light will be on. I feel smug because unbeknownst to them, I am the star, and the light will be on!
