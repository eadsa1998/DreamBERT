I go to visit a former neighbor woman and enter by the side door and walk in on a male guest who is in the bath tub and a boy in the bathroom. I am embarrassed and upset. They say "no problem." I leave because I feel I should have known better. A female guest in the house, who is German, says there is no need to be so embarrassed. I feel I should be because this is the second time I have done this and there is no excuse for it.
