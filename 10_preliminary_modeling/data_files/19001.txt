A person came into the room with a tray of cake. It seems as if it was the monitor, but I can't remember. The content of the dream just didn't seem to be present in my awake state. It was almost as if I was expecting to be awoken any minute. It's sitting right at the back of my mind what I was dreaming about, but I can't remember it now. I was driving down a highway and apparently I was driving pretty fast and the next thing I knew I was behind a policeman who looks more like a county sheriff. The location I don't know where. I sort of stopped fast and felt sure the policeman was going to stop me. At that time a Jaguar went by fast so the policeman went after him. I almost went off the side of the road because I almost ran into a small island on a turn. There was someone with me, but who it was I don't know. I don't have any idea. The content does not seem real in the sense that it is just not plausible, and I have no idea where it was at.
