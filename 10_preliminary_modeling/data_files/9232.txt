I was creating a member database for SAID using Excel. It had something to do with finances. I questioned the need for this since we already have a member database, yet had a feeling that it was important. I decided that I should tell Reid W. about the dream. [The line between waking and dreaming is blurred.] It felt like I was working on this for hours. I thought I would wake up feeling more tired rather than rested.
