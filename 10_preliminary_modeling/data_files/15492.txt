I was at Nana's. I got splinters in my hand and 3 on the edge of my left thumb. There weren't any tweezers because she had 'sold them at 11.45'. I found some big, dull tweezers and tried to get them out of my hand. They were under raised skin and it was easy to grab the edge and the splinters would just slide out.
