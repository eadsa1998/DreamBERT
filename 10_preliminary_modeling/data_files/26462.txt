 I'm at my dad's old house with my brother Wally, friends Nat Miller, Sarah Reed, and another woman. It is nearly 2:00am. I'm watching television on the couch. I talk to Wally, who is on the porch. We exchange some odd glances and some short comments. We may have a cookout tonight. I talk to him about what we'll need for it. The television show ends at 2:00am. Nat and I get up from the couch. Sarah has left but may return later. The other woman may ask if we need to go to the store. I say Nat and I will go and get charcoal and food for a barbeque. Wally says that it's going to be difficult staying up until 3:00am for this barbeque and then waking up at 6:00am. I say I won't be getting up at six, but sleeping until 1:00pm! The others will have to get up. I walk outside. From the window, Nat says that it looks like a tornado/funnel cloud. I look westward. The sky is light colored, yellow and stormy. I think it would be a good idea to light the barbeque before we go to the store so it's ready when we return. I look for the grill. I find short small round grill next to the base of the tree near the shop. I pick up the square grill grate that is on the ground. I hear a voice in the shop, but notice no light is on there. I walk over to the shop door with the thick iron grate as a weapon. I kick the door, making a loud thud sound to scare the intruders. My dad and the other woman emerge. They're going to light the grill. I thought they were intruders.
