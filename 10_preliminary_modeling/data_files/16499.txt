I was babysitting a kid named Joey, and I think it came from a Joey that Mom used to babysit. But this Joey was a toddler, and he had like two other kids running around and they were girls. And they had a keyboard in their room. It was a few more octaves than the Music Major, but it was kind of similar. And it came with these little figures of girls with instruments that you had to stand on the, you know, the top ledge above where the keys are. And they were just little things that came with it, and they each had a story. You know, the plastic like the Easter rabbit that comes on top of those candy things? Well, it was kind of like that. There was a tall, slender -- and these were about 4 or 5" high -- there was a tall, slender Caucasian woman in a pink dress, like a prom dress, with a flute. And then there was a short, kind of fat black girl with a trumpet. And there was sort of a brownish gray in-between person with some kind of harp thing. And there was somebody else with a French horn that was like a little boy. And they had a storybook that went along, and as you read the story, you were supposed to play the part of each character and you were supposed to change to their particular patch sound. And the kids and I were trying to do this. It was kind of funny, but the kids and I were trying to do this, and I don't remember if we ever got through it, but it was something along, "Here comes Latisha; she's ready to see her." And then "doot, do, doot, do, do" and "Now, here comes the other one. She's a little more shy, doot, do, doot, do, do," or something like that. And I don't remember anything more.
