I decorated this room. I simply had to move my hands in different ways and the colors and the patterns on the walls would change. Sometimes I had trouble getting them to change so someone else would do it for me. One time I wanted to change it back because I didn't like the new look, but I was having trouble doing so. Someone else helped me. There was a bed in this room that seemed to be enclosed by fabric and several steps up from the floor. You had to go up a few steps and then part the curtains/fabric to climb into the bed. The colors were so bright, vivid, and beautiful. There were lots of gold and silver shiny things like stars and such.
