First of all, I remember two things in the dream that weren't related to anything. A front yard of a neighbor to My school, and a HUGE building that my dad drove me to that was some kind of palace. The person of importance there had a collection of big TinTin postcards hanging on a low wall. But the main part of the dream was that in P.E. we studied the first Olympics. Each of us got a randomly chosen sport, and I got the marathon. I had to draw a picture of a person running it. For some reason, I wanted to draw them holding a torch, but I woke up after my first try which looked like this: (picture). Setting: At school, at the palace, and on the neighbor's front lawn. Characters: My dad - drove to the palace for a work related reason. Person of importance - liked Tintin. I didn't know him, but he looked like Nestor, Captain Haddock's butler. Feelings and Thoughts: Frustrated, amazed. It was very confusing.
