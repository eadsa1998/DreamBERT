I was at a beach with Mom and Rover. There were huge waves. This lady was doing some thing where no dogs were allowed. I had my period so didn't do it today. Then I was running from Mom and Darren and I kept jumping a fence and hiding then when they found me I would run again. Then I was at a school. We were cleaning up stuff. Something I did had something to do with Farrah and I and others at an amusement park. This lady said I did something wrong and I admitted it was me. I helped some people do a project. Five at a time had to cook? This guy tried to leave and he got punched in the balls. Tiana and Ramona were in the year below me and they were young.
