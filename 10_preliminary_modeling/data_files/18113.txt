I was on a camping trip with my mom, my dad, Bryce, Laura, and Bryce's girlfriend.  We were all sleeping in a tent that was on a big rock in the middle of the river.  I got up, and got in the water, and a big piece of prickly seaweed got stuck to my foot, and it hurt a lot.  While I was trying to get the seaweed off, Bryce and his girlfriend got into a canoe and started canoeing down the river.  I said goodbye, and he said: "Just leave us alone, ok.  Tell your mom I won't be back until dinner."  Then, me and Laura started swimming towards the land, and Laura got taken by the current and got thrown over a waterfall.  I got to the land, and my parents were there barbecuing.
