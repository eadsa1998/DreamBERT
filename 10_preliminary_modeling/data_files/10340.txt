Long TRAIN trip with Frank: we are going to Texas to visit his parents and his sister. Confusion about where to meet again; I get angry at him and slap him with a bouquet of flowers! Later we are on a bus that becomes an aeroplane. Frank is again somewhere else, then I see him thru the window and I run down rickety steps and out the door, but he says, "You can continue your journey." But I say: "No, I'm getting off to be with you!" So I run back and get my bag and join Frank.
