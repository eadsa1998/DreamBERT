I was at a mall running. I was only wearing my underwear. I was with some guy I've never seen before. I got to the end of the mall and my church was inside it. Then I went in for a little bit. I saw my Pastor and ran outside. (I was outside my church, not the mall.) I ran down the street to the gas station to buy cigarettes. The counter was about 10 feet tall. I couldn't reach the counter. Then I got carded and I didn't have an I.D. because I had no pockets. Then this guy (14 years old) went up and they didn't card him. Then we ran through the woods to my house.
