I was in a 1/2 P.E. class and 1/2 picnic with the P.E. teacher. It was a very odd situation. We were passing food and writing names on bits of paper: names for basketball partners. All of a sudden, some sort of low-flying, child-created, kid-driven aircraft came toward us. It touched some heads and playfully bumped a few of us purposely. When the 7th grade driver told us he could have injured us badly, I got terrified. Setting: Basketball court on a hill on which there was a picnic table. Characters: Half of my class now and half of the grade below us. The 7th grade driver was my brother's good friend. Our regular P.E. teacher was extra nice. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared. I have absolutely no idea where it came from except I wrote down the name of a long-lost friend on my basketball partner paper.
