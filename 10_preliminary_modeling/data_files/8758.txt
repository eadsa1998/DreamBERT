I was in my home and I saw a man pass by my front window. I immediately thought he looked very much like Vince P. I ran to my front door and opened it to get a better look. It was Vince P. There was a place to park just to the left front of my home. That's where he was parked. As he was preparing to get into this car I called out to him two or three times, using his last name to be sure I got his attention. There were a few large shrubs at the front of my house so the view was largely blocked. The third time I said his name he finally turned in my direction. Because of the shrubs he didn't see me right away. I was peering at him mostly between the shrubs as his head was just barely above them. He finally noticed me. He was with Joanne N. They locked the car again and walked over to me. I invited them in. I did not receive the warm reception I expected from them and was quite saddened by this. I didn't have much furniture in my living room as the carpets were wet, and soaking wet around where the coffee table normally sits. We talked a little about what happened to my carpets. I am somewhere else with another woman. We are talking to a third woman, Lisa S. As we talk I realize that she doesn't recognize me. I'm wearing a name tag, but because of my name change she still has no idea who I am. I finally say something about her not knowing who I am. She smiles and seems a bit embarrassed that she now realizes she should know me. Myself and the other woman start giving her hints, worked for her in the city where I live, etc. I finally say, The store manager who brought this very store from a ranking of 128 to the top 25. Before I said the last few words she realized who I was. She seemed very happy to see me. We hugged and chatted a bit. I was telling someone else now about how I've been running into all of these people from my past recently and how much I've enjoyed it. I suddenly became very concerned that this was happening because I was going to die soon.
