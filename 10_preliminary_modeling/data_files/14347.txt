I went to 'Subway' with Mom. I was going to get a soup but Mom decided to get me a pie. Mom said "that boy came over sometime" and I saw Eugene sitting a few tables away staring over his shoulder at me. He was with Bradley, Jeremiah and others. I said I knew them from school. I was wearing my new brown shirt and Eugene was wearing the same one. The pie had almost 40 grams of fat in it and I said I wasn't going to eat it, but then I took a few bites. I got my phone out and put it on silent and changed the settings so I could take some sneaky pictures of Eugene. He had some facial hair now, but it was pretty hot. They then left, but Jeremiah and Mom got into an argument. I ended up going with Eugene and we went in his car with his father driving. We stopped somewhere and Eugene looked around at us, stared at me for a second and I went to get my phone ready again. Then we kept going and we went to his house. His father Abraham said we were welcome here and I could see a park just up the road. I pretended not to know where we were. I was thinking this was the best idea I'd ever had (going with Eugene instead of Mom). We were standing outside but then we were like, underneath the road but could see through it and Eugene was doing something to it (can't read my writing). I again tried to take a photo. Then there was a movie and it had Eugene dressed up as a lumberjack standing next to a good-looking fireman guy, and it was a test for women (most picked the fireman).
