The junior high was mixed with elementary school and had a runway for airplanes. I went on an airplane every day to a vacation resort. I put my stuff in the plane. It was a cool, small plane. The planes were leaving and I wasn't on it yet. I was at school in a big auditorium and everyone was there - people from my new school and old school. We were watching a movie and this boy I used to have a crush on and a boy I used to go out with were kissing this girl and looking at me. They were making faces by my friend Joan. I was making everyone laugh because I kept breaking my spider balloon. Me and a group of people went to say goodbye to this girl. My plane left me.
