[In the dream - my dreaming self] dreamt that I was having a series of dreams. It was an extraordinary number of dreams. There were about ten to fifteen. They were each brief and very different. In the dream I was thinking how unusual this was, yet interesting and fun. I had recalled parts of three or four of them. Some of them I [my dreaming self] took the time immediately after waking up to explore the meaning of.
