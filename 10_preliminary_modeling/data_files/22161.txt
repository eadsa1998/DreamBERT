I dreamed I was a private detective and that I was mean and a ladies' man. I had a very poor office. One day a man named Ringo came to see me and asked me to investigate the kidnapping of his daughter. I asked him who had recommended my services and he said it was a Chinaman. I made him sit down and tell me his problem. He told me they had kidnapped his daughter and were asking for a million as a ransom. Then I started to investigate and was able to capture the bandits. Suddenly I was in a very beautiful place, which was unfamiliar to me, but an old man with a beard and dressed in white came to me and I asked him where I was and he told me that I already knew. I heard them call me in the distance and then I awoke.
