I was cleaning out the garage of the house on Lakeland Dr. I wanted to try to make room for at least one car but it seemed nearly impossible because there was hardly room to walk. I told someone, more than one person, what we were doing though I didn't actually see other people. I started moving everything out of the garage into the driveway. There were many bikes, boxes, linens not in boxes or anything, gift tins and baskets with things in them. I don't remember throwing anything away or giving anything away. I was just organizing to make things fit better. One of the baskets had many little, jewelry-sized gift-wrapped boxes in it. I realized that I had saved those to use for future gifts.
