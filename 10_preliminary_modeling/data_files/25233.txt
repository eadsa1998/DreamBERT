 I'm having a party at my house. My friend Elise Rooks runs in through the front door, dressed in white. She is in a frenzy. She runs out to her car and comes back in. She has a wedding ring, and is getting married. I am with Annie Thomas. She says to me, "I think about what we had." She expresses her feelings of loss regarding the end of our relationship. I hug her. We are on the north side of the garage by my neighbors, the Stalk's, apartment. When we hug I want to have my back up against the side of the house so I can lean on it. I go inside and clean up. I pick up cups with cigarette butts in them. Annie and I are by the back door. I have her eat a raspberry, which she has never eaten. I think she likes it. I'm with some people in my neighbor, the Trammell's driveway adjacent the alley. I see a UFO, a flying saucer. It's dark and the UFO isn't very well lit, but one can still see it. I try to point it out to the others. They don't seem to see it at first. Three more UFO's fly overhead. We all see them.
