I was working in a hardware store which was very long and narrow and cluttered with hardware products. My friend (m, 23) came in to see me. We were standing by two huge piles of scrap rubber which were located near the front door. My friend lit a cigarette. Before we knew it, the piles of scrap rubber were on fire and the store was filled with smoke. My friend ran out the front door and I ran towards the back of the store to get my purse. I don't know what happened after that.
