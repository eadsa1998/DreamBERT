Nate comes to the door. I let him in. He looks around and wants to know if I'm alone. I say, "No, the family is in another room." Aunt Muriel is in the room with us. Nate lays down on the couch I'm sitting on. His head is in my lap. I assure him that Aunt Muriel is really all right. I then felt worried that she heard me talk about her and went over what I said to assure myself I didn't say anything bad. (I woke up and started to try and remember early memories and then fell back asleep. I remember two dreaming images.) l) A small white hand covering up a large mouth in a purple face, so they can't speak, and 2) three baby birds feeding a very fat, round mama bird.
