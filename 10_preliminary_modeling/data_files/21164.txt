There was a lot of snow on the ground and it was hard driving. My car didn't want to start, but it finally did. I dumped some beans and small piece of butter on the ground out of a kettle. The girls were going to have dinner. They were preparing it. I threw three pairs of socks into the stove because my sister Mary cut the tops off when she was to cut off the labels only. Floating in the air, I was doing some stunts for the dinner party in the sunshine. Barbara got hold of my legs and pulled me down always, so I hit her on her legs till she let me alone. I went into the clothes closet that we had in PA. and took a good look into it. It was larger and there were a lot of clothes hanging in there. I had on two sets of clothes on myself. At first I just had a gym shirt on, not dressed properly.
