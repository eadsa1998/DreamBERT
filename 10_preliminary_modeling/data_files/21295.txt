We had an election. There were a lot of Masons at the election. The masons put over a crooked election and they were elected and they seized the arms and with a strong arm they took over the government. We were separated from our children, also from our wives. We all lived alone with a brother Mason who kept a guard over what we did. Everything was curtailed, even our religion. We sat in the open and had our hats on. I saw guards walk thru the streets drunk. They would abuse the people as they went by. It was hell. My wife was coming over to see me. I was afraid for her safety if the government would find out because it would be a severe punishment to her. I saw one Mason rent collector. He tortured a tenant for more rent till the poor man gave it to him. This was a sad country under their rule. I was in Rivertown with Bill Kotnik. I showed him where I lived in Rivertown. It was next door to a church. As we walked away, I looked to see if the church had a cross on and it had a paper cross pasted on the building.
