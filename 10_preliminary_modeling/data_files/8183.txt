I was going on a trip with a bunch of people I know. Maybe fellow students or maybe a business trip. I'm not sure which. The place we were staying was circular in shape and there were three floors and the to get to the floors it's like we were in the center. It wasn't all that big and kind of went to the outer edge of the circle. I don't know exactly how to explain it. It's like you kind of had to lie down on your back and slide through this opening to get to the hallway that led into the guest rooms. We had gotten to this place by bus. I was one of the last ones off the bus so most of the first floor rooms were gone when I got there. I had gone into a room and was thinking about just taking that room. It wasn't like a normal hotel where they assign you a room when you check in. While I was in there looking at this room someone else came in and just started unpacking. So I had to try to find another room. It was kind of difficult how you had to go through this opening to go to the different rooms. I did the same thing at the second floor and I found a room or two but for some reason I didn't like them and I didn't want to go up to the third floor. The second and third floor rooms were more difficult to get to than the first floor. I ended up going to someone in charge and explaining that I am really uncomfortable on the second and third floor. I explained what happened when I was in the one first floor room and someone else just came in and started unpacking. They said they normally reserve a couple of the first floor rooms for emergencies. They are nicer rooms than any of the others. They felt that this was a situation that warranted them giving me one of those rooms.
