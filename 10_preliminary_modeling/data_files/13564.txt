I was watching an early season of 24. Jack was looking for information. This money had been passed down for 200 odd years. Someone told him something about his son and it looked like he was going to steal it. People started shooting at Jack. Then Jack was driving a car down a road that was 'cliff-like'. This girl he worked with was driving behind him, guiding him. Then this guy, that girl and I were at this forest thing. They were bad guys. Jack was hiding somewhere. There was a thick bushy area a thin area. The girl downloaded a map and told us to take the thin area. I figured she was going to kill us and walked slowly. She was pointing a gun at us and I yelled out "Kiefer!" and she looked shocked. I managed to get out of sight and was making my way around this fence. She was like "I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die!" and I was waiting for her to point the gun at me. Then she did and I woke up.
