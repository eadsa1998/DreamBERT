There was a queen contest. I was the Queen of 0-- and one of my M-- friends was Queen of N.E. M-- &amp; S.W. C-- which was the most important "queenship." We were to step forward on the stage, state our name &amp; territory. She, the most important queen, stuttered &amp; faltered. When my turn came I was stately &amp; regal. After the program we assembled downstairs in an auditorium. There were many photographers and several "drug store cowboy" type of boys. One said of me, "She is cute, but I bet she's thirty if she's a day." My former roommate was there &amp; I told her of seeing the man in whom I had been interested. She told me her friends at school didn't like my future sister-in-law, and why had I given her such a buildup? (They've never met her) I said I hadn't. I was eating dark bread &amp; marmalade &amp; offered her some. The bread slice was so thick she had to cut it through the center. I said, "here, take the piece with more bananas on it &amp; there appeared small slices of banana on the bread. There were more confused parts that I can't remember.
