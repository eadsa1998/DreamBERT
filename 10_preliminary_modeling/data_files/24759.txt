I was walking down the steps to a garden, talking to a little boy who was telling me he didn't have a horse, even though I knew he did. Somebody started chasing us, and this little man snapped his finger and a taxicab appeared in the driveway of the mansion. Me, the man and the boy drove away. Setting: Going down some steps to a garden, and in the driveway of a mansion. Characters: A boy, a little man, and a bigger man. I don't know any of them. Feelings and Thoughts: Confused. I think the dream was made up of things that had happened that day.
