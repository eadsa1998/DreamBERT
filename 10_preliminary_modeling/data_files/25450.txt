 I'm at the apartments by the Deer Theatre in Oak Valley. There is a black boy there. His white boss, who is racist, has hurt him. He may have been shot. I help the boy escape and get away from the boss. I'm over by Oak Valley Bank. There is a warehouse with a stack of wooden pallets and a power jack there. I am working for Pepsi. A head honcho for Pepsi whose name is Shapiro comes by. He sees that I'm not doing much work but that's okay with him. My friend Kevin Simpson operates a forklift. There are two Asian boys there. One of them is named John, and I know him from working at the Brimson Library. I chase the boys, and fight them. I stab one of them in the bottom of the foot through the shoe with my Swiss Army knife. I say, "I don't want to kill no one! That's fucked up!" I have cut the boy and he is bleeding, and blood is everywhere. <br/
