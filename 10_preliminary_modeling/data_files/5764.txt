[1997-06-17] I was in a hotel room with a friend of mine I think his name was JM that I knew years ago. I was sitting on the bed and he was on the other side of the room to my right as I was facing him. He was over where the bathroom would typically be, over by the door of the hotel room. Somebody came in and brought a pistol and said: "Now that you have this job that you have, you're going to have to carry this pistol and I'm going to have to teach you how to use it, and I want to teach you all the safety features, teach you how to carry it properly and teach you how to get it out quickly in case you need it because you know that that could happen."
