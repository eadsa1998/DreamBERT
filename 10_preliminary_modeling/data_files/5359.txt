I dreamed that Pauline and I were sailing in the pool at my high school. I was really cold. Then all of a sudden, Althea and I were running to Bundy. When we got there, people started shooting paintballs at us, but they didn't hurt; they actually tickled! Althea and I still ran inside Bundy. When I got to my room, I realized that I didn't have my key. I started laughing because Ben was chasing me and tickled me when he caught me. Jessica was having her birthday party, but I had to stay at someone else's house. I called my father since I knew he was in the house where we are now. I asked him to call Hannah to ask if I could stay there. Then I saw Claudia, and just ended up staying with her. Sue was taking AP Modern European history again with a Buddhist teacher who served tea and taught them Chinese. Finally, I was sitting with some Spanish girls, and they were giving me candy.
