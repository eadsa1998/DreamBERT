I'm talking on a tape recorder at a woman's request. We had met briefly at a conference and she likes people she meets to talk and give feedback. 3 men talk first. I'm impressed that she can attract so many. Then I start to describe our meeting. I tell how she was on a bus (in the driver's seat). My 2 sons and I (Ricardo and Rigo) get on the bus. The older son deliberately throws a fit and acts in ways that cause several women to think I'm a bad mom. Vivian, however, wasn't snowed, so I liked her for that. Then I'm holding the young one on my back, with his blanket wrapped around him. He's asleep and I'm pacing to keep him asleep. As I pace, I look down at my feet and notice how well I'm walking and then as I watch, I slow down and mid-step, I'm unable to go on. I am amazed at how delicate the process all is. As I talk on the recorder, I see a cardboard that is really a space ship. I want to go. Someone says, "You can go," and wraps the cardboard around me. I am reading the directions around me. I mustn't read so many books. I should deal with people and experiences more.
