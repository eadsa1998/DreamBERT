 I'm in Australia with my friends Kristy Puffy and Melanie MyDyss. We're going to a bar. Kristy and I go inside, and Melanie stays outside for a bit. The crowd is a lot older than us: in their late 20's. Kristy gets something to eat. I'm hungry. I'm not sure what the process is to order a food or a drink. I want to go back out and get Melanie to come in, but I don't want to seem like I'm ignoring Kristy. My friends Holly Lapson and Jill Banks, housemate Stephen Ramos, and lady-friend Stephanie Peterson are there. I'm uncomfortable.
