I was driving and a tiger was on the street following me. I was with Ann. We had a convertible. The top down. The tiger was playful. He jumped over the car just a few feet over our heads. We couldn't shake him off. Then I stopped and the tiger was with us. I was going to try to knock him out. He looked if I pointed a direction, so I pointed to the ground. He  looked and I picked up a hammer and started to hit him on the head. He was groggy and I kept hitting him, that kept him down.
