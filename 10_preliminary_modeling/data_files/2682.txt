The dark-haired woman has a big bottle of perfume they had bought at the butt watching fair together that was supposed to be long lasting. A leak springs up in the bottle and she pours the perfume into another container. There is no smell; they were duped. She decides to return to the fair and demand her money back. She enters the library. A man with a disabled foot (there are two that work there) asks what she wants. I (now her) say, "I want to complain to the fair committee and get a refund." He asks my name and limps off, his foot looking like he'd been trapped in a ski boot remover. I follow and stand by three men reading books who comment on Michigan being a place where people can go to a meditation conference. I say, "Well, that makes good sense in the winter, a good place to do it." I hear my name called, "Barb Sanders," and look up and see the fair committee walking by saying, "And Barb Sanders has a complaint to put before us as well." I realize I'm on now. Short notice but oh, well. We enter a room and I sit. It's a conference room (see drawing). I sit. He asks me to tell my story and tell what I want. I do and as I go on, he interrupts me. They grant me my money back and I feel annoyed he interrupted me until I fairly realize I was being long-winded and had got my point across already. I Leave. Now, the men are talking about holding their own butt watching contest and making lots of money, but my guy is thinking of declining. It's not as fun as just being as contestants, and besides a man newly married should be home watching his own beloved's butt!
