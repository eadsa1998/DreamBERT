 I'm at home with my sisters Heather and Ramona and my mom. I'm out in the front yard, near the front door. Two black men come to the door, which is open. One of them has braces on his teeth. I have a bad feeling about them, like they are up to no good. They are rude, forceful, and blunt. They are going to walk in the house. They drove a black car here, which is a demolition derby car. They say they have to talk to Heather. Heather comes out of the house. All of us are then standing in the front yard. Heather has given the two men drugs, and they need change for two $100 bills. I don't have change for a $100 bill, and I don't want to aid a drug deal. I have $60. One of the men takes my $60. I want my money back, but I am scared of when they might do to me if I try to take it. My mom takes my money from the man, and gives it to me. Their car, with a trailer, is parked in the middle of Home Avenue. I think this is pretentious of them: to park in the middle of the street. I am very surprised that my mom hasn't done anything to stop the drug deal! The drug deal has to stop! One of the men has a knife strapped to the middle of his back. Both men come up on the lawn with knives and attack me. I am pushed up against a tree, and am cut. I am hurt. I get one knife away from a man, who may be Asian, and cut his head off while he is on the ground. The other man is the black man with braces. I fight him. He throws big knives at me. I dodge the flying knives, and pick one up. I have two knives then, and he has one. I give a knife to my mom and tell her she must be wild with it so we can kill the man. We swing our knives and surround him. There is another person there, with us, making three of us against the man.
