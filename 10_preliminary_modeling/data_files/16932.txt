I'm wiring up a building (with electrical wire) but it's like I'm making a sculpture - in 2D relief. I'm moulding a very soft metal (salvaged from old wires) into long 'sausages'. In my mind they will conduct electricity very well, because they are about 20 times as thick as normal wires. I imagine the current will melt the metal slightly, sealing the joins.
