 I'm at the edge of a lake with my high school classmates Greg Kulik and Aaron Stevens. We swim and wade in the lake. We pick up and look at rocks, trying to define what they are like. There is a two-inch thick sheet of ice on the lake. The water is cold. My uncle Gary Redding, who has short light brown hair, arrives with a medium sized shorthaired light brown colored dog. He may be with others.
