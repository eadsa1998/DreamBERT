I have a newborn baby, absolutely tiny spindly legged and naked. I keep trying to get a diaper on it, and a blanket around it so it won't be cold. I cuddle it tenderly. I try to name it. I name all my previous babies, Dovre Jo, no, Jo, Ellie, Paulina, Charla, Amelia, and Damian. I think of the name Christina for the baby. But I definitely don't like that name and say no. I can't come up with a name. I hold my hand under it's tiny butt and see some pee came through. I dump that and get a fresh diaper.
