I was at my parents house, telling my mother about forgetting I'd graduated, like I'd just dreamt.  My brother Stuart showed up.  I confronted him, and told him I wanted to talk, and that I didn't think it was fair that he's in control.  He said it was better for my mother and him to wait.  We went for a little walk, and I was still angry and verbalizing some of my anger when he changed the subject and said something about his wife Sheila having a martini.  I didn't understand the point, and asked if it meant she was losing her faith as a Jehovah's Witness.  Apparently it meant she was losing her motivation in life, that she was depressed.
