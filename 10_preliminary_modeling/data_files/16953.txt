Work colleague Juan and I are about to release a product, but there's a rival. His office is in a large complex of buildings like a city, all connected. It's like a university campus. The dream has a film-like quality. Juan and I criticize the competitor. We meet with a PR person or a journalist. We walk through a playground discussing the marketing of our product. Juan has put a 'theme tune' together - but I'm not sure about it. Later, I'm trying to find my way through a vast complex of lecture theatres and corridors of this very plush university. The building has real history and character to it. There are carved wooden panels that may be from the 1930s. I'm completely lost.
