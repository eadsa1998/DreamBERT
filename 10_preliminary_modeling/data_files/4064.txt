["Pleasant Ghosts"]  I am in a house. Apparently, I bought it. My relatives are helping me move in. Uncle Lionel comes in the back door with some things. I say, put them in the refrigerator. He goes to a side room I have not explored yet. I say, no, not that room. The kitchen. I then go into the room to see what's in there. There is a second room beyond that one. I look around, pleasantly surprised to see old beautiful curio cabinets, with dark woods and curved glass. Two of the smaller cabinets are crooked. I see a small window that looks into my bedroom. Near it is a picture of some old man, maybe the old gentleman who used to own this house. He is long dead. As I look at the picture, it becomes animated. He smiles at me. We talk. I go into yet another room between my bedroom, where I can see my unmade bed, and the room with the picture. Lots of interesting things are in there. I see this room opens into yet another series of rooms. I start to walk toward the door but hear  someone peeing and realize the old man is using the toilet there. I turn and walk back into the curio room. I see another picture where a series of faces appear. Ugly old fat men, one of whom has an open ulcerated sore on his face. These are the old friends of the old man. They are chatting about how when his wife died, he was.. At that point, the old man comes in and they shut up. We all pretend we weren't talking about him.
