I was with a crowd in an assembly hall. We were told to file down the middle aisle to pick up articles in front and then file down the side aisle into consciousness. I was tickled by that phrase "into consciousness." After I received my articles, I sat by a man. I had some tape. He asked me what I used it for. I replied that I use it to keep my facial features from getting out of shape. I said that I didn't want to look like a clown with big ears and nose.
