I was at this place which had all this stuff about dinosaurs. I was there without a ticket/pass. Ezra and Mom went out through the entrance which was being guarded. I realized that if you went out that way, there was a way to get back in. I went downstairs to this place with food. I got a roll with some money that Mom had given me. Ezra got this really nice choc mint ice-cream and I wanted it but didn't have enough money. If I didn't get the other half of the roll I could afford it. First, they were going to get me to help out by 'painting' eyes on a dinosaur figure. I noticed they were making my roll still and I said "Why are you making me a roll when I asked for ice-cream?". They then half made the ice-cream and then no-one wanted to finish it. I complained about it. I had supposedly been in an episode of Grey's Anatomy but I didn't remember. I went on IMDb and they had a photo of this girl who didn't look anything like me. Her birthday was January 25 1979. The people on the message boards thought that something was wrong. It was actually a guy.
