We had an excursion. We were put into groups and we drove up there in a car. Eugene, Calvin and others were there. It was like a camp. I went in a pool which was really deep. I jumped in and went to push off the bottom but there was no bottom and I couldn't swim back up. I waved my hand and some people pulled me out. I said that I forgot how to swim. Ezra was there too. I had to evict people from our group after tasks. We had to 'win' minutes to sleep. I got 70 minutes. I was thinking that Eugene had 8 hours. I was playing Runescape, except it was real. I teleported somewhere and this spider thing attacked me and I almost died. Then back at the camp place, we got down to the final two in our group, but I don't know what happened then. Mom was driving me to 'school'. There were a group of Asian men outside. I said they were filming "House of the Dead II" [note: Ezra had it on his desk when I was using his computer yesterday] and that David Lynch was directing. We had a new camp. Girls had to get this suction thing off of Ms Corbett. Eugene wasn't there this time. Evelyn, Fatima and Calvin were there. Calvin got a suction thing and I said it was only for girls. Some people had colourful suction things. Fatima, Calvin and I were in a group and we ended up in a car with some others. Fatima and two others were in the front with the air-conditioner on. David Lynch had done some movie with Rebekah in it. But it was 'real'. It was at Mom's old house, but it was different. We needed money so we wanted to rent a room. Rebekah was the only person in the state who wanted to rent. I didn't want to let her, but we did anyway. She never paid and kept running off at night etc. I was going to kick her out. I was telling Dad about something.
