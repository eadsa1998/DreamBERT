I was in my kitchen. There was a phone placed next to the sink that is not there in real life. I was talking on the phone to my government professor while the water was running in the sink. She asked me to read to her my 20-page take-home midterm over the phone. I started to read it to her over the phone but there were all sorts of interruptions and distractions. The next thing I remember was that I walked from the kitchen to my bedroom. My government professor was in my bedroom and she had other students' take-home midterms. She left one of the papers on my bed and I could read the first page. I remember looking at it and seeing that there was not much written on one of our subjects. There was probably only about one long paragraph. I remember thinking that my paper was probably going to be better because it was much longer than that!
