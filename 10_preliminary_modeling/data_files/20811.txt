There was a big hall in a hospital. I was with George Mahara. We were discussing evolution, the survival of the fittest, and the poor people of the world. Later I met Wm. Farrel. He said that I am sentimental about religion. And he said I should be more realistic. I stared at the building which I had left after speaking with Mahara. It was about a quarter of a mile away. As I stared, I replied to Farrel, "If I looked realistic at myself, what good could I find in my body? There is no use for it, unless there is something which has not occurred to me as yet."
