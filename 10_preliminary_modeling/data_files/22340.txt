It was a rather strange dream. During the whole dream I had only one position, that of an observer. It was a street that descended on some place (I don't know which). The decline was steep and curved towards the left; the walls were tall so that it looked like a tunnel without a roof. It didn't have sidewalks, only the road. I observed this. Once in a while a car would go up or down. They were generally black. At one point I saw a friend going up in a car (though I didn't see him up where I was, I only knew that he was going up). Next to me during the whole dream there was a girlfriend of mine and she was talking to me the whole while (I don't know what about). This girl is really the girlfriend of the boy whom I saw going up in the dream. He has been and still is for the past six months in the U.S.A. At a given point I had one of the cars in front of me, with the hood raised, as though I had to inspect it. I don't know how it got there or who it belonged to. At that moment I awoke. The strangest thing is that I didn't move from where I was at any point. If it helps any, the dream was in color and it was a sunny day. I had the impression of being at the "by-pass" of Arequipa and Javier Prado, with the differences that have been noted.
