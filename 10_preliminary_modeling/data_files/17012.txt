I'm visiting an institution that used to be a prison that I and many members of my family were incarcerated in when I was a child. My cousin Adrian was also there when he was a child - he was badly treated, however he doesn't remember. We had a look around - it didn't seem at all like a prison today - more like a swimming pool or health complex with lots of steel, glass and carpet tiles.
