I had a horrible dream last night! First, Lord Voldemort was after me and I couldn't hide from him. I tried to run outside my house in the woods. He heard me and went back inside to get a flashlight for some reason. Then I ran up by the Links' house and Mr. Links came back with his flashlight. He found me, so I made a deal with him that if he stopped killing everyone else, he could kill me. It was so scary. Then I had a dream that we bought a new dog crate, not even a new dog, but just a new crate. It was a huge deal for some reason. I couldn't understand why everyone was so worked up, but whatever. So that ended and then I dreamed that it was exam time again at school. The new policy was that you could either take the exam in the classes you were taking, or you could pick up a new class and take that exam. So I decided to pick up dance and take that exam --it was a lot of fun! But ever since I had picked it up and had to dance with Julian, Lou stopped talking to me. It was unbearable and I couldn't understand why he was ignoring me. So for the exam, I had to have sex with Julian. I was really reluctant to do this, but I was guaranteed an A in the class and that I wouldn't even remember having sex with him, so I did. But the next morning, I was really sore and I did remember everything. Lou came up behind me and started flirting with me again, and I was so happy he wasn't ignoring me. I ran up to him and tried to hug him. Then he pushed me away, and I was really confused. I asked him what his problem was, and he said something to the effect of, "At least I didn't sleep with someone to get a good grade. I don't want you sleeping with other boys." I guess it was cute that he cared, but it was horrible having him mad at me!
