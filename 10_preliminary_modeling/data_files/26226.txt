 I'm in a school with my high school friend Gino Teavor. Gino's mother Eleanor is there. Gino and I make up and interpret dreams. This is kind of fun. I have a knack, it seems, for understanding, or coming up with something plausible. A woman walks by us. She is looking for the neuroscience secretary. I direct her through a door, down a long room, and to her left. <br/
