This guy murdered women and he had a daughter. Then it was my daughter. I went to the shop with her. Some work friends suggested this store because they had costumers for her to have some fun. I told her to get a costume and she picked this stupid pink princess dress and I was annoyed. There was some chocolate and I said "ooh, chocolate" and they had Skittles too. They were all years out of date. I bought a bag of Skittles which had 'Tom Conell' written on it. There was a little kitten in a shelf and I thought it was dead but then it opened its eyes. I helped it out. Then there were a few kittens. I named them Spaceman and Powder. We told the girl at the counter to make sure they were looked after. Then there were puppies too and one was small and dark brown. Then some time later Rover had had puppies with that dog.
