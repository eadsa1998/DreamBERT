There's a fire midship. (I'm captain of a naval vessel.) I'm quite huge. The ship is like a toy. I'm standing in the ocean like I'm in a swimming pool. I cup my hands and splash water onto the fire while I yell at my crew "to get their butts over there and now!" We exchange two little over to another boat in the fleet. They weren't getting along. Good riddance. I gave up a pretty white kitty too. Her mama had died, so we couldn't take care of her.
