I was hosting a holiday party and everyone was all dressed up in semiformal wear. My boyfriend was there with me. He went off with some other guys to go bowling or something like that. When I went to look for him I went upstairs and found a girl leaning on him as if she were all over him and flirting with him. I approached and grabbed her hand and yanked her heavy body away from my boyfriend. I told her to "get the hell off my boyfriend." I grabbed my boyfriend and yelled, "You're coming with me!"
