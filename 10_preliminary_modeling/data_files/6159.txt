I was leaving the classroom, and I had a lot of books in my hands. I also had a bag. So, I gave one book to one of the girls. It seemed that there were four to five of them. I remember clearly that one of them was my best friend from Russia. By using the stairs we went down and came to another classroom. There I asked the girl to give me back my book. But she said that she lost it and showed me an empty bag. I was very surprised and at the same time angry. "I thought I could trust her, but she stole my book and doesn't want to give it back to me," thought I. I remember thoughts like that: "I trusted her. She said that she'll do me a favor and will carry my book for me, but she didn't." How could I believe anybody if they say one thing, think the second, and do the third? My best friend was trying to calm me down. Finally she was holding me and I was crying. Everybody looked at me. The girl was smiling and talking to some other girls. I also remember that there were a lot of people in the room.
