It was out in the street somewhere, kind of ill-defined, but in the street I was watching. There were 2 Negro boys playing football, passing a football back and forth. One was, I had never seen any of these before either in the dream or in real life. One was short, about 16, the other was tall and thin, perhaps about 18. First they were just passing it back and forth and then they would run out for a pass and the other would throw it. Then two other boys came, Negroes also, and began calling for passes and they would catch them. So I was just watching and one pass was just a little too high for the short boy so I kind of ran after it. It bounded in front of me and I caught the ball. So then one of the boys said to me, "Hey, you can't play." So I said, "Why not?" I didn't pay much attention to them and I was going to throw the ball back to one of the guys and I didn't really have the strength to throw it far. I could feel even before I let it go that I wasn't going to have much strength in it. It only went about half-way, three quarters to the guy and then I woke up. I guess it was present time. Nothing bizarre, unusual at all and the only connection I can make is that I drive thru Coconut Grove everyday thru the Negro section, but otherwise no specific connection.
