[2nd dream] The two rubber dolls will be nice for my youngest grandnieces. I'll give this one with the squeak to the baby, the other to the three-year-old. "What will you do with the dresses? One is too long and the other too short." I'll tell her that is a shorty nightgown and the other she can use.
