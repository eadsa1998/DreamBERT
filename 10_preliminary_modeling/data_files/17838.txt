We were at my maternal Grandma Jane's house.  I got worried thinking I had lost my old ring from my boyfriend Jeremy, but it was somehow stuck to Grandma Jane's.  We were sitting in the family room, but the carpet was lighter.  It was a sort of party.  I was talking to someone, when my mother handed me the phone- I had no idea who it was.  Turned out it was her cousin Belle.  She was in the area, but was not going to be able to visit.  She asked me how I liked my apartment.  My mother and Belle's mother Aunt Mimi, who was there too, complained about her not coming to visit.
