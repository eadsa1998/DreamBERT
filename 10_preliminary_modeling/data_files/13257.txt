Mom was going to make me go on a date. She decided she would take me instead. I asked her where we were going and she said "Actually, we'll get food at home" and I asked what food and she said pizza. I told her to take me home. She did. Dad was there. There were tapes of top music. There were some dogs somewhere and one couldn't walk.
