It was this morning (exam) and my hair was really bad so I was straightening it. It wasn't working so I put this stuff in and then I realized it needed to be washed out. I was taking it out with my hands. I was then at Nana's. Aunt Sally was staying there. Dad was angry because I was wasting time with my hair. Ezra, Dad and I went to some zoo type of place. There were lots of white rabbits and goannas. The rabbits kept attacking me. I thought I saw Mittens there. I looked at the time and realized we were going to be late so we left. This lady wanted to come in and she said "Oh! I thought it was Darren's drink!" and I was thinking 'I didn't see Darren here'. I had asked Mom for my school shirt and she was like "No way! Wear the shirt with green sleeves". The clock read 12:10, and the exam started at 12 (reading time was at 11.50). I got my shoes and left. Jeremiah was just coming. I got in and they hadn't started yet. I sat down in an empty spot and Eugene and someone were in front of me. I went to get my ruler and this guy had it in this book, which was Eugene's. I looked in it for my ruler. Bradley said to Eugene "... your girlfriend". Dad sat down in the exam room telling people what an acid was. The teacher said "and you're not even a student". Dad said "No, I'm her father". Teresa had this brochure of movies and stuff. A movie called Big Blue Ring was in there, along with Festen. There was something about The Ramones.
