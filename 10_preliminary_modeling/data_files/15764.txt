Work was slow, so I had taken up odd jobs at a place I used to work for/have some affiliation with. When I got there I saw GBCS people and I was like 'oh, stocktake!'. There were about 10-15 people. I saw Esther and she called me Hugo, before realising her mistake. I told her I didn't even know this job was available and that I hadn't gotten any emails for ages. She said she'd talk to someone about it and gave me this weird hug.
