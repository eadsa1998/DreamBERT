I am visiting a house owned by a nice-looking man. His current girlfriend is moving out and he is now interested in me. I take a tour of the house, which has magnificent views all around of mountains and so on. The house is set up to give you a roller coaster ride effect as you walk around. I enjoy the thrill of walking across a wooden bridge between two rooms as it tosses and jiggles like in an earthquake. Now I am washing dishes in the kitchen sink and he's drying them. He is playfully flirting and there is pleasant sexual tension between us. Rena sits next to us and I ask, "What does she do?" He says, "She sits there and looks pretty." I think that is a bit condescending and feel bad for Rena. But I ignore it and continue talking with him. Now he's a very rich man and I am taking him a note I wrote with a joke on it. I am leaving him, sort of to prove I'm not after his wealth and I am my own woman, independent and so on. He reads my card, which says something about "May the Buddha follow you," or something like that. He looks at it and I giggle at him saying, "You don't get it, do you? You don't know what the Buddha is." I take the card to a man in the next room to share this great joke with him. I think his name is Howard. I say, laughing, "And he doesn't even know what the Buddha is!"
