I am at a woman's shop looking for an outfit to wear. The place is also sort of a kid's school area and it's a mess. I pick up a container of play dough and throw it away. The woman owner says, "Well, I suppose it's OK now, but it was helpful to have lots of that when we started." I realize I had acted automatically and shouldn't have. I apologize. She says, "Why don't you tell anyone you were in education? Is it a secret?" I say, "No, not really, it's just that if I tell them, they will expect me to teach and be in charge. I don't want that now. I'm tired of it." She understands. I have a blouse and pants and go into a restroom to try them on. I am in a toilet stall where there is lots of water on the floor and I lay them in the water, accidentally. I realize what I did and pick them back up. I want to try them on to see if the size will be OK and then I'll take them off and dry them out. It will be difficult and tiring, but I really need to know if they will fit and look OK. I notice the button down shirt looks like a man's shirt and the young boy says, "Oh, that will have to be done by the valet. You'll have to make an appointment." I don't want to wait, so I ask him if he will be my "valet" for now and help me out. He kindly agrees. I notice the shirt is very long, like a dress. It fits well. Now I try the pants and struggle with the wet trousers. I get them on and notice how thick my middle is, but the pants will fit. I then hear the voice of my soon-to-be husband as he is trying to come in to try out his outfit. I am surprised he doesn't notice this is a women's room and wonder for a moment if I got in the wrong room, but other women (and men) are there. He comes in, not seeing me. He is good-looking with blonde hair.
