I was working at a hospital. I learned that Doctor C had gotten divorced. I saw him in the hallway, rounding a corner walking away from me. He was with a woman that seemed quite a bit younger than him. She was tall, thin, and had long, wavy, black hair. She was very pretty. He was taller in this dream than in waking life. He was going to whiten my teeth for me with a three-step process. He completed the first step then he took what appeared to be a small piece of white paper and place it between my two upper, front teeth. I pulled it out and there was a blue line on it where it had been between my teeth that had something to do with the whitening process. He told me to put it back in and that I needed to leave it in there for a little while. I think I was supposed to leave it there for ten minutes. I'm lying on my left side on an exam table, facing him. He is sitting across the room. While we're talking I was thinking about how much I dislike lying there looking like that in front of him. Now I'm working, but in a different part of the hospital. There is a tall silver, metal cart on wheels, the kind they use to deliver meals to patients. It has candles on several of the shelves. They are different sizes and colors and shapes. Someone has asked me to move them to a certain room in the hospital. I start taking the candles off of the meal cart and placing them on a table that has no wheels. As I'm doing this I turn to my left and ask someone about finding a small cart with wheels to put them on to take them to the other room. The person said this would be a good exercise for me to learn that sometimes what I already have is exactly the best thing to get the job done. I need to recognize when that is the case, rather than spend time looking for something else that I think I need or that I think will be better or best to accomplish whatever it is that I'm trying to do.
