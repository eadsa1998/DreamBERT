I entered the home of the woman who was my boss last summer. This house looked nothing like her house actually looks. I was eating hard candy when I went in and asked her for a wastebasket to put it in. She showed me a sunken wastebasket in the floor. We went to another room where I was in bed and she sat on the edge and we discussed the hours I would work. It was apparently this coming summer and I had taken the job again for the summer. A Chinese child (f, 3) was lying on a ledge to my left. She said she was cold so I told her to go in my bed, which she did. There was another smaller baby sitting at the foot of the bed (m, 1) dressed in blue pajamas.
