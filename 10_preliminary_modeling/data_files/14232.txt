I was at a shop and we were trying to spend the $50 gift voucher. There was a Runescape dictionary there, which was fairly old. I picked up some educational book. I was there with Mom. I had to go to the toilet. There were Eddie Murphy posters and stuff all around the shop. I turned the corner and saw Midge Ure and this black guy sitting at a table signing autographs. Midge had one ear pierced and his lip pierced which annoyed me, but I was excited that he was there and so I was going to get Mom so I could meet him.
