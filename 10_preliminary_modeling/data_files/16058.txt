We were at this craft fair thing at Jungle Park. How come I always have dreams about us being at Jungle Park? Anyway, I dreamt that there was a craft fair at Jungle Park, and I just had this incredible urge to go in the bathroom and do something really sick. So I asked to go and use the restroom, and I got up and all of a sudden I was in my bedroom looking west into the bathroom, and there was a line of about five people in front of me. And the person in front of me was crawling, a crab crawl on her back, and I decided, "Nah," this wouldn't really be a good time to go in there and do that. There's too many people around. And so then I woke up.
