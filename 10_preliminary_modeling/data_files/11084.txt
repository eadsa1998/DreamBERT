We were going to a big family get together--when we got there everyone was going to various formals and strangely enough, we were all dressed for it. My mother was in a very short fantastic formal. My sister and some of the younger folks were going, but I didn't have a date--though I didn't want to go, they made me come along too. We drove to one fellow's house to see if he would go. It was then 4:00. He came out without tie, hair and clothes all mussed up. I made him go back in and change, then we left for the formal. At one time he asked me what kind of drink I could afford and I told him none. I didn't drink.
