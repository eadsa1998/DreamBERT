Some man and I have a huge brick house like an old mansion. I am making a landscape plan and trying to decide where to put the new trees and where to put the flower garden. I see a huge old tree that springs out of the same seed as three other trees that are smaller. I decide to put a new tree in the corner by the brick wall of the mansion. But a terrible storm is brewing. All the neighbors are leaving the neighborhood because the big beautiful trees are going to fall down and it is dangerous. We decide to stay and weather it out in our strong house. We go in and now others are with us. We go up to the top floor. One woman goes out on a balcony and nearly falls over the edge. I warn everybody to be careful because the marble and the stones are slippery. Meanwhile I am aware that there are spirits and ghosts there. One may have pushed the woman who nearly went over the edge. Ellie says her mother and father-in-law were there, in spirit form because they were dead. I feel scared.
