I was at this place and Jason Lee was there. All these things were catching fire. There was "an elephant" in a tree, but it was actually a leopard. I was sleeping in a bottom bunk. I had my leg out and the leopard stepped down onto it and I could feel its paw on my leg. I was recounting the story later and Poppa was there.
