Mary and I are in what appears to be a dining room with other people. These other people seem to be family and friends. We are either in our own home, or in someone else's home, entertaining or being entertained. Mary is in a fun-loving and playful mood and is able to convey to me that she's interested in having sex -- like right now! I go along with her mood, but question how we can have sex now when we are in the company of others. She laughs and suggests that I try and find out -- and leads me out of the room and into a hallway where there are no people. Then she comes to me, we embrace and kiss. It is a long, passionate kiss. I think she reaches for my penis, but I can't get an erection. I say we can't have a "quickie" if I'm not able to get an erection. She laughs and suggests we try again, later on. Then I realize my lips are covered with Mary's lipstick, so I find a washroom where I wash it off. I'm eager to have sex with Mary as soon as possible, but am worried that I may not be able to get an erection. I wonder if the long period that has elapsed during which I've not had sex with Mary may cause this problem.
