A very small plane came straight down through the trees of Lang Lawn. It was spring and a lot of girls were watching it come down. Finally it came down with no damage resulting. Barbara Ayres, a sophomore here, climbed out. Everyone was quite surprised to see that it was she. Babs left the plane on the lawn and went into the dorm. Joe Warner, a senior, appeared and claimed that the plane was his. Nobody seemed to question why Babs was flying it. The plane was the smallest one I've ever seen. There were two seats, one behind the other, and an average individual could just fit into it. Lee Ellsworth, another senior, told the onlookers that it took 9.4 seconds to get off the ground if Joe did it. Suddenly I was in the driver's seat and Joe asked me if I knew where the throttle was. It was under a rubber mat on the floor. The instrument panel had very little on it. But I got it started in 9.0 seconds. I went off the ground and Lee was yelling at Joe that I beat his take-off time. Then I landed.
