A young, good-looking man like Darryl is attracted to me and  I am to him. He starts to kiss me gently and tenderly. I like it. Then we are in the back seat and he leans back and says, "Before we go any further, we have to talk." He says he has some concerns about being full-time around my children, especially at breakfast time. I agree. I say, "When they were little, I used to count the days when they'd be old enough to get their own breakfast. Was I a terrible mother? But now that they are grown, it's easier. But it's still hard, I know." I continued, "I know that breakfast isn't the only issue. It's the children in general." He agrees.
