I am a man and work for a woman in a bank. She wants revenge on me for something she thinks I did. She pretends to be helpful and wants to publish my children's books. She creates a special book where the character is made into a doll and attached to the front cover of the book. But she comes back and says she needs some money to get it started and then will give it back soon. I empty my savings account and pay it. She smiles meanly because she's got me now. I'm basically a nice guy and she's starting to feel bad about what she's done to me. Now it's time to leave work and now I'm me, a woman. I join a huge crowd of people from Community College. I have my violin and play harmonizing notes with the singing crowd. I was asked to join the music department's violin group by Barbara, but don't think I'm good enough. I see Claude up ahead. He's riding a horse. I want to hang around him but the horse keeps stepping on my foot. I have to back away. Claude says he's going to the barn and rides on ahead. Now I see huge groups of people marching from another direction. We all meet at an intersection. One group announces their name and says they are really called "The Almost Political Marching Group." We laugh at their joke. The violin group is way behind in the crowd. We turn a corner and I run ahead to find a place to be. I see a door up ahead and think it's the barn and go in, looking for Claude. I hear him in there and see lambs cavorting around and then I decide to leave. I go back and see the violin group seated. I join them and they are luckily playing the Hungarian Dance #5 and I play along, amazed I can remember it so well and can still manage to play with my fingers as they are. It is fun.
