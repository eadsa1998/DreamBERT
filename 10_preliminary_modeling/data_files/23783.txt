My Uluri [a sex toy I invented while with Lynn] was in production.  I had gotten it on the market and some sales, and now many were being produced.  I went to see production.  I watched a young woman making one.  But they were making them without my ok on some details.  Like they had started too early before I got to specify and design certain features.  For instance, they were just gluing the ends of the cord to the main cord with cheap glue, and I had always wanted some kind of snap or fastener.  I knew it wouldn't hold up, and that wasn't the way I wanted it.  Other things were just being decided by the people making them, instead of by me.  They had skipped a step in the design process and were just going ahead.  They were cheaper than I wanted them.  I went to complain to the production manager.  He was male, and as I talked I could tell he wasn't listening and didn't care about my ideas and my design rights, he just wanted to get on with it.  I knew he wasn't acknowledging my rights as designer because he was male.  I got fed up.  I then went to a woman to complain, and it was Oprah Winfrey.  She was much more understanding, almost comforting, because by this time I was getting pretty emotional about it and almost crying about how they were making them wrong.  But I felt in the dream that neither of these types had the right response to my complaint.  One was too harsh and dismissive, the other too feminine.  Neither would help right the wrong.
