I was with the school at a shop. We were listening to a talk about aliens. Eugene, someone and I left to look for some alien artifact of mine that had been stolen. We were in an office and we found these tubes and took this thin tube thing. The lady came back and we hid behind the desk and crawled around. I ran out in time but she saw Eugene. I ran through the shop and got to a dead end so I ran the other way. I put the tube down the side of my pants and found my way back to the entrance. The lady and Eugene came. She thought we had nothing on us so she let us go. We were at some bouncy yellow and red stairs. Someone said "it might be a dream" and I said "No, this is definitely not a dream". The three of us were walking along a bridge and it was dark. Soon, I couldn't see ahead. Then I looked behind and saw this claw grab some people and I realized that the lady was taking people. I saw a claw in front of us and I tried to tell Eugene but couldn't. I fell and we were lying on the bridge holding on tight. My phone was falling out of my pocket. I was trying to think what to do and then I got this weird image of George Clooney talking. The claw grabbed me but I didn't let go. We escaped and we were later staying in a hotel. The lady found us and she inferred that some people were having sex. She made them hallucinate. Later, I was in a car with Dad and Ezra. There were lots of murderers around so we locked our doors. There were two guys near a park. Some guy was the ice truck killer (Dexter).
