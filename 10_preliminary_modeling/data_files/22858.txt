Some lady about 60, with glasses, told me that some boy had killed a man who was evidently her husband.  However, the man was definitely my father, and the killing seems to have taken place four years earlier (as I found out later), when the boy was 14.  She told me to find him and kill him.  For this job I had a dagger with a 5- or 6-inch blade.  I watched for this boy mostly from the house, but ventured outside sometimes.  There was a sort of wooded area across from the house.  I felt sure that the killer was in the immediate vicinity, but I was still looking for a 14-year-old boy.  Pretty soon a fat gypsy came around the corner and told me he had seen a couple of boys running toward the woods.  I set out for the woods, wondering how I would go about such a task as killing a person.  I thought I would ask him first, "Why did you kill my father?"  I felt the side of my leg to see if the dagger was still there, and it was.  When I got to the woods, I could see a few people at various distances, but realized that I didn't even know what this killer looked like.  Soon I came upon a clearing where the old woman and another woman stood.  They were just leaving, evidently from visiting a grave.  There was a garage nearby.  The old lady said to look through the crack in the door and I would look "right at his nose; he's hanged himself."  I reluctantly peered through the crack, and there, hanging by his feet, but definitely very much dead, was the purported killer, with his mouth slightly open in a sardonic grin, all his teeth showing.  He was about 18 years old.
