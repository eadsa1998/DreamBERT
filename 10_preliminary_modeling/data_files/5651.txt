[1997-06-30] I heard my niece Sandra calling me, she was saying my first name, "help me, I need a place to stay." I said to her "Sandra, where are you, we need to talk." And she said "Yeah, I know, but I'm far away and can't get to you." I said "Where are you" and she said "I've been out in Colorado, but I haven't been following my program the way I promised you and grandma and my mom and dad, I've stopped taking those drugs and I didn't take money from you guys and I'm sorry" and I said, "I'm sorry too, I want to help, but you need more help than I can give you. You need to go to a treatment place and I'll help you get there" and she said "Okay but I can't do it by myself" and I said "I know you can't and that's why we're here and that's why we've always been here when you've gone through the different programs." She said "I know, but I've really messed myself up, I thought I could handle it and I didn't and now nothings going right and I've got to get help. Help me." I ran down the stairs in my [indecipherable] and I checked the front door and yelled her name and I ran to the back door and called her again and I thought, "She's right, she's far far away and I can't find her. I'd have her come here if I could and I'd take care of her but I can't find her or I'd get her the help." The I heard laughter, almost wicked laughter and I thought people were laughing at me for feeling the way that I was and then I heard sad music, like funeral hymns and tears were coming out of my eyes.
