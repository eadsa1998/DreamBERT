A woman is eating her last supper because her husband is going to kill her. She has a plate full of nuts, almonds, filberts, walnuts, etc. She says it's her very favorite meal. I think it's a little strange. I go to talk to the husband. He's had a rough childhood. I follow him into his trailer. He's on a starvation kick. I offer him a salad. He laughs and leans back on the couch pillows. He's not interested. I notice that my blouse is unbuttoned and it's part way open. It's seductive and I notice I look like a boy that way. Now he's my husband and we're at some kind of fair. I am looking around and walk away from him for awhile. A man with glasses notices me and follows me. He wants to pick me up. I smile because he doesn't know I have a husband. I see a line of Santa Clauses getting ready to sing carols. I notice they are firemen dressing as Santas. I am approaching the boundary of the fair and I stand at a T crossroads contemplating which way to turn. I then leave and then come back to the fair.
