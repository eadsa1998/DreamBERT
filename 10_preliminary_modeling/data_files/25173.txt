 I get in a fight with my high school basketball teammate Ron Lind. He is big and strong and powerful. I beat him up. I block his blows. I crush him. He looks dead. I don't want to hurt him, but I will do whatever it takes for him to leave me alone. He keeps coming at me. He is hanging by a rope upside down, his flesh torn away. He uses his eyes, which are still good, to repair himself. He should be dead.
