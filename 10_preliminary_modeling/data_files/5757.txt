[1997-06-08] I was in my grandfather's house in Alabama, and for some reason I was sleeping there. First I think my wife and I were sleeping in a bed in a bedroom there. Then I remember getting a phone call from some guy about a job I had offered, and it was 10:30 at night. I picked up the phone and said "well usually I don't take calls at this time of night, I was asleep." He was very insistent that I had to talk to him and I said "Call me back Monday morning, this can wait." Next I remember, I was sleeping on a table, lying on my stomach, with my legs on the ground and my head and chest, lying on this table in a kitchen. It was my grandfather's kitchen. He was there and my step-grandmother was there I think, and my mother was over to the left of me talking about cooking breakfast and she said "well, I'm just afraid to cook on this old stove, I'm afraid that I might do something to it, its so old." Then I said "Maybe I should go into the bedroom and sleep" and my grandfather said "well there's no bed in there we never put a bed in there." And I said "well yes there is." And he started to get upset and argue with me and I said "Come on with me and I'll show you there's a bed in there!" He followed me in and he saw it and just immediately went out of the room and said that his step son must have put the bed in there without his permission and got upset about it. Then we were back in the kitchen and we were sitting there and there was a little boy there, I don't know who it was. I could hear someone calling him from outside and somebody said "there's your fifta pappy. Your fifth of pappy's calling you." And he said "okay" and I said "What in the world is 'fifta'?" and he said "Oh, its a little store like a 7-11. Its a little store down the road." I could hear someone calling the boy and I thought "well isn't that nice, they have little stores like that, just a nice little neighborhood." [Grandpa has been dead for 15 years.]
