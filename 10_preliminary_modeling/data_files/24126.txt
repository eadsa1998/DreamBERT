My sister wanted to drive me up to Santa Cruz because she just got her permit. I said "In mom's car? No way! I can hardly drive that huge thing on highway 17. " Somehow we got to UCSC by driving on a strange road with many obstacles., trees in the way etc. The color of the whole dream was very strange, a very earthy orange-brown. We got to UCSC, but it wasn't really. Then me and my family went through all these different buildings throughout the town. The only one I remember is a gymnastic place for little kids. I came in and was just walking around. I left in a door on the other side of the building and found my family back at where we drove to earlier. Somehow the room we were in "swallowed" my little sister (almost 16) and brother (12). They were underneath the floor boards, and I could only hear my sister yelling for help. The floor was kind of rolling back and forth just like you can move a piece of wood in your hands. I felt like I could save them but it would be hard. My mom was also there but she wasn't helping. Somehow, magically, a piece of the floor opened and my sister and brother came up. I don't remember the rest or how they came up exactly.
