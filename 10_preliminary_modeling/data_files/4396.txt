["Charla doesn't like my nagging."] I am at a neighbor's yard, looking at the garage sale items. I see several single beds I consider. Then I find a trellis with a pretty plant growing on it. I buy that and go down the street to my house. I hang it up on a wall of a garage there. It slips and falls, catching on a rough spot on the wall. It's OK there. Then I see Charla has broken the plant up into small pieces. I wonder if the plant will die that way. The purple blossoms are pretty. I am sad they may die. Then I ask Charla to go to the store with me so we can have a chance to talk. She doesn't want to go. I am annoyed, saying fine, then I'll go myself. I walk down the street, coming to a steep downhill with snow on it. I skid to a stop and back up, just in time to avoid sliding down the hill. I turn left and walk up that street. I can't find where I want to go and don't really know what street I am on.
