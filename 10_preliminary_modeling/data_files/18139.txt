The dream concerned taking an hour quiz in some music. It was sort of a cross between a music course and a classics course. It wasn't exactly a classroom. It was sort of a long hall with desks and things lined up along the edges. A whole lot of people were sitting there, sort of cramming for it before the instructor came in to give us the quiz. The instructor was a little woman who reminds me somewhat of the plane geometry teacher I had in high school, and her reputation was that she always gave really easy quizzes so you should never really have any problem with them. She came in finally and gave out the quiz. It was pretty easy. I don't remember what the questions were, but I didn't seem to have any problem with them. The boy next to me broke his pencil and borrowed one from me, a green ballpoint. He seemed awfully intrigued that this was a green ballpoint. Then I told him it was good to use for graphs and things. Something strange happened then. There was this big sheet of paper in front of me. It was something of a cross between an actual scene and some sort of blueprint. You were supposed to copy this as well as you could. I don't remember if this was part of this quiz or was one of the draw-this-person type things. Anyway, I was trying to copy it.
