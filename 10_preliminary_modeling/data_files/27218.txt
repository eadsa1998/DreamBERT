The dream first took place in P--. I went to a near by inside ice-skating rink and watched the skaters for awhile. The next moment I, too, had skates on and went skating out on the rink thru a door and out on to an outdoor rink. I went over to a lunch counter where I met my brother (23 yr.) I was surprised to see him--Dream ended.
