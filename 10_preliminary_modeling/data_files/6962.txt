Miss W. and I were sitting at two tables eating. She said something about the strike. I said on account of it, I would have to see my doctor this week before the strike occurs. "For 3 reasons, so I can have taxi fare or asking you to take me, because the doctor wants to see me before 2 months are up and I have had other troubles." She said, "that's a good idea." I was delighted and wanted to tell the other ladies about it. (There was a strike on and Miss W. usually fussed when I was to see my doctor.)
