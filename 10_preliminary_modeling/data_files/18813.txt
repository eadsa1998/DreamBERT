My roommate and I and Bill were outside on a street talking. I think we were talking about a car. This woman, I would say about 30, came walking up and she came up to me and she looked at me, just said, "What's your name and where do you live?" I told her we lived in the dorm. She said, "Okay, we'll be by to see you." Right off I looked at her and thought she was a prostitute, and sure enough, because it seemed a few hours later, she and three of her friends showed up in our dorm. I remember first they discussed fee, and I said, "Well, I'm not going to pay for it." I don't know; this didn't seem to faze them too much. I remember her putting a chart up on the wall. I think it had something to do with venereal disease. Anyway, I looked at my watch and said, "My gosh, I've got to get out of here in 20 minutes." She said, "Well, you have. I guess we'd better get busy then," and she pulled down the blind. I remember I looked at my roommate, and I said, "My gosh, can I go through with this?" He sort of smiled at me and said, "Well, I guess so." Then I remember this woman pulling off her dress, and then I guess I woke up. I don't remember.
