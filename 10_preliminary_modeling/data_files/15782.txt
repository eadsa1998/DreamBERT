I went to my first job with my supervisor shirt and it was for a company that made shampoo made from poo. It was in little test tube things and was like round bunny port but smaller. On the ingredients thing it mid it had something to do with dragons and some exotic creature. Apparently it smelled like poo and didn't clean that well but it was popular. It was the only thing they sold. There were quite a few people on the job and they were all supervisors. Hector and Esther were there. Esther told everyone to mark their names off the job sheet, so I did. Niles turned up and had a supervisor shirt on as well and I was really annoyed, thinking 'this was supposed to be my thing!'. I had a jacket on, so I thought at least when I took that off it'd rub it in his face too [note: This actually came true; I turned up with my supervisor shirt on, feeling smug about it when Niles turned up in a supervisor shirt too].
