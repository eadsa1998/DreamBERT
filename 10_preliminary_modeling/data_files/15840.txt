I was in English class with Ms Solomon, though it was somehow connected to GBCS. We had to do these essays as well as make up some 'this or that' cards, which would get randomly placed around a supermarket that we were stocktaking and then we'd have to pick our favourite and give an argument about why that one was the best. I made one on Bridget Jones' Diary with Colin Firth and Hugh Grant on each side. I made another one based around Colin Firth. I was highlighting the 'correct' answer (Colin Firth) in yellow. The third one had something to do with a werewolf character. I had another that had 'watch Hababam' and 'watch [something else bad]' on the other side. I decided to change the other film I'd picked and as a joke, Ms Solomon suggested changing it to something like 'ants eating your eyes because of something or other'. I can't remember what she said now, but I wrote that down and it was a decent sized paragraph. Autumn was there and she was carrying all the choices. Mine were taped to my textbooks. I decided to take out the Colin Firth ones, thinking they were stupid. I told her I needed to put the big one in there (it was heavy to carry as well) and while I was doing that, I took out the two textbooks and put them in my bag. I bought a few things and then decided I wanted a Yogo. I asked the lady if it was ok and she said be quick (she was still scanning my stuff). All the Yogo's were out of date by ages, so I went to the chocolate section and they had Munchies, so I grabbed those and a Twix. I ran back and she was serving another customer, so I had to wait a bit.
