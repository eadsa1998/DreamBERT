There was a war on. Enemy planes were flying towards Cleveland laden with atomic bombs. I was in an empty room in a watch tower and could see the planes approach on the horizon while up in this tower surrounded by 4 walls of glass. Down below I heard men shouting, i.e., in a nice green plane landing field. At first I could not hear what they said, but I finally understood that they wanted me to pull a switch in the room. It was to set off an atomic ray which would make the bombs ineffective. I reached for the switch and at the same time heard the roar of the planes. An electric shock on the handle prevented me from setting off the switch. Blinding flash. I woke up.
