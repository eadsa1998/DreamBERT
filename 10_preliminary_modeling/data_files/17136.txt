I dreamt of my online friend Marty coming to visit.  My friend Kip wanted me to run his computer program.  I was on the phone, trying to do too much at once.  Finally I finished with the program and went into the rumpus room where Marty was sitting on the couch with my mother and dad.  I came in and my parents conveniently left.  Then we were in the living room.  We turned the fan on; I guess it was hot.  The couch was not there.  We laid down where it should have been.  I was on Marty's right, laying on his shoulder and my left side.  He didn't look like anything I expect him to look like...he looked more like my brother Stuart's friend Tommy.  I teased him that his beard was really nothing more than a patch of fuzz.
