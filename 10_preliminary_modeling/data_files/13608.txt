Mom and I went to this house and she waited for a while and called them, but no-one came out so she figured that no-one was home and left. We kept going around this roundabout. Then she remembered that he would sometimes move to this other apartment so the next door neighbours wouldn't get suspicious. We went to the other apartment and Kevin Connolly was there. We were really nervous around each other and I liked him. Then I was watching Entourage and he, Drama and Turtle lived together. I had to 'make' Drama's breakfast, which was this food in a tube. Turtle was asleep in a bath. I had to feed a cat. Later, they were playing poker with an old lady and they won heaps of money. The next door neighbour was listening to them. Then there was a party and I was taking photos. Some people got a photo with Marilyn Manson. I was driving and I was at a roundabout. There was another guy driving and we almost crashed because he didn't indicate properly.
