I looked in the paper and Lincoln was 2nd or ran 2nd. I was examined by a doctor and he said I didn't have the ailment I thought I had. He started to squeeze or pinch out blackheads from my face and a young lady also was helping him. They had my head bent down squeezing blackheads from my neck and the girl was sitting. My head was down so low I could see the girl's vagina. She had no hair. I was taking a good look at it. Then she seemed to have hair and she had it covered with hair. I was in the screw dept. in my old dept. in the flats. I was operating machines on about four lines. I had one of Bill Kotnik's acme's which was by the boss's desk. I was operating about 12 machines.
