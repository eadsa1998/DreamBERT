 I'm talking with my classmate Allie Crater about biology. She leaves abruptly and gets into a turquoise colored truck, which speeds away. It's a very shiny truck with shiny chrome hubcaps and a lowered back end. I'm on the northeast side of the tennis courts at Brimson. The truck pulls out of the lot between the courts and Science Hall, and speeds down the road towards Whitman Avenue. I think Allie may be driving, but I also think she may be kidnapped, because I saw someone else in the truck and it doesn't seem like her to speed away.
