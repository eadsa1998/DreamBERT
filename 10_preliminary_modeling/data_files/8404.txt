I had a computer document that Bev and BJ both wanted a copy of. When I told them it was created in Publisher Bev said that she no longer had Publisher software on her computer and she made some kind of comment about what a pain that is and that it had something to do with hospital budget I think. BJ said she had Publisher. I asked her what version it was and it was a very old version like 1990. I don't even think there was a 1990 version of Publisher, or even of Windows. But that's what she said. I said, Oh. Well then you won't be able to open it because an old version of Publisher can't open a document that was created in a newer version unless both versions are 2002 or newer. Then John S was going to do some work on my computer. I had a new hard drive to install and something else but I don't what it was. It was something that I have never installed before. So he was working on my computer and he was working on some other stuff too. He got ready to quit and he hadn't installed this one thing that was most important yet. He said something about not getting it done so I started asking him if it was something I could install myself or asking him how to install it myself. Then I think Bev said something to him so he decided to go ahead and take the time to install it himself. I felt kind of bad about it but it turned out that it only took a few minutes to do.
