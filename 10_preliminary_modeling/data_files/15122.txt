I was watching Supernatural. Sam was possessed by Satan. I had been friends with him and Dean in the past. Then I was at university and Ezra, Sam and I went there to do some course. Sometimes Ezra was Calvin. There was a test that had to be done in pairs. Ezra said you could put 'llama' down and then he said "but I'm going with Sam". I asked 'isn't Sam failing? How is he doing? I haven't seen him in 3 years." He was actually getting 90.3%. There was a computer assignment and the teacher asked where some guy was. I told her. Everyone thought I was a dobber and were annoyed at me. I told the teacher later that I had a tomato patch in my room "at my Mom's. It used to be my old house". She wanted to discuss how to grow them and I said I hadn't done it for 4 years. Mom gave Rover to this lady for some reason. We were letting her meet him. She seemed to like him, but if he did something naughty, she would look angry. We were outside in her yard and the grass was soft. Rover ran behind the shed and she went and got him. I went with Mom somewhere and got a text. One was from Jeffrey Donovan, saying "not again". I checked my sent messages and I'd accidentally sent him and Sam a blank text. It cost $10.30 altogether. I said I had to get a new phone. Then there was a court trial and a young kid was possessed so they could use him as a witness against his family. Buster (Arrested Development) had been 'blown up' and we had to deflate him before he could get in. They took off his wrist monitor and then he ran off. Jewel Staite was getting photos with people. She kissed some guy and they played a 'game' with him like 'guess the celeb'.
