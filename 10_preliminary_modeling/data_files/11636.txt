In this dream I was going to the cobbler to pick up some repaired shoes. On my return home from the shop I cut through the playground of my grade school. The next thing I knew I was inside the school building, wandering through the empty rooms. I suddenly realized that I was being followed. The situation became quite tense. Three persons appeared coming toward me. I pulled a revolver from my pocket and shot them. In the following scene I had been captured by the police and I seemed to be very much relieved over my capture -- somewhat resigned to the fate in store for me.
