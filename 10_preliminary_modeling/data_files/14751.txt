I was in the chemistry exam. Mr Reilly was supervising. I had done the short answers and stuff already but we all needed to do the multiple choice. I hadn't done the extended answer, so I was going to do that when he gave it back, but he had already marked that section. I had gotten 80% for short answer, 70% for calculations and nothing for the extended answer. I finished the multiple choice and Calvin handed it up for me. The teacher left the room for a second and Melodie and some others started telling the others the answers. We waited while he marked them. We were all silent and I saw Spaceman and I said "Spaceman!". I was going to text Mom to get me but I didn't. I got 82.5%. I had the back sheet and it looked like Eugene's, and it had a Flickr ID and I was going to check it out when I got home.
