[1997-07-08] We were in Stop and Shop, shopping, but they were having this contest in which they gave you this amount of time where someone would come around and tap you on the shoulder and say things: "Soups" then we'd have to go where the canned soups were. Then we'd have to collect as many cans of soup as we could within 5 minutes or something. Then they'd come around and tap you again and say "bread" then we'd have to go to the bread aisle and collect as much as you could within 5 minutes. Or they'd say "frozen foods" and we'd go off through the store like that. But the thing was, they had carriages everywhere so you could do this thing. My mother-in-law was in this dream, somehow, impossible because she passed away in 1994. My father-in-law's current wife, Rebecca was in the dream. I was in the dream, Mort was in the dream, my parents were in this dream, it was strange how we had to go through the store with a certain time limit and there were other people going down different aisles so they wouldn't run into each other.
