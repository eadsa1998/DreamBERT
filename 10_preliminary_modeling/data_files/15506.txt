I was talking to Benjamin on MSN. I mentioned I was watching this movie and Linus said he loved it and it affected him deeply. It got to 2.30am and I went to bed. The next morning, the chat log showed us talking for longer and he decided to go on mic for about an hour. I didn't remember it at all. I told Mom that we had been chatting from 8pm to 4am. She was getting a cold off me, as well as Darren and Ezra. I gave her the cold and flu tablets. I told Benjamin I didn't remember speaking last night and he said he had recorded it.
