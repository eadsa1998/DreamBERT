Hoyt (True Blood) came through a drive thru. I was thinking that he knew of something? Dad served him and he asked him if he could call me. Dad asked me and I said yes. We organised to meet at some point. We met up and were chatting and flirting, then he came up behind me and turned me slowly around to face him and we kissed. We stopped after a while and he just held me. I was thinking that he was adorable and that I was happy. I talked to someone about animation and I said I liked Spirited Away but no other anime. I watched Ren &amp; Stimpy but it looked different with crappy animation.
