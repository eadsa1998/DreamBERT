Well, it was like a movie. Me and two guys and another girl (my family?) went to Alcatraz. When we got there we just stood there for a moment feeling the wall. Then we went inside to the office and were looking around when a guy walked in. Then he started talking to us, and I had a bad feeling about him. Somehow we captured him and the guys asked the other girl to slit his scalp. She did and then suddenly he shoved us all away from him and his head was one of an alien. Then he pulled out his gun and started shooting at us. We were chased around for a while, when I tripped right in front of him. He aimed his gun at me and said, "Now you can't escape me." I thought he was going to fire, but at the last second he put his gun up and shot at something else. Then he fell over because someone shot him. He looked over at me and said, "I'm sorry," and then he sat up and made some big speech thing and then I woke up. Setting: At Alcatraz, mostly in the office room. Characters: Well, the two guys and one girl that were with me, I have no idea who they were. The bad guy, I don't know him either. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, worried, overwhelmed. Well, I was scared and worried when the guy/alien was chasing us, but I was overwhelmed when we were standing outside touching the wall.
