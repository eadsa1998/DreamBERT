My good online friend Del came for a visit.  I was enjoying spending time with him, and then I felt torn whether to spend time with him or my boyfriend Jeremy.  Then we were at some sort of course for a game.  One 'station' was a small piano and a worm-like ferret, and you have to get the ferret to play the piano.  Later on I was with a family in a large house.  We were unpacking to stay there for vacation.  There was an indoor pool.
