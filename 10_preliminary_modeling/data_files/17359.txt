I was visiting my high school friend Kally and 'Lee' at the university they attend.  It was huge.   The room was open, twice the size of our dorm room.  There were a few steps down into the middle of the room where they slept.  They were in the middle.  There were holes in the walls where you could see beyond into the rooms of others, on both sides, boys and girls both.  I was surprised at the lack of privacy and Kally explained that if the whistle was blown, they could swing across back into their room.  After that, I was shopping with my mother, maternal Grandma Jane, and their friend Peggy.  We went store to store. We looked for the apple juice that my boyfriend Jeremy had gotten at the Italian restaurant the other night.  In the last store, we were shopping for my mother's godsons the Swenson triplets, and they came running through.  A guy banged the bathroom stall door into my nose and was mean about it.  I tried to dry my hands and an unmarked videotape came out.  The checker put my hands in some hot air.  We got in the car and Grandma Jane drove.  We were going uphill.  There were floods.  The beach was to our right and lapping up onto the street, and then water started to flow down from above.  In it were carried many little foam things; butterflies, birds that were headbands and picture frames.  I reached out the window and started picking them up.  I eventually started to release them again, though, saving one iridescent bird on a stick for my mother.
