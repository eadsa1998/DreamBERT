I met an angel at a party. I was really tipsy and he basically came to my rescue, acting as my boyfriend. I had to be home early the next morning. He took me to his house and gave me a comfortable bed. When I woke up I told him I had to be home. He then told me he was an angel sent to help me last night so I didn't get in trouble (get hurt). He then made my car appear in front of the house. When I said goodbye and drove off, the house disappeared.
