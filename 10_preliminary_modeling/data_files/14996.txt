I was playing World of Warcraft, but it was for X-BOX 360. I said to some guy, "I've been addicted to games since I was 5" and he was annoying me. Ezra and others were in another room. I lied on the couch and he came to watch. I went to Dalaran and I had to jump into this hole. Dalaran was tiny and had like three quests.
