This girl had taken a photo of her family and some famous people, including Deborah Kara Unger, in some setting. Something to do with this caused her to get an unlimited supply of drugs from Bob (Seth Rogen in Dawson's Creek). She decided to go get some, but then it was different and he was actually stalking her or something. He ended up chasing her on a bike. Then she was like his half sister or something. She went to a college or something and his full sister went there and looked exactly like her. She went to her room and locked herself in. He tried to get through the window (it was on the second floor or so). Then he was Charlie and she was Dee (both from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia). She was going to help him through and then she saw his sister sitting across from the window (it was like an alley just outside her window, and she was sitting on the wall across from the window). She climbed down and there were bags of alcohol, onions and bread. She climbed up with some alcohol to join her. She said she was leaving and something I can't read. Either before or after, we took a car and it was normal, but we were in America. The brakes were dodgy and it was hard to slow down. I was trying to stay on the road and drove into a shop and then through the car park and there were lots of people.
