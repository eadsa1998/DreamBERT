We are at Father Andrew's in a strange place; it is Sunday or a holiday, but we are not at Church. Father Andrew sits behind a desk and I am holding a baby, rocking, while he records my view on "dependency conflict." Then I am alone with Marissa, his wife, and she gives me some pills because I looked sick.
