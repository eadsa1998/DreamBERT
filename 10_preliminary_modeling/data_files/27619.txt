I was in my room at the dorm studying. Suddenly one of my girlfriends came in to see me (age 23). I was rather puzzled because I knew she was supposed to be in M--. Things were confused I remember. Suddenly, as I went out into the hall I saw a girl that I had known when I was around 10. Then I knew that something strange was occurring.
