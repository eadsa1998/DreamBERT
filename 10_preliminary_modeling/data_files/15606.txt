Magic Mike was actually a Billy Wilder movie with 50 Cent. It was poorly done. I watched it, except it was 'real'. There was a delicious muffin/cake. It was weird tasting, but it was the most delicious thing I'd ever tasted. I was trying to convince a friend to do something with it. Then Charlie Chaplin was a friend of mine. I can't remember what they wanted me to do, but I had to get next to him in a cinema. There was an old guy next to him and lots of old people were in the cinema. He got up to pee and we giggled and I went over. He had a big hat and I took it and put it on. Then I gave it back. It went over his eyes and he had another floppy hat on which held it in place. I had to kiss him and I was uncomfortable about it and realised I liked him. I can't remember what happened, but I think I did kiss him.
