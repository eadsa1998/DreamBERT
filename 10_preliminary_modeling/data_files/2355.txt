I'm at the M City house and I'm in my wheelchair at the road edge, watching cars zip around the bad corner. I see Amber walking by with another friend. I wish to see Darryl and concentrate hard. Sure enough, he comes walking up the street to my house. I get out of the wheelchair and, therefore, I'm invisible to him. My spirit surrounds him like a cloud and I think at him to stay here for a while, "Don't go away." He goes to the house and I look for my wheelchair. Dwight has moved it to the back door and I go get it and come in through several unfinished rooms. In one room, several straight back chairs are turned to the wall. I get to the living room and my parents are there. I say, "Oh, you took out the fireplace. I loved it." Then, I see it's on another wall. Darryl knocks on the door. I open it and wonder how he'll feel seeing me in a wheelchair. He seems accepting. We hug. I'm glad to see him again.
