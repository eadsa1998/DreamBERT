I was at a place that may have been a shopping mall. I noticed two Cinemas. After realizing how long it had been since I had been to a movie theater I decided to go see one of the films while I was here. Each cinema featured three different films. I read the titles of all six but didn't recognize any of them. I walked around trying to find descriptions of them so I could decide which one to see. If I couldn't find descriptions I wasn't going to see any of them because I didn't want to find myself viewing something that I really didn't like or had no desire to see.
