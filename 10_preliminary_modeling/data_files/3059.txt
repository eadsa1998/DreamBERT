Ricardo comes to Ginny and me and says, "Look at my eyes. I'm allergic to the packing stuff." I see his eyes are swollen and bruised-looking in color. He had been opening a bag of party favors that were packed in packing Styrofoam peanuts things. Ernie is around and he is grumpy and angry about things in general.
