I dreamt I had gone to leave something from an uncle to the house of a relative. The house of this relative is next to a hill. When I arrived near the house, I saw a blind man that I know, who was going to have a fistfight with another man, and I got the suspicion that he might not be blind. Then I saw myself with a boy that I had recently met. Later I was going in by way of the balcony into the relative's place, passing underneath the electric cables, and I saw the women in the house telling me to go through the door instead or I was going to fall. Then they continued knitting and I took my trousers off, because it was hot, and I don't know how, I didn't have a shirt on either (half-naked). I was talking with the mother of my relative who is a lady about 70 years old and to whom I was going to deliver the note, and then the relative came in and asked me what I was doing there, and I told him I had come to deliver a message from my uncle. After I gave him the note, he gave me the answer on a paper that had my uncle's picture at the top and below it the pictures of the players in the National soccer team, all lined up. Then he pasted the paper and gave it to me. I continued to be naked. At that point the relative's fianc√© and some other people came in. I covered myself with a small sweater, and without blushing (I couldn't understand why I was like that), I went out of the room, with the look of the girl fixed on me, and I was telling myself that, after all, she did not know me and she might not see me again, and I went out through a hallway into the balcony where I saw my grandmother who was telling me to put something on, that I had probably shamed my relative. Then I put on the trousers, which belonged to a school uniform, and I started to go down the way I had come in, among the electric cables. But since the reply my relative had given me was on bond paper, it tore as I went down, and I was trying to fix it when I woke up because I had to go to the bathroom.
