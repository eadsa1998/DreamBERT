 Kevin Costner is an Antarctic explorer. His ship gets burned, and he loses much of his gear, but he still has some cold weather items. He is stranded on an island. It gets dark and windy very quickly. There are no matches to light the stove with. There are four men on an island. There is a fight with a bear. Some or all of the men survive.
