I'm not sure where I was, but there were lots of people. There was a balcony with a cover. Someone got itchy and there were these bugs which was an 'infection'. We were outside and tried to close the doors to keep it from spreading. There were three doors and one was open from inside (so we couldn't keep it closed by sitting in front of it). Mulder and Scully from The X-Files were there. They tried to get people to sit in front of the doors, but no-one would. They got a girl to go lock the lock of the inside door, but this big dude tried to burn the lock off before she could. I called Mulder to help (Scully was in front of a door). Another guy had a gun and shot at me. Then they were at the other door and I came back. I grabbed a fork and stabbed the big guy in the hand. I ended up with the gun and shot at them. I killed one guy. Then I was in an office with Mr Billings who was writing a report on it. I left and the building was like a university and it was big and confusing. There was an elevator like a vending machine that was always next to toilets. There was a cat. I went to get my bag but remembered I hadn't been at university. I tried to call Mom five times. Then I tried Ezra, Darren and Dad and still no answer. I went on Facebook chat and sent Mom a message to pick me up. She kept saying no and sending me stupid pictures. I had no money and I think she eventually agreed.
