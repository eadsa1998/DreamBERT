Erik told me had split with his wife.  He said that two years ago, she either made him lose his house through foreclosure, or else she had divorced him, and she was awarded the house.  Not clear in the dream.  He described this house as: two story, the 'warehouse laundry basement."  He had really liked that house and was sad to have to give it up.  Also he was slightly dis-ing his wife, which truthfully, made me feel better.  Erik in this dream was beautiful.  I saw his features clearly, vividly, in color.  I saw the shape of his torso, stomach, arms, eyebrows, cheekbones.  I was drinking in all the details of his features since it has been so long.  I remember my parents' presence in this dream, how they loved Erik, really thought highly of him.
