I was talking to this girl I have never met before, and Leah comes up and yells the fire drill at us, and we all run up to the upper parking lot at My school. When we get there no one else is there. So we look at Leah, but she's not Leah anymore, she is a snake. She chases us up a tree where we get stuck. Then I woke up. Setting: My school. Characters: Leah is my good friend but we have been having some fights lately. Feelings and Thoughts: Angry, scared. It sort of tells what's been happening in my life. I'm getting farther away from my friends.
