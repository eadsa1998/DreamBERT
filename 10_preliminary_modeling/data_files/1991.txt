I'm on some journey. Then Maggie has a prescription for an orgasm. I experience an orgasm while I'm seated on a couch. There are other people in the room, so I drop my head down like I'm contemplating and look at the floor, concentrating on not moving or making any noises so no one will know I'm doing this in public. Afterwards I hope they don't see my flushed face. The nurse tells Maggie she came to the wrong place. I intervene and tell the nurse it's really a Birth Control Medication, so she tells Maggie to go to Student Health in the basement.
