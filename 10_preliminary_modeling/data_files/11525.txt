I was one of many persons visiting an electric power plant at a dam. A guide was showing all the complicated machinery and turbines to the visitors. Everywhere I seemed to walk one of the dynamos or turbines would stop rotating. The guide would come running and with a swift twist would start them again. There were all kinds of railings and balconies and no order was required as to where the visitors were to be. This being so I found myself with a few others going up an elevator to a higher level. For some reason I was soon on the way down again. Suddenly the car stopped and the elevator girl was frightened. We tried to move it to the next door below but it wouldn't move; we apparently were stuck. Then the lights went out. One of the turbines generating the electricity must have stopped. I cannot remember how it all came out, but I do remember feeling quite disturbed in the plight which encompassed us.
