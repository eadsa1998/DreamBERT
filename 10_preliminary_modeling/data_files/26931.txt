 Something happens with a wrecker that we have to watch. We watch it move with our eyes. Something is green. There is chart-like paper feeding out continuously. The wrecker slows and stops, and is dead. There may be another there. There is a man in bed with a quilt from my home. I approach him in a boat, with others. I tell the others to be quiet, saying shhhhh. I want to get this man. I toss my ID at him and hit his head. He is married. He is having an interaction with a woman with large puffy cheeks who wants sex from him.
