Two marine corps type brothers and I have polio and walk funny. Someone says there's not much they can do. I say to my brothers, "Oh yes, there is. We can swim." I have Canadian crutches and we hobble to an enormous swimming pool. It's empty. Someone turns on sprinklers. I say, "Quit kidding around," then the pool fills up and we strongly swim many laps. Some snotty rich guy tells one of my brothers he has to get back to work. I tell him go away. We have rich parents to support us. We don't have to work.
