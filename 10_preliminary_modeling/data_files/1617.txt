My parents had taken the keys to my car. I went to someone who had my keys and demanded them back. I pointed out that I owned the car and paid for the insurance. They reluctantly gave me the keys. I got into the car to drive, only I ended up in the trunk. I had to lean out to the left to see and had trouble driving straight. I struggled and finally ended up in the driver's seat.
