I was buying my own house and I was looking at one. Mom was there. Daryl and his family were there (they were looking for a house too). Mom was talking to them. We were watching Once Upon a Time in America with Ms Nesbitt. Dmitri was in my class. We had to write a script of what had happened that day and we'd all forgotten. Ezra and friends were around too.
