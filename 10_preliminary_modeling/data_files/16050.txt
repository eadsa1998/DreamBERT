Mom and I were driving up north. The silvery CD boom box was in the back seat of the car where I was, and we were driving up north and Dad was going to meet us there in a few weeks. And we had our chicken named Loretta in the back seat with us also with a towel covering her. And when we got this to this farm, we took Loretta out and we took the sheet off of her, and she was supposed to go in the gate to the farm, but she just flew for a mile or so, kind of like a vulture would. And then Mom was going to stay and talk to the man at the farm, and I was going to go and walk to a little store. And I don't know where I would have the sense to know where it is or what, but I just started walking. And about three miles away I came to a little store, and I walked in and I sat down at a little counter and there was a little TV there. And Susan said -- my friend Susan, her father -- came in and was showing me a videotape of birds and chickens and things. And then Susan's father started getting all touchy-feely and all, and before long, he was trying to rape me. And I knew not to try and get away because then he would just corner me more and hold me down more. I just screamed as loud as I could, and Susan and her friends all came out from the back of that store and Susan was crying. And before long they held him down so I could get away. And Susan took me to a pay phone, and it was a huge keyboard, and I was trying to call our number, but it wouldn't go through somehow. And then I started walking down the street to head for the farm again, and Mom comes walking up. And then I woke up.
