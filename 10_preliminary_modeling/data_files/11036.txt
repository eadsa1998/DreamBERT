I was walking down a side street in Painesville, Ohio where I attended Lake Erie College. I met J., a girl I had gone to junior high school with and whom I hadn't seen for 5 years. It was getting dark out and we walked in the shadows as we didn't want to be seen for some reason. We came to a bridge and were stopped by a man who asked to see our passports. There was a small building by the bridge and a lot of Negro men were milling around and some were working with a machine on the sides of the bridge. We didn't have the proper papers with us so someone pushed us and the next thing I knew, I was in a small room beneath the bridge, sitting in some mud. J. had disappeared. There were some people lying in the mud but I did not recognize them, nor could I see them plainly. I kept talking about some letters I was expecting and wondered if I could receive mail where I was. A man leaned over a railing and asked me what I was mumbling about. I told him about my letters, which were very important. He said he would try to get them for me but it would be difficult, as he was a Negro and wouldn't be allowed to go into my room at school. Then he disappeared. I started crawling around this awful place I was in and tried to figure a way of getting out. My main objective was to get the letters which seemed so important to me.
