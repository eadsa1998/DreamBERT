I dreamed that one of my neighbor's babies was playing on her patio, which one can see from my dining room window. Suddenly the boy looked at the window and jumped and stuck his foot through the screen window. I was in the dining room with my mother and when we heard the noise, we were startled. When we looked, we saw the boy's foot dangling and he was struggling to get it out , and at the same time he was screaming due to the fright. Afterwards, my mother and I were knocking at the neighbor's door to find out how the child was. We found out through her that it had all just been a big fright. Then we left feeling relieved and calm.
