A bizarre dream. My friend Ralph has frozen his wife's breast milk into three iced lollies. But he has also separated he milk into three 'grades' according to creaminess. The creamiest one is a small knob of what looks like butter or clotted cream, wrapped in a piece of plastic food wrap. There's a group of us out on the streets - we're going clubbing somewhere. Amongst us are Ralph, his wife, my partner and myself, and possibly my friend terry, and some of my partner's friends like Kay. Kay seems to be very 'into' the breast milk idea. Ralph is raving about how delicious it it, almost as if it were a drug. He pushes it on people, pulling out the creamiest one and saying "Just take one lick of that, it'll be the most delicious thing you've ever tasted, I promise". Outside a club is a group of lads, drunk. They take an immediate dislike to us, and we try to leave, but one of them punches Ralph in the side of the head viscously and unprovoked. Bleeding, he runs to catch us up.
