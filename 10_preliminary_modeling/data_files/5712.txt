[1997-05-22] The only dream I remember is a very explicit sexual dream. I was with my wife, and I won't go into detail, but we were talking, and somebody knocked on the door and I went to open the door and I turned sideways so that whoever it was wouldn't see me completely, that's it. We were in the bedroom, making love, doing a lot of things. I was involved in some oral activity and we were talking about trying a different position, she was going to get on top of me which would be highly unusual for us. There was a knock on the door and it was my daughter saying that it was time to go to the hospital to deliver her baby, which in real life, she since has. When I opened the door and realized that I was standing there in my underwear with an erection, I turned aside so that she would be unable to see me.
