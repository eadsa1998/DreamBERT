I was at a resort hotel in the Philippines.  There was some kind of game going on that I wanted to join in, and it was some distance behind the hotel, with a big field and lots of trees in between.  I walked down the edge of the field just inside a fence, and passed a couple of people harvesting something in the field.  The second one, a black woman, spoke to me as if she knew me or was just friendly to strangers.  She said she was sorry that someone had died.  It was someone I had heard the news about earlier, but I don't remember the name.
