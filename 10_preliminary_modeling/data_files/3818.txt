["Japanese Exchange students."] Two Japanese exchange students are with me for a weekend. We are in a house and discussing what activities we could do. One of them pulls out a handful of packaged cold cuts for sandwiches. Each package is flat, has exactly enough slices in it for a sandwich. A paper china plate is in the package to look good. One package he eats very strangely. He buries his mouth in a lump of the food and gulps it down, making lots of noise. I find that curious. Now we are in a room and the room has water in it, like a lake. We are in a boat and a Japanese man is showing me a device, a square metal black thing with buttons on it. If I learn to look through it properly I can see what is under the surface of the water. At first I simply see water as we speed over it. Sparkly silver ripples. As I learn to look correctly, I see the bottom of the room under the water is covered with electronic devices, much like the one I hold. I exclaim in surprise. My "dad" is there and we agree we'd like to spend more time together. We go to Aunt Millie's apartment so we can spend the weekend together. Charla is around somewhere.
