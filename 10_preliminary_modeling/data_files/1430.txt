I am in a class. We are seated in a circle. I'm in a wheelchair. It's in the doorway. It keeps rolling back out of the room. I have all my homework done. It's on my lap. It's photos of me and photos of Dwight etc., painted to look like oil paints. The male instructor is hurrying, packing up his materials as he lectures. The class is over too soon. We didn't get to my stuff. I am disappointed. Chip comes up to me asks if I had a hard time doing the homework. I say, "Oh no. You have to remember, I teach this stuff." I then wonder why I lied to him. I head for the parking lot, following my parents. They are taking me home. I look down at the ground. The daisies or dandelions are twitching. I am concerned. Why are they twitching like that? It's not normal.
