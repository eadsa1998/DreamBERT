I have just entered a building. It is cold and snowing outdoors. When I come indoors, a man takes my overshoes and says that he has prepared a surprise for me. I take a seat, then realize that I had had a dream of Mary. I want to record it, but my recording book is next door. I ask a girl to get it for me. She does so willingly, but only after she leaves do I realize that the weather is bad outdoors. When she returns with my notebook, I apologize for sending her outside not properly dressed for the bad weather. She says it's OK and tells me not to feel badly about this. When I take the notebook, I have trouble finding a blank page upon which to write. Someone asks me what I am doing and I reply that I'm keeping a record of my dreams of Mary. It seems I want everyone to know that I'm keeping such a record. Someone else asks me if I have to keep this record for my therapist. I answer that I am not seeing a therapist, that I am doing this for myself. As I write in my notebook (I must have found a blank page) I want everyone to see what I am writing. The book is open on my lap. I can't remember the number and date of the dream. This is because I don't have my regular recording notebook. I decide to go ahead and record the dream and to put in the number and date later, when I find my Dream Notebook. When I finally decide to start recording the dream, I can't remember what it was about. There are many people in this house or building. Everybody knows me, but I don't know them. The man who had taken my overshoes when I entered was very specific in asking for them. When he said he had a surprise for me, I assumed that it would be something to eat. And when I had asked for the return of my overshoes so that I could go get my notebook, the girl volunteered to go so that I would not have to go out into that bad weather. Yet I let her go outdoors not properly dressed for the nasty weather. She was very friendly and eager to be helpful.
