I was looking up stuff about The Monkees [there was a biography show thing on TV last night] and first the internet wasn't working. My computer was on the table. Dad was in the family room and Ezra was around. Then the net was working and I told them it was working again. The only Monkee I recognized was Davy Jones. I was trying to find some other band, but I couldn't remember the songs I wanted to download from them or The Monkees. I was on a site which had autographs and interviews and it was local. There was one with Al Pacino and his wife was called Diane and there was a photo from Scarface.
