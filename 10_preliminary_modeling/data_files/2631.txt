A male dog and I are watching a female dog as she gives birth to a litter of puppies. I wonder if this seems strange and incomprehensible to the male dog. I see a small face of a puppy just inside the swollen vulva of the dog and then five puppies are born. They lay in little heaps in the dirt and I watch the female dog go to each one, sniff, lick and place her tongue under the tongue of each one. I watch the eyes of one that doesn't seem to be responding and as she places her tongue under it, its eyes come to life and I know its all right. Now we're going to a town. The puppies, the mama dog and I are on the roof of a school bus that the male dog is driving. We have to go to a hostile town to save the children. I'm writing notes on yellow lined paper and addressing cards. As we pull into town, we know we are in danger from the adults. They will "hound" us and try to prevent us from getting our messages to the children. As we drive into town, the female dog goes into the bus and I hand down the puppies one at a time to alternating sides, first to the waiting male paw on the left, then to the waiting female paw on the right. I stay up there and throw the messages out to mailboxes, hoping the kids get them before the adults. Now we have to run for it. We drive fast (I get inside) and we are following a tightly curved road around and find a huge body of water. Our road narrows until it disappears, but we keep going anyway, maybe even directly on the water. We get away.
