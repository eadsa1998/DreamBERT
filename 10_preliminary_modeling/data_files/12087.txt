I lived in a little town. All the concerts that were on were of old people. Ezra had a girlfriend. I got the old songs off of Nana to burn. I was at school and Jake was in our robotics class. He kept taking my seat. In the changing room, everyone was getting changed in the toilets. Three people lined up for one and there were longer lines for the others.
