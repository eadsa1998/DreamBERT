I am driving a car right behind a car that is making the road. It is the command car of the road construction crew. We are driving slow. It is hard to be patient. Finally after a long time it is made enough that we can go on. I am napping, I am tired. Now I wake up and Lydia, Caroline, and Delia are here. I now see the top of my head as if I am looking down on someone else's head. It is bald across the top part and there are big red welts, like my arthritis bumps on my elbows. I feel sick about it. I almost sense relief that I can wear wigs now and have pretty hair-dos. But I also feel bad I have to wear wigs. It's so false and uncomfortable.
