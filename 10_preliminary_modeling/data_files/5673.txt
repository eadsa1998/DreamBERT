[1997-08-11] I was with two people whom I could not identify. It was mainly conversation with two people but I don't know what we were talking about. It was a couple. I was in this place, nothing necessarily familiar although I had a job and this couple was telling me what I had to do. I had to go up to the top floor, and in reality I am petrified of elevators and so I told them that I would take the stairs and they said, "You don't want to take the stairs because they're in worse shape than the elevators." But I decided I would take the stairs and It was some sort of four day work thing. As I climbed the stairs, they started off fine, but as I climbed higher, the stairs became more and more rickety and shaky and wobbly and I was thinking "Oh my God, what are they going to be like when I get to the real top?" And then somewhere in all of this I realized that I had to be in Washington DC in two days although the job was supposed to be four days. The couple sort of leaves. My friend who usually drives me to Washington DC came into my dream. I thought "How do I get down? I'm in the middle of these rickety stairs and I either have to go up and complete the job and miss Washington or I start on down and although I don't remember climbing down the stairs, I must have because I remember asking my driver if he would take me to Washington.
