I dreamed that our house was about to be burglarized by a middle-aged man. I was the only one up, the rest of the family having gone to bed, when I heard someone trying to take the screen door off the porch. At the time I thought he was making an unusual amount of noise for a burglar. Since he seemed to be making rapid progress, I started upstairs to awaken my father, but decided instead to telephone the police. Just before I woke up I was thumbing frantically through the telephone book trying to find the phone number of the police department.
