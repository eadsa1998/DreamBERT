I am swimming and I see a woman under the water surface like trapped under ice and fighting for air at an open hole is the shape of a birth slit. I watch this and say that's a dream symbol I don't want to have! It is unpleasant. Now I go to a warmer beach and I am wading, but every time I put my foot down, I get something like a green frog creature stuck to my foot like a suction cup and I peel it off. I don't like them and try to get away from them. My Aunt Naomi and I are walking in the waves and I hear them hissing and swelling and she's concerned for me like the waves are too big and will knock me over. I look and see they are normal height and ignore her warnings to come in closer to shore. I am a bit annoyed at her for being unnecessarily concerned.
