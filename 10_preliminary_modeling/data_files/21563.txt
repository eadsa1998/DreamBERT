I picked out a bushel of apples and went by Minnie's fruit store and he had big bananas, too big so I walked out with my bushel of apples and bought no bananas. I saw or heard pineapple. I had a shotgun pointing at a bad character. He had me poke him and hit him with the gun because I didn't want to kill him. Then I commanded him to obey my command. I was going to write 48 and I wrote 4 and 4 unconsciously.
