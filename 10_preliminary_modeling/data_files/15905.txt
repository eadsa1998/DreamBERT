It was our first day back at the Technical College and we were in sound class or something. The room was massive and all the seats were on this platform and were like beds and couches. I wanted a bed and sat on it but Frederick and Tristan went to the opposite side because they liked these other seats and all the other ones in between got filled up and I was annoyed, but we later switched to desks and chairs. The other students were lame and the teacher was douchey.
