[1997-06-03] Mort and I went down to Monticello in Virginia, the home of Thomas Jefferson, our 3rd president. He was there and he gave us a tour of his home. We had a chance to meet some of his family and all that. He was glad to meet us and he didn't care if we couldn't see. He even let us touch a couple of things in the home that we weren't allowed to touch when we visited there in 1990 with a tour group of blind persons from [an agency for the blind]. I thought that was pretty cool. He let us touch that big clock down in the basement. He took us into his gardens to see his plants. He told us about them and his travels through Europe and everywhere.
