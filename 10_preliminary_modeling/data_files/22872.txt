Lillian Silver, Judy Seagle, Gail Griffin, Martha Hanks, and I were riding in the car-possibly along Big Blvd.  We had stopped and were standing beside the car.  Gail and Martha were cigarettes in a Pall Mall pack.  Martha punched Gail, but it seems like it was from the outside, because upon examining the pack, I found it to have a small dent in one side.  I opened the pack, and could see on the charred end of one cigarette.  I emptied the pack, and they were all ashes.  I was horrified.  The explanation seemed to be that Gail had gotten so mad at Martha that her anger had burned them both to ashes.  I wondered it if had burned Lillian too, but then I saw her coming.  She said she had been to get a hamburger.  I hadn't seen her leave, so I asked her if Gail had gone with her.  She said no.  Judy and I then sat down and cried all we could.
