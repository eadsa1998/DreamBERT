I was at an outdoor shopping center. A man from my older brother's high school class, Tom A, came up to me and was holding a square, styrofoam carry-out box. I was outside of my car and he walks up. He opens the driver's door and gets in and tells me that he's borrowing my car. At first he tells me to get so I go around to the passenger side. I'm very concerned and confused. I get in and he says, I'm going to borrow your car. Is that okay? I'm just sitting there dumb-founded because this whole situation is bizarre - seeing him and him wanting to borrow my car - and it isn't okay with me. He wanted the keys. I gave them to him so he could go ahead and start up the car. Then he says something about me waiting there or going along. I'm still not saying anything, still dumbfounded. I don't think I answered him yet so he starts driving. I finally ask him what he's doing. He said it's better if I don't know. He offers to stop and let me out. I refused to get out and let him take off with my car. I didn't know if he would bring it back or not. He gets ready to pull out onto the road from the shopping center parking lot. There is finally a small opening. I told him to punch it. He pulls out slowly. I say it again a couple of times. Punch it. Punch it. He said, They'll hear me. Then he does step on the gas hard and realizes that the car is very quite so no one heard that he stepped hard on the gas. He said something about how quiet the car is. As he pulls out I see a house to my right. They have a bunch of stuff out in the yard but it also looks like there is a dead body. I just see something wrapped, covered up with a white cloth. It looks like a dead body. I right away think, Omigosh. Did he have something to do with that? I think he's going to put the body in my car. I tell him that I do want to know what he's doing. He starts telling me but it's a long drawn out story.
