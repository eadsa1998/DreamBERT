I was taking a F-- D--- exam when I happened to notice one of the boys in the class cheating. I went over to see what he was writing and noted that he was copying word for word the paper of the boy next to him. Knowing that a new rule had just been established that all cheaters were to be reported and that they would be suspended if proved guilty, I determined to turn the boy in. (I have never liked this boy, he is a pre-ministerial student at W-- and is always cheating in tests.) This seemed a good way to teach him a lesson so I typed up the report to hand to the Dean in the morning. The next day I couldn't bring myself to report him but had mentioned it to several people. By noon I heard that most of the class had been reported for a similar offense and everyone accused me of doing it. One of the girls included was a very good friend of mine and I was extremely upset to think that she would think I did it. When the dream ended I was still busy trying to clear myself of the implications.
