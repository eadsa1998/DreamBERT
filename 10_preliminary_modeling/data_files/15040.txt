It was Sims 2 like. There was a lady called Julie that moved into town. I think she was in the army. There was a fire at someone's house this lady's teenage son died. There was a thing where you got a clone one in The Island. Later I was at cinema with some friends and a guy who liked me. Then I was in the movie or something and I was hearing voices in Spanish. Then there was a new season of the UK version of Queer as Folk but it was set in the past, like in gladiator times. This guy liked this girl who was married to this leader guy. They had been friends. The guy got sick of the leader one day and pushed him into a deep hole. He hit the ground and this creature was supposed to eat him but he was okay. The guy who pushed him in was like 'oops'. The opening of the show showed Aidan Gillen and some dude kissing. I was also on LastFM at some point and I deleted this guy's play history and then he did it to me and I was like 'flip, I lose my stats'.
