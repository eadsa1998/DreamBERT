I was in a restaurant with my brother and two other male friends. I came in late and joined them there. I knew they were going to be there. I ordered a big dish of food, but I didn't get around to eating it. Sitting on the other side of me there were two high school boys with a yearbook, a yearbook from Curly High School in Miami where I went to school. I started looking thru it. I saw a picture of swimming pool with a lot of girls around it. They were jumping into the pool. I remember one girl in particular. She was wearing sunglasses and had on a two-piece bathing suit. She stood out from the others. The scene changed then, and I thought these girls were from Notre Dame. I began to think about the ads in the yearbook. Then I was someplace else, like the tennis court. I had another yearbook. It might have been from Notre Dame. It was odd-shaped. It was more rectangular than a yearbook should be, longer than it was wide. It had a lot of ads in it. I was comparing it to a phone book. There was a nun there who had something to do with Notre Dame. She said that they had done a good job on the ads. Then she left and walked towards the school. The last I remember I was still being amazed by the size of the yearbook and the number of ads in it. That's the end of the dream.
