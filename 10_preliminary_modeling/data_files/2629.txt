I'm in my wheelchair and am getting some tickets in a packet handed to me. "What's this?" I ask, surprised. "They've changed how they do this," says the man. "Now you get three tickets, you can use them for three events, or two events with one more person." I point to a notice of prizes and ask if I get those too. He's annoyed with me for not understanding because he's already explained. I am confused and he goes through the three tickets routine again, and because things are changed, we don't get the free prizes anymore. "OK," I say, and go to a house (a huge house with lots of rooms). I want to change my clothes for this new event. I'm told by my helpers (Cindy L. of MIUSA) and Merle that we're to wear a special costume. That's what these special spiritual (psychological) helpers do at this kind of meeting. I guess we're sort of like student associates and anyone who is disabled is automatically allowed in free. I'm annoyed by that. I look through my closet, which is large and filled. I can't find what I want and go to another room where several closets are also filled. I comment that later I will go through and clean out the closets and get rid of old ones I never wear. I get my outfit together  - a red velvet tunic, my Robin Hood hat (red velvet), and tights. I borrow boots from Cindy. I'm ready to go to the meeting (maybe one of the freebie prizes was a small box of colored pencils and crayons).
