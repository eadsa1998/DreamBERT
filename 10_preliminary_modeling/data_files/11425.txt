I was in the jungle waters in Africa pushing a small boat. I was then surrounded by crocodiles. They began snapping at me and then I started to stab them. I got to shore safely. I then met a man who began cutting me with a bolo knife. I started cutting him. He was cut up badly but for a long time he wouldn't die. I finally succeeded, despite all my deep cuts, to kill him. I did not see any blood on any of us. I then woke up.
