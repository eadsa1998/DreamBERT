 I'm in the Big Resort Area working at a business that is in the same building as Fishing Haven. I'm outside on the shore or dock. I see a man swimming off to my left. He returns to the shore where I am. He sees me. We begin to talk, slowly and cautiously. He is my old boss Mike Hollow. I wonder if I'm dreaming, but I don't question the reality of the situation because I think it may be offensive to him. I don't want to annoy or anger him. I tell him that I'm sorry for leaving and explain what I was thinking when I left. He says he's in a hurry and starts to leave, but our conversation continues. I tell him what I have to say about respect: my viewpoint then and now. I try to make amends. I tell him if he ever needs help I'd like to work for Fishing Haven again. He says maybe. He tells me last Christmas was bad.
