We found out something was happening in England. We had this map but it was really old and New Zealand was right next to the UK. We were going to leave that night. We went to this shop for a bit and my McDonald's was there. Someone said something about Co-Worker-M-07 and I left because I still hadn't told them I'd quit. We bought gloves from somewhere and we were going to buy more 'cold weather' stuff in England. Dad had to go to some place when he was going to travel. It was called Amsterdam something.
