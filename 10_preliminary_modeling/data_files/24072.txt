I'm at a Christian Fellowship Church on the stage with my band and the church is more like a huge arena, and we're about to perform. We've already played it through once and we're not nervous, but now it's in front of people and going to be on TV. The lead singer is Steven from the OC and I never see anyone else in the band. As we wait to play our song some girl comes up on stage and gets in a fight with Steven and they break up. I go over to Steven and say, "Hey, are you all right, man?" He looks at me and the look says, "I just broke up with my girlfriend, no." I put my arm around his shoulder and say, "We're the Mystics, remember? We're the Mystics!" Then I start singing some lyrics to one of their songs. "There's a sick little suicide in all that we do." I sing it again and on the third time Steven sings along, "There a sick little suicide, it's all that we do, you decide which one's for you!" He's feeling better and I go over where I'm supposed to play and put my guitar strap on, but it's all tangled and I have to untangle it before we start. There are 2 tangles and as I get one out, Steven says, "C'mon, we're live in seconds," and just as I get the last tangle out, we're supposed to start. And we bust out and the crowd starts cheering and as we play, I wake up.
