I was at home which was different. We all stayed up late. Darren went to bed first because he had to get up early for work. Mom was watching TV. I watched some Queer as Folk (UK), but it was different. It was just Stuart and I was like 'where's Vince?'. The lesbians were played by different people. Ezra watched a bit and thought it was lame. There was no sex in the episode. There was a bit with Stuart and Vince on a road trip or something and they were making out in the back seat. Ezra went to bed next I think. We had mice. Their box could be changed around by clicking and dragging as if it were on a computer. They all escaped as I was changing it around. Then they were kittens. Rover was in my room and I tried to close the door so he couldn't get at them and I could round them up, but some went in there and Rover chased them. The toilet was next to the kitchen (well, the toilet was in the room next to the kitchen). I went to the toilet and Darren came into the kitchen and I pulled the door closed a bit. I used the last bit of toilet paper. There were lots of tissue boxes. I went to my computer and my wallpaper was of Firefly, but you could add extra people. I had Dan Aykroyd's character from The Blues Brothers on there and some other guys.
