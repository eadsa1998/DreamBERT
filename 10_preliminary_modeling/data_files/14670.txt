I watched a movie or something or reading facts about the 1700's. Darren said that Mom should take a cooking class and they were expensive -- like $940 a day. I was saying that in the 1700's it was $60 for cheese (like a 3cm size block). Some lady in the movie industry back then could drive and stuff and females weren't allowed back then. I found a photo of Jayson on some social networking site and I was telling Ezra, starting with "Remember Crispy Bacon?".
