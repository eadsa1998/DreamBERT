I walked into school and everyone was in a circle (all the kids) and no one would let me in. They just ignored me. Even my best friend ignored me. I was left alone. I ran up to the bathroom and started crying. When I asked my best friend whats up, she just said, "Go away, I don't like you." Setting: At school, being specific, the bathroom and studio 1. Characters: All my classmates, my best friend. They all had snotty mean looks on their faces. Feelings and Thoughts: Angry, sad, mad, frustrated. I was very upset and angry. Everyone was mad at me. I didn't know why. It was just awful. No one would talk to me.
