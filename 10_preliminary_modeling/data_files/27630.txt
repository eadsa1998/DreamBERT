I was with my sister, Elizabeth. We went on a train ride in a train with no sides or a roof. The railroad tracks are high in the air. The next thing I remember is wandering through an auditorium. I was telling everyone the scene of the play that I was in, was rehearsing and I didn't know my lines so I wasn't going. So, I remember next that someone was washing my hair, it turned out to be a girl I didn't like who went to my Church. I didn't dry my hair but went walking around the auditorium with wet hair.
