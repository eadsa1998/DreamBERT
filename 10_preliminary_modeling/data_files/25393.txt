 I'm in the Big Resort Area with two people, one of whom is my friend Stephen Ramos. We are canoeing. My classmate Scott Botwright is there canoeing with someone. We are not really sure where we are going. We dock out canoe at a big rock, which is where Scott is. He says we're on Number Three, in response to our question of where we are. We have six or seven maps. We've been looking at map number four, but are actually on map number three. I thought Scott was talking about finger lake number three, since the lakes we are around are shaped like hands. We take out the number three map, which is big and long. The printing on the map is light red, and isn't very clear. <br/
