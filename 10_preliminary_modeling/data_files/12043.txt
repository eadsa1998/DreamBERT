I went back in time to 1959 in England. It was really old fashioned except they had this really futuristic looking McDonald's. I met this professor who was, but wasn't, Christopher Lloyd. I was talking to him and I said something about me coming from the future. He showed me his time machine. These people were killing other people. Someone died in this cave and other people went in to find them. I went in to find those people and they were all gone. This annoying girl was asking me questions about my country.
