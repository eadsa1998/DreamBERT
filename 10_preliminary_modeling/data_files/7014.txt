I returned to my room to find 4 or 5 small toy villages with other miniature articles all about the room. I asked the maid who had been there. She answered some men who were doing things for the Home. I said "I don't want all that junk in here" and pushed some pieces together. Some one said it wasn't junk. I told the maid not to let anybody in when I wasn't there and to lock the door if I wasn't. Then I saw two steamers set up on my bed. Couldn't make it or clean properly with these things all around. The room was too disordered to let any one in. Looked for something to put the toys in thinking there must be some way to sort them. Saw some cardboard boxes, one with a picture of monkeys but nothing for these pieces.
