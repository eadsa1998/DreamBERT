I dreamt about going to buy books for school...at the observatory?  There were a lot of people there, and it was large, so I started to get lost. I went in the back to get some sort of sweet raisin bread.  Then there were a bunch of rats, and I felt like I was being conned, and I couldn't trust them.  On the way home, I was confused.  I drove partway looking at a map. I stopped where some man lived, and my father was there.
