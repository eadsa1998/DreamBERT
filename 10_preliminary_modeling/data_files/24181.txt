I dreamt that one of my pet ferrets kept escaping. I was at 7/11 with my boyfriend and as we walked out we saw her splattered in the parking lot. We couldn't figure out how she had gotten there. Then she started moving and we realized that it wasn't her but a larger male and it was still alive. We took it home with us and he began playing with both the ferrets even though he was still slightly mangled and bloody.
