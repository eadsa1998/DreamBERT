A lion was trying to catch me. I was on top of something that he couldn't reach me, then I flew in flight and he couldn't catch me. I flew just so high that he couldn't reach me. Then I flew into a tree. He finally walked away disgusted and I sat in a small tree and a lion or big dog leaped at me, but it seemed as though the branches threw him back with a surprise. He was puzzled while he was that way. I climbed higher into the tree. I was in PA. and our toilets were overloaded. We ran water into them to get some of the waste washed out so it wouldn't pile up inside. We complained that the company didn't have them cleaned out. I was forcing steam into a football to get it inflated, but the steam made the rubber crack because it was hot and the air came out
