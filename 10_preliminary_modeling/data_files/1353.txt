Now I'm in a town, maybe T City, looking for a particular drugstore that carries the medicine I need. I am looking for the Rexall Drugs. I call the operator. She finds it, but it isn't the right one. I try to remember the right name, Wal... something. Then as we are driving, I see two cars, Yitzak in one, Kim and Dan and family in the other. They had heard somehow about me needing the medicine and got it for me. A most fortuitous meeting. We chat. They are on their way to a vacation. I offer to pay for the expensive deposit on the meds and they say no! No problem because they can collect it back later. [BL]
