A Mexican General Reillo is a dictator. He is cruel and harms the people. I am camping out in the country there. I show a photo of how brown and arid the semi desert area of Central Mexico is. But I notice there are trees and a river where I'm camped. I even swim in the river, enjoying the cool wet swim. Now I'm in a hospital bed. I'm exhausted. I want to get up but seem unable to. I am so tired. Paulina comes in and I say, "I can't seem to get up." she says. Why should you. You're still recovering. I feel better about it after she says that. Then they (my daughter) get me in a van (like VW). We are sitting parked next to a river. The windows are open and mosquitoes are coming in, lots of them. I ask them to close the windows. I smash some of the mosquitoes but there are lots of them. No one moves to shut the windows In annoyance I reach over and struggle to shut the windows.
