I am driving home from a psychology class and I hit the wall of a restaurant and break it and a window. Sitting on the other side is some woman who was involved in a car accident I had earlier in the summer. (I didn't actually have an accident earlier. This is all in the dream.) These are the only accidents I have had in 30 years and both with the same person. I remark on that. The lady is very nice. Her husband is not bad. Another couple there is disgusted. A businesswoman I knew from my hometown is there and tries to quietly tell me not to let these people put anything over on me. She was in business 30 years and had insurance and people try to take advantage. She says this while walking down the aisle to go to the bathroom and is trying not to be obvious. The restaurant looks like a store that was in the neighborhood where I grew up. The woman I was involved in the accident with is very familiar but I can't place her. She looks something like a friend of mine with short, smooth dark hair and also reminds me of a former employer's daughter. The woman is wearing pearls.
