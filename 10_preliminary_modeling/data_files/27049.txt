There was a group of fellows and girls about 20 years of age. They seemed to be in a sort of church or temple among older men and women who were there to watch a ceremony of some sort. A man, who was the head of the place, came up to our group and without saying a work we knew it was our turn to die next. He took us downstairs to a small room in which there was a table, a mirror and some chairs. We asked for some leniency because of our young age. He said all right for a while. Then we found out we were already dead and, those upstairs were mourning for us and going through a ceremony. We still felt very much alive but somehow guilty and depressed. Later he came in again and told us our time was up and that we would have to be put in our coffins. I remember being transferred to New York with a boyfriend of mine, sitting in a sidewalk cafe with him but hearing no sounds and then being transferred back to the coffin.
