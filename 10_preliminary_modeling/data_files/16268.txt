Dad was kind of in some kind of a snit, which he really is, and we were driving along, driving on a trip doing something. And there was like this smooth jazz concert going on in the park and we thought if we stopped and we laid down a picnic and all, that would be good. And so we stopped the car and we got out, and we went over, we started walking around and they, this guy was giving out big candy trunks, candy bar-like trunks in this box, and I took a big chocolate one. It was just kind of like the size of a rock. And I took a bit of it, and before I knew it, it turned into like a chocolate walking stick, so I was walking around with it. And then Dad thought that would be too dangerous, so he took it. And we walked around the park and we were listening to the songs, and Mom was kind of miffed because he didn't sit down and pay attention to her. He was walking around and listening to the concert with me. And then I just remembered something else. Before all this, there was another part of the dream, that we were at Westport High School and Mrs. Dougherty was holding a Christmas concert in the little theater. And we were invited and her chorus was going to put it on. And I was thinking that I would finally hear something from her chorus. Well, it turned out that they weren't ready and they didn't put it on. That was kind of a bummer. And then I woke up.
