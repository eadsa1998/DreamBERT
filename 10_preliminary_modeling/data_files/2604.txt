I'm preparing for a math test. I'm not good at math and I tell people that. I have pages to study and I am trying to read them and quickly memorize as much as I can. It's time for the test. I go into a room off a living room. A brother is in the living room playing his radio loud. It distracts me. I am vaguely aware of a double screen window (see- through) where a woman is observing me. She hears me complain about the music and turns it off. I open the test packet and conscientiously try to answer without cheating. The woman or I am pleased, I'm doing the best I honestly can.
