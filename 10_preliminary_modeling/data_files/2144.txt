I go back to V 's farm. The orchard is a forest now, terribly overgrown. Lots of stairs go up to the raised ground. I go to the house and pass two empty corner dish cabinets (glass doors). They are empty. All the pretty glass things are gone in the one on the left is apple blossom ink (the same color I painted my bedroom furniture with in Jr. High). I cry when I see the empty cabinets.
