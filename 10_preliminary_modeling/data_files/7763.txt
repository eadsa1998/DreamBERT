I went to a high school to give a talk. There were TV media there. I was on the gym floor sitting on a bench in the middle of the floor. The students were all on one side in the bleachers. They were very poorly behaved. I said something to the media person with a microphone. It was not until this time that I realized they were students. When I arrived at the school, the driveway and parking were very odd. It was as if I was driving down steps and then had to park on one side angled toward the direction I had come in. When I got ready to leave, I was told I had to leave in the direction I was headed when I came in. This was very awkward because of the direction of the parking I also did not know my way going that way. They told me to go the end, take a left, and then right. That I couldn't get lost. When I turned right, I was in something resembling a very narrow alley, one car width wide. I don't recall seeing building but there was a chain link fence and a lot of gates. Every few hundred feet I had to stop and open a gate. It also kept making turns. I was getting frustrated, upset, and angry. I left my car, threw some kind of very large square board to the side, and continued on foot. I came to a bunch of houses and was walking through their yards trying to figure out where the road to the highway was. I finally asked for directions at one house. A man and woman gave me directions but then she suggested that he take me back to my car and then lead me where I needed to go. He did. As we approached my car, he sympathized with me and told me they shouldn't have done that. He especially pointed out that the place I got out of my car was an especially hard place.
