I found myself attending college in Japan during the second World War. Actually it was Western Reserve University and the setting and surroundings were the same as they are in Cleveland today. My parents had informed me that at a certain hour and a certain day, the university was to be bombed by American planes. I was told to take all possible precautions and to leave the university at once secretly. Furthermore I was to tell a certain girl about this future bombing. I managed to find the girl and informed her and her parents of the air raid. Then eating in the cafeteria a fraternity brother of mine took the last bottle of milk from the counter. He would not share it with me so I vowed not to tell him of the forthcoming raid. In the cafeteria I saw another girl (whom I have just recently met) and I felt that I should warn her also. She put her tray down next to mine but then before I could say anything she had vanished.
