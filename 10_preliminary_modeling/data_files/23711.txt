I remember a man in my dream, we had been talking, discussing things (saw Slacker last night), like at a coffee house.  I remember thinking tax consultants contribute nothing to the economy.  This man made me very happy.  I think we were in love or attracted to each other.  I felt again an unmistakable feeling that I would be meeting someone and falling in love very soon.  Have felt this for about three weeks.
