You'll be sorry. I dreamed Grandma Meyer got spanked by a priest and everyone was against the priest. I was going with Al D. to his dept. to see his work. We saw a tiny boxcar on the rack. When the priest was spanking Grandmas, I threw a newspaper on the spot he was spanking her thru a window. A fellow was showing, pointing at a big pile of coal way out in the distance. He said, "See it?" I said, "Yes, I do." We were working in the shop running machines and the machines were fruit trees. I counted farmer's trees and he had 7 of them. I counted them again and six were fruit trees. Joe A. threw a pear to Kotnik and Kotnik moved my arm a little and missed it. We ran for it. I went to the left and he to the right and he found it. I walked up on the road and found a large marble. I threw it down below on the road. It bounded and Kotnik picked it up. I found another shooter. I saw a lot of trains going by a small country settlement of my boyhood days. They were excavating the settlement for new homes.
