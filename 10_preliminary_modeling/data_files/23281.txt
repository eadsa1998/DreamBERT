I wanted to limber up my arm and practice throwing for distance.  Two female friends went with me to a park to catch my throws, but we realized that we didn't have anything to throw.  We discussed what would work in lieu of a baseball or softball.  One of them suggested a grapefruit, and I said that it would be too soft and too large.  But it reminded me of how perfect lemons and limes had felt to me in the past for throwing, and I was willing to entertain the possibility of that.  In the end, though, I left the women in the park to go and get a couple of baseballs, either from my house or from a store.  It ended up being a wild goose chase; I had to take a bus, and then wasn't sure where to get off.  I was downtown, and it was pretty far between stops, so I would have to walk a lot if I got off at the wrong stop.  I was sweaty, and the bus was crowded; I felt uncomfortable for the people close to me.  There was a little girl standing next to me; she was friendly and talked to me a lot.  When I finally got off the bus, I had walked into something like a video arcade at the bus stop when I realized I hadn't paid my fare.  This was a Japanese-style system where you pay when you leave.  I rushed back and found the bus hadn't left yet.  When the last passenger had gotten off, I got on and dug a whole lot of change out of my pocket and started giving some of it to the bus driver.  I had the impression that the fare was 60 cents, but I couldn't distinguish one coin from another very well (even though it was American money), and I couldn't seem to keep up with the addition in my head.  As I gave it to him, the bus driver would tell me how much more I needed.  Finally, another bus driver dumped more change into my hand than I could hold; I couldn't figure out why.  I left the bus with a lot more change than I started with.
