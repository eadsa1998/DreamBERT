 I'm with my brother Wally in a van he is driving. There is a lot of snow on the ground. Some of the snow is too deep to drive through. We're in the house of an older lady, shoveling snow off the reddish, short fiber carpet, and then shoveling up the carpet itself. One of the shovels is blue metal, which is no good because it cracks and is bent. I grab an orange plastic shovel.
