I and a man dance a bunny hop kind of step through a long double line of people who are clapping their hands. On the way back, I sing a lasagna recipe in a blues style. Then I get to my kitchen and tell people not to mind the mess. I don't like to do dishes. They are piled high, everywhere. There are lots of strange-looking glasses, blue, pretty, odd-shaped, multi-colored. I then stand at one of three sinks and start washing dishes. The sink is long and narrow and it's hard to reach the dish drainer. Later, I move to the side and see that that's the original correct place to stand.
