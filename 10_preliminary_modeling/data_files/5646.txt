[1997-06-24] I was at my grandmother's house and I was feeling happy because I was in her kitchen. It was cold outside, the snow was falling. I guess I had gone outside just before I went into the kitchen because I remember the snowflakes kind of falling on my eyelashes and falling on my hair, my hair was wet. I went into her kitchen and she was baking my favorite kind of cookie which was chocolate chip and asking me if I wanted to help her bake cookies and I always enjoyed doing that because it meant that we would be sharing them with other people. So I was sitting there baking cookies with my grandma in her kitchen and just feeling really good about this until I awoke and realized that I had to get up and go back to work.
