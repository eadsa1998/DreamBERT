I was attending a wedding which was a bit odd and I had some sort of role like guest liaison. A guy who I had met a few days before hadn't turned up and I was worried because he has made suicidal comments. Mom and I decided to go check his house. We got there and the gate going to his backyard was open and she was looking back there and then we saw his body hanging from the back fence. It was covered a bit by clothes on the clothesline and bushes. I was upset that he had been there for probably 2 days and no one had noticed. He had left his back door open and he had a couple of cats. Their food bowls were empty but it looked like he had filled them up before he killed himself. The cats were friendly and that made me sadder. Later I had something to do with Big Brother. They got this digital 'milk' candle and were allowed to spend time outside with ex-housemates. Chanelle (BB8) was one of them and had like a best friend from the house that she hung out with. They had to go back when the candle melted, and they had to rush because they had forgotten. I was walking with some people, including Chanelle, and I said that I hated Big Brother letting in ex-housemates and said to Chanelle 'I don't mean I hate you, I just don't like them bringing in people who have gone. Once you're gone you're gone' and she agreed. Later I was somewhere inside and Steven (BBUK15) was there with this huge round ring on his left hand. Two girls were giggling over him and I was like ugh. Later I was with Technical College people watching some movie. The end was suddenly really gory and violent. I think someone got like squished and it showed all their guts and stuff on the floor. Juniper was there and looked disgusted and was like 'it's so gory' and some people agreed and I went it's not that bad and Mr Hoover like 'that's how you can tell if someone's a horror fan'.
