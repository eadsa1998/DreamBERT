This is the most bizarre dream I've had in a while. I dreamt that there like these friends that I had over at the house. There were like three or four of them. They were kind of okay at first, but then they kind of didn't want anything to do with me. And somehow I had the notion that we had a fire alarm system in the house, and that Dad and I were sitting out in the back yard reading or something and they were in the kitchen helping Mom bake a pie. And somehow they knew they knew that she was going to burn something in the oven and that it was going to go off, so they came out of the house and they got in back of the truck, in the bed of the truck, and I was like, "What are you guys doing in here?" And they were like, "I don't know; we don't want to tell you." And I kind of figured that it was probably going to go off so I climbed in the back with them, and there was just enough room for me to like lay down. And it was real greasy and kind of dirty back there. And Dad got in the cab of the truck and started it up and drove us away, and drove us around the block a few times. And then I dreamt that somebody was getting married and we had to go see them get married, and that they were going to like walk down the street any minute with their stuff. And one other thing -- I dreamt that I was looking through this book of biographies on techno singers, and I was looking for the girl who sings, "Come Into My Planet Soul." I can't sing at this hour of the morning! [laugh] And I couldn't find her, and then I think I woke up.
