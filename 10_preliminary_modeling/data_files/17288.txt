Dreamt of places to live.  Up on a little hill.  I got a room upstairs, in a very white building.  A building I'd only really gone into twice.  I was called down to the front office and was told I was 'expelled' because I hadn't attended the military training lecture.  I was shocked.  I had gone into the room but I wasn't aware we had to stay.  None of the other people there were paying attention.  I pleaded with the landlord.  We went up to my room, and I hadn't locked the door; my room was kind of trashed.  There was a hot tub next to it where some people were splashing around.  The landlord was appalled and kicked me out quickly. I saw the next girl that was coming to occupy the room.  Someone named Joni, I think.  The tenant list was going to be all girls from now on.  We left and started to explore a structure.  My boyfriend Jeremy and I started to climb into it.  Up, up up in a very narrow, dark little tube.  I don't know what we saw at the top, but we crawled back out the same way. It was too claustrophobic.
