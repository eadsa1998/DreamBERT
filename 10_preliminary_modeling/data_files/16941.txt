I'm listening to some music in my bedroom. Apparently in this dream I'm a teenager again. I have two brothers (who are black) who come into my room to borrow some of my CDs. I seem to be listening to R&amp;B and HipHop - all the stuff they want to borrow. I feel slightly pleased that they approve of my music collection. Later I'm invited to two parties - one by my friend Ron. It's not his party - but someone he knows - a girl I think. He is excited about a game we are going to play there. He has prepared props for it. It involves squeezing some small gauze sacks containing something I forget under a bar - like a squeegee - in a box, which creates an extended noise that Ron laughs about. The other party is Keith's - an old colleague from a past job.
