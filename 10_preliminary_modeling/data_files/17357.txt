I dreamt of an odd situation.  I don't know why, but all the cars were leaving.  The only four remaining were old red and blue cars.  I pulled into an area with a lot of people I knew.  They were waiting in lines and such, trying to figure out what was going on, trying to get their cars back, things like that.  Then, races of being pushed in some inner tube-like contraptions.  Then I was in a competition with a girl. I had to estimate how many stitches of a washcloth I could fit in my mouth.  My 'partner/pusher' had to count stitches on a washcloth.  It was close to a hundred per, and my guess had been 416.  I then had to try and fit that into my mouth.  I fit in 5.  After that the race started over.  I didn't run it this time, but a very young Candy, my old best friend in elementary school did.  They gave her a V-neck dress, blue, showing v for victory.  Her older brother was pushing her. They came in second, almost tied with a lady in a wheel chair.  Had to get ready for round two.
