I'm rehearsing a funny play or skit. Some security officers are in it with me. Some woman complains because I always seem to be in the security office and questions this. We obviously explain that we're working. We get a phone call from a girl "Tammy." She's threatening and playing games with us. We're a little caught in the game. She'll scream over the phone and be silent. We know she's playing a game but we have to go check it out anyway just in case. We sigh and feel frustrated.
