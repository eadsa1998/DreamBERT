I was in the living room of the house I lived in my junior year of college. There was a couch in there. I was sitting on the couch with a beautiful, naked, voluptuous woman. I was sucking.on one of her large breasts. I was fascinated by the fact that I could suck her entire breast into my mouth. I looked into a mirror on the wall as I did this, because I was so fascinated. Then I leaned over and began performing oral sex on her. Just then, there was a knock at the door. I ran up to get it. I opened the door and there were three or four of my friends, none of whom know each other. There was an acquaintance of mine from middle school. He had brought a friend I had never seen before. There was an acquaintance of mine from high school. Finally, there was this beautiful girl I am friends with from my language class. They came into the other family room. The naked woman was no longer present. They started raging and partying in the house. They started shakig up soda cans and spraying them all over the room. They sprayed in Mohawk-shaped sprinkler patterns. I asked them not to, but they kept doing it. My friend from high school told me to try it; I said "No!" Then he proceeded to spray a can over my head so that I was covered in soda. The entire room was covered in soda. I became angry and overwhelmed. I assigned each of them a part of the room to clean. At that time, my middle school acquaintance went upstairs to my bedroom with the girl from my class. I went into the kitchen to get sponges and cleaning supplies. I wet a bunch of paper towels. The girl from my language class came in. She said, "You can't make them clean." I asked, "Why not?" She told me, "You can't have guests over and have them clean. When I have guests over, I clean everything myself, so you should too." I agreed, but was mad. I asked her how she could hook up with my friend. I told her, "You've had a boyfriend for three years and if you're going to cheat on him, it had to be with me."
