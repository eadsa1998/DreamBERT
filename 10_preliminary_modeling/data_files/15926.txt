We were in a classroom and Ms Nowak was teaching, but most of the class was different. Our assignment was to write stories based on these vague one-sentence plot lines. The first one was something like 'your best friend wakes you up as a baby at 5am' and she said she always imagined waking up in Africa. I asked if 'best friend' could be yourself or anything since I didn't have a best friend or any close friends and she said I could. I decided to write it from the point of view of the Star Child from 2001: A Space Odyssey where his best friend is the Earth and he's waking up to watch over it. Ms Nowak said there were 39 answers to all the questions and I was like 'what there can't possibly only be 39 different stories' and I was pretty sure no-one would've done mine.
