I gave G. a pocket book containing several hundred dollars, and sent him out to secure a passage for Europe. He soon came back, giving me the balance of my money and my ticket, a very small one, enclosed in an envelope marked, reasonable enough, "First Class, $80." He also gave me a folder containing information regarding the line and its ships. These had odd short names of a Slavic form; I think one was "Apski." Suddenly I remembered I was married and must not leave my wife. I regretted my purchase and asking G. whether I could hope to sell my ticket to a scalper, I woke.
