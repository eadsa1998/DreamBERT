["Dora misses me and I miss her."] I am visiting my parents in M City. I am sitting in a black leather recliner chair watching TV. I am feeling very tired and sleepy. I'd been there for a day already. Dora comes in. I am very happy to see her. She says I've really missed you. I say me too. Dora suggests we spend a day together. I agree. I suggest Thursday. That means I would leave the next day Wednesday, for home (MM City) and have time to rest up before Thursday. I ask Dora if she lives in A City now. She says yes. Great, I say. She shows me photos and I have trouble guessing which one is Alan. Two or three look like him. She agrees that this one cousin named Frank looks a lot like him. Dora misses Willie very much. That's part of what we will talk about. She feels sad and needs a friend to talk with. I look forward to our meeting. I've missed her a lot. I am glad we are getting together.
