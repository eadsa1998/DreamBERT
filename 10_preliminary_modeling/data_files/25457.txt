 I'm in a church, where there is a huge granite structure, cut and polished. It is a fountain. There is some confusion about whether it should be inverted/reversed or not. It is a depression now. There is a bathroom there, and in the ceiling of the bathroom is a small hole about six inches in diameter. I climb into the hole feet first: I am upside down. People lift me up. I try to climb in again, and as I am lifted I spin like I am on a spit. One of my arms is outstretched and my hand is planted. One of my legs is flexed and my toes pointed, touching the other wall. I spin around very fast several times and fall to the ground. I hurt my right hip. People call for help. A police officer gets there. I am okay when he arrives. <br/
