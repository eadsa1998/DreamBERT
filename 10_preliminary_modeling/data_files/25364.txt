 I'm riding a bike that's kind of small for me. I leave my house and bike down 2nd Street towards Jefferson School. My mom is yelling instructions or reminders to me as I go. I don't want to leave outright, but I ride slow and listen to her. I think she goes to the corner of 2nd and Home Avenue to call out final instructions. I want to raise the seat of the bike up so I can fully extend my legs when I pedal. I have to stop and adjust the seat several times. I ride into the Partridge's yard on the corner of 2nd and Old Avenue. I ride around the outside of their house, and am going to ride down the hill in front of their house and onto the street. I go past a window. The Partridge family sees me. I think they might throw something out the window at me. When I get to the front of the house I dodge the shrubs. There is a wire fence, and I stop. There are random pieces of wood that the kids have used to play. I pick up the bike and walk over the wood and step over the fence to get out of the yard.
