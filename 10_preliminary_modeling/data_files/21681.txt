We lived in a schoolhouse. It was a big brick building. There was a playground in the front of it. I said, "Look, now we live in the schoolhouse and the playground is right in front of it. We don't seem to get away from the kids." We were working at White's and there was not much work. The men were just loafing, putting in their time. I looked at one of my friend's eye and he had a brass chip floating in it. I said, "Let me take it out," and he said, "The nurse does a good job of it. I'm going into the dispensary." Someone was selling sewing machines. They had a price on them and if cash was paid within 30 days, a $25 deduction was given from the $125. I argued that the machine was a $100 item; why try to fool the people?
