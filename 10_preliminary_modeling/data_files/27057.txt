There were two girls and myself sitting around a table in H-- Hall. We were watching a fellow and girl come down the steps. Each of us knew the fellow and one by one we told each other of our experiences with him. Each story was similar to the other. There was a fourth vacant chair and we expected the girl he was with to fill it.
