At the start of the dream I found myself in a large room filled with water. The water level reached to my hips. Suddenly I found myself wearing a pair of rubber hip boots and was overjoyed at the protection they offered. Other than the hip boots however, I was completely naked. I frantically tried to force open a door leading to another room and finally succeeded. The next room was also filled with water, but there were many hats floating on the surface. I then noticed hundreds of brown overcoats hanging on the walls above the level of the water. I wanted to get a dry one to put on, but every coat I came to was soaking wet. The same was true of every hat. After trying all the hats and coats and finding them all wet, I started to cry and that was as much of the dream as I remembered.
