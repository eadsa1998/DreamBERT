I dreamed that I was to sing on the stage in front of a large audience. But when I got in front of the audience I couldn't think of a song to sing. My mother was out front and was very disturbed. I left the stage and went backstage where I found a doll. I then thought of a song to sing, the old song "You Great Big Beautiful Doll." I then ran round looking for an appropriate costume. I dressed up as a little girl with a huge ribbon in my hair. I then took the doll and got on the stage and sang the song with ease.
