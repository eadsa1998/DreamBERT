I was on the computer on a game, except I was playing it out live, and it showed red and green dots. It was in this street, except it was in abandoned village. I jumped across a building. I was on top of the building and bad guys were gathering around on the ground. I was shooting at them. Others came and we finished them off. This gate was open and we left and were trying to find some information. Elijah found this room with "our homework" in it. This teacher person came. Then we were in a carpark and we had to put things on our heads so we didn't get wet, then it was raining. Ezra was there. A car of someone who was bad came. I can't read the rest of my notes.
