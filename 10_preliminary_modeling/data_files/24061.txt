I'm in a strange house. It's a mix of the upstairs of my old house on one street and the distinct living room and kitchen of my old house on another street. I walk downstairs into the living room and the kitchen table is in the living room for some strange reason. There are candles lit on the table and a big Ominoos book. I begin reading the book and soon realize that it's full of curses and black magic. This isn't fantasy, it's present day and I know this book is dangerous, but I keep going. Inside there are instructions and ingredients I've never heard of. As I read it, in my mind a voice from the book or somewhere chants it with me. Then I stop reading, but the voice continues. It surrounds me and penetrates my head and I wake up.
