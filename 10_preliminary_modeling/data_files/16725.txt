I'm outside, and there's this animal that I think to be a fox. Then I see a little dog that had been beaten up. It looked like a black lab. Then the fox took me by surprise and threw the nearly dead dog on top of me, as if he was taking us both for dead. We were both on the ground. I thought by that by that time the dog was undoubtedly dead, but found that he was still breathing and making noise. I was furious at the fox for doing this to the poor dog. There was a car trying to get through, and I carefully moved the dog to the side of the road. I really didn't think the dog would make it, and I was almost hoping for someone to put him out of his misery but I really wanted to protect the dog and was hoping that he just might be ok. I picked up the fox, who gave a good fight and had claws, but I had to get him away from the dog so he didn't hurt him any more. Then I attempted to throw the fox as far as possible. In the dream, I assumed the fox to be ok anyway, and if I threw him over a fence, he might be hurt just enough so that he didn't go after the dog anymore. Anyway, the fox didn't go as far as I expected when I threw it, and I woke up immediately after throwing the fox.
