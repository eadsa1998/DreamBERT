I'm going down a walkway between little, close-set houses looking for something and pretending I'm in a detective story, sneaking around and prepared for anything - I jump at a sound and dive into a convenient garage, flipping over and springing into position behind something for cover. Ironically, the door starts to close - slides sideways. The person doing it peeks in for a second. I recognize him (somebody from TV). I jump up to let him know I'm there and make excuse that I just stepped in to wipe dust off me or something. He lets me out and I sheepishly go on. At the end of the street there's sort of a shopping center with a Sanger's and I remember the bra sale. I run into Bill Wilding, who's waiting for me and asks me to take something with me to hand over to somebody I'm going to see. It's a bunch of what looks like hairpins, only not black. We drop some when he's handing them to me and I stoop to help pick them up. I'm a bit annoyed that he expects me to do this. We are next to another person but I don't know who. I continue to a house or apartment where there are some people waiting for me, we're preparing for something and there's a task to be performed right now. My mother is there, I think, or somebody I feel that way about - maybe 3 couples and an extra man, who's friendly and pats me on the butt, which I hate and almost yell at him but not quite and I say to myself next time I will. I think the others know and they think he's a creep too. When I realize what we've got to do I'm very disappointed because I was expecting to get dinner - I haven't had much to eat all day - my mind flashes back to one of my male cousins skimpy breakfasts*, and I haven't had anything to speak of since. I am really let down and whiny. [Dream ends there, I think - but I also think it didn't begin there, there was more before.]
