He brings two pieces of wrapping paper for my small boxes and suggests ones for this box but I show him it is the larger box. Trim one piece of paper and start to wrap my round inlay box. I say its contents will have to be rearranged. Then it is full of small stones and bits of lava. Couldn't the stones by thrown away? I don't want that box wrapped now. It has my keys in it and I don't want to move the keys lest I forget where they are.
