I must have gone back three or four years, for my surroundings seemed to be those of the old building, and I was up in the choir. The other singers were strangers to me, excepting that F. Williams was among them. We sang Adeste Fideles and a hymn set to the tune of "Aletta," as I recall the melody, but "Hortonissimus" in the book. Before I woke up, I had settled it that the superlative form meant "most cultivated"--Lat. Hortus.
