There seems to be some overlap in characters from the previous dream, but the theme is completely different.  I was in a pick-up baseball game with some other guys -- acquaintances, I think, possibly including Gaylen Tuttleson, Darrell Evans, and Bobby Dilson -- in a big hangar or garage-type building where they worked.  After the first half inning, some of them had to go back and do some work (they had been on their lunch break), and the game was temporarily halted.  I was very anxious for the game to resume, since I was the first batter in our half of the inning, and I was eagerly swinging a bat to loosen up.  The game never resumed, though, and I was very disappointed.
