In the parlor, trying to read a very thick boob by 5 Chicago professors. I notice Hornell Hart's name and try to see where he is now. Difficulty in finding title page and in reading name. My eyes are very heavy and keep closing. Open only with effort to read. Mr. How. Is trying to set up card table in rain. Debate whether to ask for game but decide he wants to play solitaire. Notice one bow of my glasses is almost broken. It is spinning out on gold threads. Trying to mend it as I don't wish to go down town for a few days. A. is trying to help me.
