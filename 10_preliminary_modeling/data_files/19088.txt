This dream was a movie that I had appeared in, that is, I felt in the dream that what was happening was from a movie I made in the past. I was interrupted in it though fairly early. I didn't even have time to appear, in fact. There were 2 men, police officers, by their patrol car. They were holding someone. A third man was there who was accusing the man they were holding or something, and a 4th man, a bystander. They were kind of beating at the kidneys of the person they were holding. Also there was a still shot of this particular composition with my girlfriend like in front of it. She had a role to play in the movie too later on. So this was perhaps like a book I was reading with a movie in it. There was one still shot of this particular man, the 3 men by the car, and my girlfriend standing out in front, her face outlined and that was a still shot. I think I was going to be in the movie later on. I was interrupted though.
