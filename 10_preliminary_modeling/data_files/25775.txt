 I am having a contest with Tom Gugliotta. I recognize him but he has a different name. Before we begin, one of the female teachers I have had in the past indicates to Tom that she thinks I can rebound better than he can. We keep track of points and rebounds. We use a beach ball-like ball. We're in a tiny room. Before we start I tell Tom that it's not how high you jump that makes you a good rebounder. I say I'm a good rebounder because I know how to use my body in rebounding. I block some of his shots. I'm playing better than he is, and I outrebound him. There is a marathon going on in a cafeteria-like area that seems to be at Brimson College. There are many senior students there, who are tan and stylish, just sitting around. I run in this race. People look at me, and I look at them. One woman thinks I'm looking at her because I'm attracted to her. While she isn't unattractive, I'm looking at her because she is a senior. The marathon is run clockwise around this place. A man who worked in Mason Cafeteria as a cook is yelling out to students that are in back of the line, asking them if they want some food item, which may be turkey. They have hot turkey, which looks appetizing.
