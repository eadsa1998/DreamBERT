I looked into the clothes closet and I had water pipes and valves there. The water was leaking quite a bit from one of the valves. I pushed a plunger down into the socket and it stopped quite a bit. I looked into one of the electric sockets and there was a phosphorus light or like a burning electric on some parts of it, so I turned off the switch. There seemed to be a short circuit. Ann and I were stepping across large rocks and it was on the edges of them. I looked down on the rocks and told Ann to watch her step.
