I dreamed that I went to a party at Tim's house; however, none of my friends were there. So then I went to Drivers Ed and they were all there. We had to play all these games to help us learn how to drive. Hugh was there and he kept poking me and then saying, "You can never be my girlfriend because you can't drive yet." Weird. So then I dreamed that it was spring carnival again and we were all Jello-wrestling. I wanted to do my laundry so I wouldn't be wearing my sticky clothes. But apparently the laundry service put your dirty clothes in bags and never washed them. Then I woke up.
