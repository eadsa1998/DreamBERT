I am sort of Yul Brynner in a swimming pool. I am also a woman who talks to Jack Benny. Then I (the woman) says or does something that touches Yul Brynner deeply. He tries to describe this insightful moment to Jack Benny. He reaches over to a lamp, which is in the swimming pool, and unplugs it (or plugs it in, I don't remember which way it goes) and then carries the lamp and begins to follow me (the woman) as I get out of the pool. He stands directly behind me, wanting contact. I become aware of him.
