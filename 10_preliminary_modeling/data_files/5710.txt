[1997-05-19] I was doing the dinner dishes, my daughter and her boyfriend called to say that they had left a pitcher of milk on the drainer and for me to put it away. Then there was breakfast that I was cleaning up after and my wife had made me 2 cups of tea and I had just, I remember taking the teabags out of both cups and dumping them in the sink and then putting sugar in the tea from the sugarbowl and the spoon I was using was bent so that the spoon part was bent downward and I had to tilt the spoon way back to keep the sugar from running out.
