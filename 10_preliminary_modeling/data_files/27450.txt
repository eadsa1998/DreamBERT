I dreamed about my younger sister, aged 16, who died last June. I cannot remember many details except that she appeared just as she was before her death--pathetically emaciated. My mother and I also were in the dream, but I do not remember what we did; also a few other members of the family seem to have been vaguely present. The dream took place in our home and I have the impression we were carrying on family life as usual.
