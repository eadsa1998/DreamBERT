I open the front door and there is Arvonne, drunk, saying goodnight to some guy. I am surprised because she doesn't live here anymore and she's forgotten that. She goes into the bathroom and washes her face and then goes and falls into her old room, in bed with Charla. I go peek in and see Charla's still asleep, I'm worried Arvonne will be upset at the mess in Charla's room and then worried Arvonne will be angry if Charla wakes up and is noisy. Then I'm worried Ellie will be angry when she hears Arvonne is here and I don't want her here, but feel timid about doing anything. I tell Ellie and she's pissed. I try to smooth it all out.
