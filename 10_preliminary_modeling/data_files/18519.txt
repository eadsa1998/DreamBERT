I was going to the hotel swimming pool with 2 strangers; a man and a woman and they each had backpacks and provisions. Army backpacks. The girl had to practice singing and she could not sing so good, so she needed to be by herself. I thought the pool should be able to fit 3 people easy but they wanted to know. Rudy was very little. He was learning to walk and my father had chosen a spot I didn't think was too good for such a little kid to learn to walk. It was down endless counts of stairs, from the top of the mountain to the valley. But my father was exuberant over climbing down the mountain. When we got there it was time to take the elevator back up to the roof where to pool was. I had a pair of goggles with alternation blinking lights. I'd put my contacts in but one eye hurt, and I realized I had not peeled (off) the foil and plastic cover. I peeled the plastic off and threw it down on the ground so that Dora would not put the plastic in her eye, even though my contact lens prescription was twice as bad as hers. Not being able to see made me calm. Rudy had to sit on the top floor with my mother; I was throwing the goggles up several stories. I had been playing on my guitar. Then I left. I was running down the subway stairs. I had forgotten to get a token. The train was pulling out and I didn't think I'd make it in time. A guy was shaking his raised fist at the train for not stopping. I had been weaving. We packed on to a WWII train, elbow to elbow, with people close together. It was very crowded. There was a sign for 1st, 2nd, 3rd class. People were rushing and shoving, being hateful.
