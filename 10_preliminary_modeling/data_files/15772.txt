I was somewhere with a bunch of people, including some people from Big Brother. Steven was talking about something to the others and I said 'feck off, shut up' and it went silent and he was like 'no swearing kiddies. Awkward'. I walked off, trying not to laugh and stood next to a wall. Ashleigh came and stood by me and was talking to me. Kim was behind me and it was early on in the series when they were still friends. We were joking about 'stroking peanut butter' and laughing and then Chris came up and I said 'we're just talking about stroking peanut butter' and he was like 'ok' and we all started laughing. There was another 'eviction' coming up and we had to decide whether Winston stayed evicted or another person and I was really annoyed. They also showed some clips from the past including this task, which I had liked, which involved a huge tree and Pauline dressed as some kind of green witch fairy thing. She had two rings on one hand, on the middle and ring finger which had a square emerald type of thing in them. At some point I thought I was dreaming and was making people appear. I started saying it out loud when I saw Stephen Merchant, in a suit and with shorter hair, walk around the corner, look at me and then go into a toilet cubicle. I walked over and deliberated about going in, but peeked into the cubicle and saw him standing there and went in. He locked the door and immediately started kissing me. That progressed to us having sex, with me up against the wall and my legs around him. It was really intense and I could feel it all. At one point someone looked over the cubicle and was trying to put post-it notes around and I told them to get lost. I woke up during the 'end' of it.
