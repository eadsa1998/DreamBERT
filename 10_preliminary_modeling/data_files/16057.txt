I was at Jungle Park and that Mom was going to have her art show there, and we were walking through some thick foliage and looking at different animals and looking at different people's displays and we decided to go back to the band show and see if they had their sound board set up yet. So we got back there and there was a rope fence partitioning off this spot of ground where they were going to put the equipment. And there were a whole bunch of chairs set up, but there was no band and no sound tech, so we kept walking around for a while. And then we got back, we decided to go back and see if they were set up, and I saw this guy sitting in the spot where the board was supposed to be with the radio, and he said, "They're not going to have a band today. They're not going to need me today." And then I woke up.
