I was sorting and packing boxes and trunks and hunting for certain articles in an attic full of boxes and trunks. Mother told me clothes for the oldest should be in the oldest trunk, those for the next oldest in the middle and those for the youngest in the newest. I asked, "which is it, the tan or the brown?" I knew the blue gray was the oldest. I kept on looking for the lost articles and then learned mother had placed them on top of a box. "Why didn't you tell me you'd found them?" I demanded angrily and R. chimed in, "she (that is I) ought to be whipped repeatedly."
