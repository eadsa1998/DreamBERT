I was typing in my password for something. Ezra was in my room. It showed and it said 'dmit' (the password was 'dmitrikohler'). I was like "What the hell? Oh! It showed the middle of the password!" to try and make it seem like it was another word. I was going through my dreams and there was one with Eugene.
