My sister, who is 19 years old, was complaining about the humidity. She and my brother, who is 20 years old, now appear in a room with which I am not familiar. I bring a stuffed bag into the room. They start to pull out of the bag a series of cards which look like invitations and which are wet and have stuck to each other because of the water. They do this on top of a desk. I see that all the cards have a little sign with my sister's name on them, and that in many of the cards the little sign is slipping because of the water.
