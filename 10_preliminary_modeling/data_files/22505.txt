I dreamt I was in the practice lab at the university and Joe came to pick me up because he had a journalism session in the main hall. We went in his car and arrived too early, and in the car Joe started to hint around the fact that he wanted me to go steady with him. I hesitated, but did accept him, and I answered him "Ari" (yes in quechua), OUI (yes in French), Yes (in English), and Si (Yes in Spanish), but after so much happiness, he got angry because he is jealous. When I got out of the car because Freddie was coming (President of the Journalism Students). He came over and I left and he stayed there, angry. There it ended.
