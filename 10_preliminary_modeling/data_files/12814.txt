Ezra and I were wagging. Nicolas was hanging around. We had to run past Mr Norris etc. The next day, Dad found out we were wagging. Mom had been picking us up. The next day we went to this oval place which had a tennis court. Eugene came. He saw me and then left. We all had to run through these 'accordion' doors. There were these elevator things and moving blocks which we had to jump over. It was a big Phys Ed obstacle course. I ended up in this dark room which was mainly a big hole, but had platforms with beds on them. Mr Quinlan was watching over. Eugene fell down and Darius was trying to help him. I was reading his stuff and looking at baby pictures (though it was actually all about Rafe Spall) and it had his mothers name and stuff. Calvin text me to see if I was coming to school tomorrow.
