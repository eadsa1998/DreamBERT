Ted Bundy and I were hanging out. He had done something bad and we were running from the police. He had 'powers' and could stop time and rewind it, among other things. We were driving fast in this car and it went airborne over this gap and landed on this mountain sort of thing, with a road on it. There was a goat in the car. He drove on this wobbly road really fast and I was worried we would go over the edge. We ended up in Washington DC. The house thing was near a fair and a restaurant. This lady and her kids were at the fair and I said something to the kid and the mother chucked a spaz. Ted paused or did something weird to the time and I bashed her. She said that I'd said "Sod off". He rewound time and we left. Johnny Depp was in the restaurant and Ted said "Now he's eating" and then Johnny looked at us for a second and then left. I was sitting at a table and some girl asked if I wanted to go to some back room. I said no, but Ted went. I left the table and saw Johnny Knoxville coming out of a cinema. I asked him for a photo and he said "It's not important" and went to rest somewhere. He was going to the back room, so I went in there first. It was all seats, like a cinema. It was dark and I was trying to find Ted. Then all these people started to pretend that they were who I was looking for. Ted made them turn the lights back on and I found him and we left. As we were walking out through some door, I had my arm around him and I realized and quickly took it back.
