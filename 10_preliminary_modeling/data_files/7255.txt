The bus had stalled and I asked a woman if they were going to send a taxi for us. She said no. I hadn't far to go but I couldn't remember at which part of the beach I was to meet Cara Y. I started off and saw the boy (her son?). We went on together. He told me about the funny plates his mother was bringing. We met her and went to a bathhouse and on the wooden table set out our picnic. She passed out large yellow vinyl plates, dishing out something on each. I thought my portion too small and she gave me more. I arranged loose leaves, pages 7, 9, 11 and 13 in my library book and asked her when she was leaving for Japan. "In February," and she talked of her teaching here. Then we began to pack up to go home.
