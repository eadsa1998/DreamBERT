I'm at a house that looks familiar to the one I used to live in on by the beach, but it's not the same. I'm sitting on a couch in the living room and I'm surrounded by people and we're all watching TV. The couch I'm sitting on is really crowded and I'm pressed up against this attractive girl, but when I look over at her again, she's gone and my friend Kiel is there. And he pretends like he's going to make out with me, and I'm pretending to and it's a big joke and everyone laughs. But then he really does start to make out with me and I'm trying to push him away, but he grabs the crotch of my pants and I push him off, but I look on the ground and I've cum all over the ground. And I'm totally embarrassed, but no one has seemed to notice yet. Kiel whispers to me, "Dude, I'll just tell people that you spilled water, oh, and pull your pants up." And now my pants and boxers are around my ankles and my penis is hanging out, but no one notices. They're too busy watching TV. I put my clothes on and take a deep breath. I think, "Whew, no one found out." Then I wake up.
