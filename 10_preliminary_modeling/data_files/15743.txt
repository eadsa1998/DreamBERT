I had been out and came home at night. I pulled up in driveway in Mom's usual spot and then apparently fell asleep. I woke up some time later to Mom checking on me. I got out and was saying that it was pretty dangerous and stupid of me to fall asleep in my unlocked car, but then my bed was outside, next to the steps and this was normal. I got into bed and Mom was talking to me still. I briefly thought it was strange that I had my bed outside, but didn't think more of it. Ezra was there too. Three Hispanic looking guys walked past the house and up the driveway to the house behind us, looking at us through the side. We thought it was weird, so went inside. I was walking down the hall and then saw them running through the gate as Mom slammed the wood door shut. She said "oh my god, one of them has a knife!" They were banging and trying to get in. I went into my room and called the cops. I was speaking really calmly and I was worried they'd think I was lying.
