Somehow, I got a hold of Eugene's calculator or iPod, it kept changing. I took his valence table because it was better. His music was stuff I'd never heard of and I was thinking that I loved him even more. I told Jeremiah about the valence table, and then he wanted it. He was in a basketball club which changed to a soccer club called Sleepwalkers. Calvin was there. Some people did this dance thing. Gregg and someone married. Classmate-M-28 had his arm around Mackenzie. I was thinking 'ew' but that I wouldn't mind if it was Eugene and I. Calvin went in front of this camera filming the match. He asked Eugene why his shirts were green. He said that green was a good colour. Alejandro said "they're not full of colour, but they have lots of character", but colour and character were supposed to be the other way around. Evelyn wanted to do a quiz thing I'd gotten. I was saying it was random. This bus drove into a book shop and I saw Goosebumps books and got excited. There was a big house and I was flying around and I fell. At some point, Ms Solomon gave me work back and I got a level 3.
