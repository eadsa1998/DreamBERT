I am teaching an assertiveness class. The students are all spread out too far and then there's a glass partition between them and me. I knock on the glass and comment I don't like it being in the way. It makes it hard to teach. I then sigh and tell the students that I don't like assertiveness because I have to work harder, being assertive, and then hasten to add that, of course, it's best to be assertive and it's worth the extra energy. But I feel tired. I start teaching the nine-part statement. Then I'm in my bedroom. I see a photo of them side by side of twin beds. I'm seated on the end of the left bed with several children. Dovre is laying in the other bed with several kids. Then that goes and I am getting into the bed and Tom comes in (of dream group) and I'm naked and fat and grope for covers to cover me up. Tom sees me and is blushing bright red in embarrassment.
