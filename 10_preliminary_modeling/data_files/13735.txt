I can't remember what happened at the beginning, but I went to Northtown High School (which was different) looking for something. There were lots of black people and they weren't letting us through. Later, I was leaving and going down some steps and these girls were getting in the way and yelling things at me. I pushed past them. My car had a hole around the area that the registration sticker thing was. Every car had it, but my sticker was a little bit above it, so you could put your hand through the hole. Poppa put his hand through to grab something and I asked if we could cover it.
