I was with my mother in a cavern. It had been flooded by an underground stream. There was a plant about 10 feet long across some water, but I was afraid to cross it. There was a light, but I could not see a source. Later, I was walking through a muddy passage with a patient named Fugal. He found some fruit in the mud. I suggested that he wash it so he could eat it.
