I was in a customs office with my brother and a man dressed as a custom's agent of about 40 years, white, with an oval face and glasses, who was sitting at his desk. Suddenly a messenger came in with a package for the man to inspect. He looked at it and without touching it, he said that it could pass (it was a package wrapped in a large calendar). My brother said that this seemed strange and he stuck his hand inside the calendar and took out three jars about 4 inches tall which had a green label from which I could clearly read the name (but I don't remember it). Inside there were tablets which looked like lentils, including in size and color. My brother opened the jar and examined the tablets and he told me that they were for sneezing, and I took one and my brother took another one (I thought it was illogical to make tablets for sneezing). Suddenly we were not with the man at customs, but in my room, in which I saw everything as it is. My brother dropped a box of chess pieces and they broke and spread throughout the room. My brother and I started to pick up the pieces and we were kneeling in front of the closet door (which was open) and a slow but strong tremor started; that is, the whole house shook from one side to another and the drawer (the fourth drawer of the closet) slipped through the grooves at the same time the house shook and the drawer came in and out. My brother ran out, looking for my nephew (10 months old). I searched, rather looked, all over the room for something to take out and my poncho was on top of my dresser. And I pulled and a camera which was on top of it fell. Before leaving my room, I looked out the window and my mother was throwing out a blanket. Across the street the lady who lives there was on the street looking at my mother. Then I left and got to the street and my whole family was there.
