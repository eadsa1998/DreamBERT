I dreamed that I was helping my wife clean house, which incidentally I did do the day of the dream. She was working in the kitchen and I was putting up venetian blinds in the living room and dining room. As soon as I would complete putting the blinds up in the living room they would fall and I would become disgusted and attempt to erect the dining room blinds which would fall immediately after I put them up. This occurred many times until in anger and in haste I nailed the blinds to the molding. The funny part is that I had driven the nails in backwards but yet they seemed to serve the same purpose.
