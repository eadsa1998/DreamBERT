 I'm in hotel/casino. It doesn't seem to be that big, but I'm disoriented. I sit in a spa that is only lukewarm. Many people arrive and I leave shortly thereafter because I don't want to be around them. I wander through rooms. There is a big bathroom, a shower area; maybe several bathrooms. I try to find my way out or in. I'm in the casino portion when I notice my old classmate Bud Slick standing next to me. I say, "Hi Bud." Then I notice all the Slicks are there: the whole family puts on disguises like moustaches and clothing. All the members of their family are professional gamblers. I begin to walk away, carrying a pool cue. A man that works at the casino runs after me yelling, "Settler". I stop and turn around. He tells me I'm going to have to leave the casino. He is kicking me out because I'm wearing sandals with no socks on my feet. I try to reason with him, pleading for him to give me a break. He is shorter and larger than I: about 5'8", 230 pounds. He has a light brown/reddish goatee that is tied or bound together right beneath his chin, but which flares out below the binder. The goatee is fuzzy/furry. He notices my goatee, which I may have in a rubber band at the time. This is our common bond. This bond, along with my pleading causes him to say that I can stay in the casino. I walk to a different part of the building. I go up stairs. A woman is there. I'm outside the casino. It's raining. I'm wearing white socks with no sandals. I run in the rain, trying to avoid puddles that would get my socks unnecessarily dirty. I run up to the main entrance of the casino, thinking I'll be able to find the way to where I want to go from there. I'm lost. Cars pull up to the valet.
