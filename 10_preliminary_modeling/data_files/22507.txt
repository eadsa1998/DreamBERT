The phone was ringing with impatience. My mother picked it up and the call was for me. I was sleeping and they woke me up. I picked up the phone and it was Freddie, who was calling me desperately because his mother was very sick. She was dying, her pressure had gone up and he wanted me to go to his home. I told him I would go and hung up. I called my father to ask his permission to go, but he didn't want me to. He didn't understand my position and said that he didn't have to call on me and left me speaking. I asked my mother to convince him, and cried inconsolably and saw Freddie's desperation. I saw a dark room where everything was sadness, but I didn't help him.
