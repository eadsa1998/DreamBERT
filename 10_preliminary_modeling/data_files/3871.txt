["Sheep's Feet: Eaten Alive."] I am watching as two large dogs are gnawing on a live sheep's feet. I am horrified and scream at them to stop. I try to rush at them or distract them. Nothing works. Someone else is resigned to the inevitability of this but I am sick with disgust and sympathy. I empathetically feel their pain. I see the feet are gone and the leg muscles up to the mid-calf are down to bare bone. The dogs never let up.
