I had, actually Mom and I were going to go somewhere. I don't remember where or what we were doing. But, you know how before I get in the car sometimes when I'm going with Mom, I'll raise the antenna a little bit? Well, the car in this dream was like a baby toy. It was like one of those things that kids sit in and push through the floor with their feet, plastic things that roll along the sidewalk, except it looked red and white like the color design of our car and it didn't have a top, just like a kiddy car. And it had an antenna on it, but it was like a white wire like house receivers have, and it was sort of dragging along the floor as I pushed this along on the living room floor. And I don't remember if it had anything in it or not, but I don't think so. And it was the weirdest thing, and I was like pushing it out the front door and bumping it down the steps and everything. And then that was all I could remember of that little scene.
