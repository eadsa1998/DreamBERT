A group of vampire type people had taken over one of the carriages and blocked out the sun and just kept to themselves (there were quite a few of them in there and I think they'd either eaten or gotten rid of the people in the other carriages). They could go in the sun but would feel sick and blinded and would eventually just like throw up and die. They would get out of the train at night, usually at public toilets to find people to eat (lots of toilet stops presumably because there were no toilets on the train). Two guy friends were at this toilet when the train stopped there. It was hinted at that one of the vampires had died and they needed a replacement. They weren't really bad guys, but they did need to consume blood regularly. One of the vampire guys got off and 'infected' one of the guys (can't remember how it was passed). The guy ran off with his friend though. Whilst the vampire was looking for him, the guy accidentally infected his friend (they didn't know at that point though). The sun came up and the guy was outside but for him it looked like a desert and the sun was bright and hot and he was feeling sick. The train was nearby and the vampire guy told him to get in or he'd die and he went with him and got on the train. When he felt better he refused to go anywhere else without his friend. He found him eventually and realised he was infected and dying. He told him to get on but his friend refused, so he grabbed him and took him on to the train. It screeched to a halt and a warning saying the passenger limit was overloaded started going off (which would call in authorities if left too long) and the friend jumped back off and said 'it's too dangerous, just leave me' and the train started up and he tearfully watched his friend as it moved on.
