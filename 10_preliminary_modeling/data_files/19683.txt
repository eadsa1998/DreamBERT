I meet Uncle Elmo and Gertie B on a street in Big City in my home state. We walk along together. Elmo asks Gertie who came to town with her last night at midnight. She said a man named "Eutaw" (or similar sounding name). Presently we are walking along a path which borders a slough. There are tufts of swamp grass on each side of path, and the path itself is partially overgrown and sloppy. Elmo and Gertie turn off to the left of a fence but I feel confident of getting through along the path, which I follow. Very soon I come to a place where the path is submerged by an arm of the slough, and as the water is icy cold, and the arm is wide enough to be difficult or impossible for me to jump I am stopped.
