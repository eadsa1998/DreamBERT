I'm on a train or bus. A man gets on. He's a soldier and he grabs a boy and yanks him into the bathroom and rapes him. The boy screams and cries. Then the soldier comes out and says, "Now I want a woman." He grabs me and takes me in there. I do not cry out or fight. When he's done he chains me to another "brave one," a man. Each of our arms are chained to a carton of 18 eggs.
