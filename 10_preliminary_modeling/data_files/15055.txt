I went on MAIS. Ms Burton said that there was an 'expulsion' of results and that some results had been lost and those people would have to do extra credit. It also said that a red car had been affected. I was now at home and I went to my car. It was in an underground car park. The car was facing the wall and it was next to this tiny blue 'cab' part of a Ute. There was another car parked nearby and it had heaps of oil under it and around it, almost flooding it. People were sweeping water. I was then in a library and Natalie Warbuton was there and she grabbed a pile of my dreams, thinking they were for her to read out and I said 'they're mine, they're not relevant' etc. She couldn't read them anyway. Dad text me saying that he and a friend wanted me to help them with some chemistry stuff. Ezra got a job at a shop, sweeping. We turned the music up in the shop, because the shop next door's music was louder. This guy said Ezra could get Poppa anytime to go to Midvale deli (I think the shop was at Midvale) and get food. The deli closed at 8pm.
