Going to lavatory found the toilet seat and rear all smeared with feces. Miss W. must have been in again. While I was cleaning up she appeared at the door. I told her she'd have to wait until I had cleaned up her mess. When half-dressed I asked if the bell had rung. "Yes." So I hurried to finish dressing. Miss M. said I could be served if half an hour late. Finally dressed, went down to breakfast. No jelly at my place. So I got up and went to another table and found jelly. Table nearly cleared but toast at my plate. Began to eat then realized the toast was buttered (I am not allowed butter) on another plate and took it.
