["Marching as to war."] I am in a classroom of adults. We are studying a play. The young woman who wrote the play is across the room. She asks me if a character in her play is named similar to the title, which is "And Sun Comes" I think about it, wondering if there was a character named summer. But I decide it is a trick question and no characters were named after the title. Suddenly we must go to war. We file out of the classroom. A woman friend and I pack up a suitcase and then decide it is too much to carry and leave it, with the intent of picking it up later. We march down a road. After a long time, we stop. I wonder if we should return and get the suitcase before we get so far away we can't. We realize it is already too far. It would be ridiculous to return to the suitcase and then do the journey again. We march on. We come to a University. I steal a roll of toilet paper and put it in my backpack. We will have to survive on what we find. I hope no one catches us.
