I was with a boy. Later I was in a room. I dressed in a woman's dress, and I went into the next room to view myself in the mirror. The skirt had pleats in it. When I came to the mirror, I danced lightly and let the skirt twirl around my legs. I felt a thrill. Then I noticed that a nun was sitting nearby looking my way. I was embarrassed, and I left the room.
