["Jake sings Opera"]  I am in a room, dressing. Ernie comes to the door and I am only in a long sweat shirt, no undies or pants. I feel self-conscious.  At least the shirt is long enough to cover my private parts. He comes in and we talk. We are going somewhere. Two men are working outside the open window. As we start to leave, I become concerned that I should lock the window so no one will come in and steal anything. I say apologetically to the men, it's not that I think you will steal anything. We go out into the hall and then drop down through a hole which is like an elevator shaft without the elevator. We land on a piece of furniture in someone's living room. I am embarrassed. They look at us. I apologize saying we thought we were going to land in a lobby or something like that. We go outside. Some woman had driven a car down this road and we were looking for her. I think she is up in a tall building with lots of windows. Now we are in another room, like a bar. Lots of people. Some of the people are doing amateur talent skits and songs. I see Jake off to the left back corner and he is playing a record or tape of classical music. He manipulates the tape with his right hand. Then he bursts into operatic song. It is kind of silly and I am impressed with his native ability. I am surprised he had the courage to do this, as he hates to make a fool of himself. I applaud and shout out  Bravo! Some man on my right thinks Jake sounds silly and I am silly for applauding him.
