I'm visiting another artist in his home. He seems to be wealthy because his house is huge. It is modernist, white, with a large sunlit room with a large table with his drowns spread out - some are in a big pile. They are all in different media. I'm there as either a tutor or a student. There is a crate of his work - it's like a tutorial. He is confident. His work is technically very advanced, but I'm not so sure his work has soul.
