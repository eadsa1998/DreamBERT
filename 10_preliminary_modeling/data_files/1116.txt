I'm in a store, on the ground floor. I buy something. I go to the elevator and go up to the 3rd floor. I get out and realize that I really wanted the 1st floor all along. I go back to the elevator. I pick up things I had dropped. I have lots of dollar bills and change loosely hanging out of my pockets. I pick up crochet hooks, knitting needles, and yarn. My crutches are upside down, in a corner. As I get to 1st floor, I see Patsy. She wants to talk. At first, I don't really want to listen but then I don't mind helping out.
