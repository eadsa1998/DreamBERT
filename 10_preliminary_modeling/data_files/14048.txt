I was on Chris Barrie's IMDb page. I downloaded a bunch of movies that he was in and I was on the message board later. He had an account and was answering questions. On his profile it said that he had "4 sons, maybe", because he had three and his wife was pregnant, and "I have had sex" and something else. It also said he had a son born in July 2003. I was telling Ezra about some movies. I watched some video of Chris Barrie and he was walking on a sidewalk with a kid in a pram. His shirt said "I -- C... B...".
