I am about to take a long journey; I spend the last hour in Mitchell's house and stay overnite; I eat breakfast with Zena, Mitchell and his friend then get ready quickly; A receptionist carries my bags to the train and is very helpful; I say my goodbyes and am more relaxed, even though I have to go to the bathroom; we laugh and I say goodbye.
