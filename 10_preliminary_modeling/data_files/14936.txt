All cinemas got closed down. There had been a warning about it and it was up to Mozilla to do whatever with it. I was angry and upset about it. I ended up at a cinema. Seamus was there and he was eating sugar and ice. If my sodium level got over '40', I would pass out. Then it wasn't me and she passed out and they said to wheel her to the doctors. I went to the doctors and she was in a dark room and I said the doctor was a pedo. He was with someone else and we attacked him and left. I was with three people and their hair had turned green and got crusty stuff on their eyes. Someone said the Vanessa/Chuck (Gossip Girl) storyline was timed well because they had good chemistry. I said 'no they don't'. In real life, Ed Westwick and Jessica Szohr were getting married. There was a scene where Chuck was talking to a guy and Vanessa snuck up behind him and wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him. Blair came and was angry and upset around it and ran off to a room. Chuck and Serena followed her. Chuck locked the door. Then I was Blair. I tried to open the door and I said we were trapped. I took my shirt off for some reason that I can't remember. I was hiding myself. There were clothes in the room but they were all female clothes and small. They tried to find something. As time went on, I got less annoyed at Chuck and started laughing and joining in with their conversation.
