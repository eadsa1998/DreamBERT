I see Mary. She is not ill, but she is very worried about Adam. In this dream he is about 4 or 5 years old -- maybe younger. All I can see of Adam is his head and face. He is badly hurt. His face is bruised and he has lumps or bumps on his head. Mary is very upset and urges that we get him to a doctor or to someone who can fix him up.
