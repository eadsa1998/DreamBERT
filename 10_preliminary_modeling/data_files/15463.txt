I went to some food place with Mom, Darren and others. We met there with some people I didn't know. There was ice-cream and chicken. They ordered for me and basically got me nothing with no ice-cream and I asked for chips and they said there weren't any. Then they said it was a long wait. I was angry and annoyed. I watched a movie on a DVD player on a TV and Mom watched a bit and thought it was interesting. Russell Crowe was in it. Then the movie was real and this guy a girl needed to get somewhere quickly and they dressed up as Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie to get to this place. I had to get through this level and at first I fell through some stuff. Then there was one with apple bits and it was hard to breathe. I was then with another girl. There was a squares game and I had to do 4 of them and I had to go first. This lady said we had to do something, but she got interrupted. They caught on that we were lying and we had to run.
