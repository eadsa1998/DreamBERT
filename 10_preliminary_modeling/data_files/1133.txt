I'm in my chair. I see a steam vent growing into a volcano. There are 5 of them. One is right at the edge of the ocean. I sit within 3 feet of it. I am annoyed that I would sit that close to danger. Then Ginny, Ernie, and I go down the road. We stop at a store. They go in. I wait. They come out and I see by their faces that they are angry and holding it in. I say, "Ah, you two need to have some space alone so you can argue it out and get over it." I then suggest that I leave. Ginny however says, "I'll go get your syrup first," and goes off. I start to protest, "It's O.K., deal with this. Don't bother with that errand," but she's gone. I ask Ernie, "What happened?" Maybe it will be helpful if he talks it out. He tells how one small incident lead to another and built up into a big deal. I try to point out that it wasn't really all Ginny's fault but he still can't see that, so I realize that I'd better let them work through it. She comes back. I look at the syrup and feel hesitant to say anything, because it's the wrong kind. It has sugar in it. I hesitantly tell her, and she feels badly. She goes to exchange it. She comes back. They won't talk about the incident. I encourage them to. Something about grandma Mildred and grandpa Lloyd in their house and then something about a baby that needs to be returned, he/she got lost.
