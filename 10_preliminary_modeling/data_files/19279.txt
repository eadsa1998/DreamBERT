I was walking to the bus stop and I was running late. I saw the bus coming and I tried to run, but I couldn't run. It was like no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't move, all I could go was in slow motion. I remember my neighbors yelling come on, you're gonna miss it, but I couldn't move. I was leaving my house in my neighborhood walking to the bus stop. I was mad that I couldn't move and mad that I missed the bus, because my dad would be on my case. It was unpleasant!
