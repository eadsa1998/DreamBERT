I had three kids. Their father was Jack Nicholson. I was about 15, but somehow they aged and I was still 15, but I wasn't. The oldest was a girl, sometimes she looked like that ugly Tanita girl, other times she was pretty and sometimes she had this scary nose. The second oldest was also a girl, and the youngest was a boy. We were playing on some big oval. When my eldest met Mom, I was 'overjoyed' and she was nervous about meeting Mom.
