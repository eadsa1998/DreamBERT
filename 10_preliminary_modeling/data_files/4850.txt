["Tragic shooting."] Charla comes downstairs and says Uncle Jake killed Dwight and wounded her. I am shocked. I am in a trance like condition from the shock and sorrow. Hours pass. I am in a kitchen. I realize I should be calling 911. I dial. I tell them, but I am crying so hard that It is hard to get it out. I hang up and wait. Then I realize that I forgot to tell them my address. I call 911 again. I tell them the address, crying again. I hang up. I wait. Then I realize I should go look and see if it is true. I go upstairs to my bedroom and partially open the door. It can't be opened fully, because Jake's body lies in the way. I see he is dead. I go back downstairs to Dwight's bedroom. I see he is dead. I go back to the kitchen and ask Charla to show her wound. She shows me two healed scars where a bullet went through just below her knee from the back to the front. Now I walk into the living room. People are arriving, to ask questions. I tell them they can move back the couch from the desk, which is in the center of the room. They do so and ask me questions. I answer from a stunned sorrow.
