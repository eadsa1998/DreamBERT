The car broke. This guy took it to his house and said that he was going to fix it. I had to get some stuff. I had a feeling he was going to kill us and I saw that Samantha and Calvin had their bags down near the garage. I asked to go to the toilet so that I could get my bag. Later, as we were getting ready to leave, he had a premonition of us leaving. We ran and it ended up just me and Calvin. We ended up at these tents. One was a pub, one had babies and one was a dinner place. The pub was gay. We went to the dinner place and Elijah, Dmitri and Seamus were there. Darius walked in and sat with Elijah and Dmitri. I was worried that the army was going to come in and the guy would get us. People at the baby place were looking for the people from A Series of Unfortunate Events. One of the babies was called Klaus. This older girl's baby was found in the woods. We were trying to find somewhere to stay. There was a Diner Dash type of dinner -- people had stars for their mood etc.
