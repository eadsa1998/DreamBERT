I am in the back of an open bed truck with a pipe frame.  Someone I don't like, or who doesn't like me, has hung a chain over the pipe at the end of the truck nearest the cab.  I am at the back of the truck.  One end of the chain is shorter than the other, and I am afraid that the chain will slip off the pipe and fall to the bed of the truck and become a snake, so I try to get off the back of the truck, but my body is sluggish and unable to move.  What I feared does happen-the chain falls down and turns into a cobra.  It sees me at the back of the truck and advances steadily toward me, its hood spread slightly.  I begin moaning very loudly and wake up with Anita shaking me.
