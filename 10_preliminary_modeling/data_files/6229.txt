Last night I dreamt that I woke up too late to take a very important exam. I woke up about 11:30 am for an exam at 11:00. Once awake, I had to check the clock and regain my senses before realizing that it was only 6:23 am and that I did not have an exam that day. I have had similar dreams before, only to realize that it was Saturday or a holiday.
