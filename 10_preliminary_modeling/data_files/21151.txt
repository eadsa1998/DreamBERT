It was either night or misty. I seemed to go up into the air. It gave me a thrill. I was up high or it seemed so. In my sleep I thought of two high horses. Ann, the kids, myself and George Lasko were walking along a swift river bank. Then George waded across and I went about halfway across and I yelled to Ann to watch the kids so they wouldn't fall into the river. The water was deep in some spots. I grabbed Audrey by the arm and she had a good size arm. Ann cleaned out one of our rooms and it was like a dance hall. I jigged or danced a few steps on the floor myself. Ann put too much coal into a stove and the pipe got red hot and the walls caught fire. I was picking up coins, pennies and a dime that was coated. I had long underwear on. I was filling a pail with water and it ran out on the bottom because there was a hole there. I looked thru a glass at some woven material.
