Dad had some kind of city meeting to go to, and Mom wanted to go to an art show, and I guess I was going to go with her. And there was something about, "Okay, this is the rule: we're going to each do our own thing and we're not going to run into each other." And so we set off on our bikes, and there was like this booth set up that we were supposed to go see, but we never really.... Oh, I know, she was going to go see her art, and afterwards we were going to do something together. And I was kind of being babysat at a fire station while she was going to look at her art. And they were doing something inside like a show thing and I got to go in and see it. And I was worried about them doing their sirens and this and that, but they said they weren't going to do that for some reason. While I was outside talking to a lady in the back, I heard three sirens, one each had two tones at different intervals, and I told her the intervals that I didn't mind. It was one broader than the usual. I don't know, but it was broader than the one that gives me nerves. So then we went inside and we got to see this show. It was kind of dark and we were all like sitting on the floor. This was this girl, she was playing taps on like a huge bugle thing, and then she had a keyboard that she was playing some jazz on, and apparently she got her right and left hands mixed up because her mother kept saying, "Wrong arm, wrong arm," or something like that. [laugh] And then there was this Indian dance that was like shaking shaker things or something. Then suddenly I was with Mom again, and we were going off to, we were going to find someplace to dance and have fun because it was a Friday night, and I don't know if we ever found a place or not. I seem to remember looking at a menu at this bar place, but it's all I can remember.
