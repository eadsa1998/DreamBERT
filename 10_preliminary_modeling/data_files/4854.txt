["Sweet romance."] I am Rosalind Russell and a sweet man like Ralph Bellamy when young. He is gently pursuing her. She smiles and flirts but shies away. She wants to go sit in a cafe and asks the waiter for a table. The waiter says You'll have to share a table with someone. She says OK. They walk into a crowded room and she laughs delightedly when she sees it is Ralph she will be with. He is also delighted and teases her. They cuddle together on a couch and she relaxes her legs around his legs. It is loving, sweet and fun.
