I am on stage. I have a special guitar for my arthritic fingers and I tease the audience about how I can't play and then I wow them with a great song. Ellie comes on stage and sits facing me at my left. Charla dances on stage and she and I do this little imitative dance of each other's movements. The audience loves us and applauds wildly. I say, "And this is my granddaughter." They applaud again. We go off stage. I can still see the audience through a tall door that was opened so the kids can see.
