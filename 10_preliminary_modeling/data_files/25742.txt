 I'm at Armstrong High School. A polio vaccine occurs. Everyone evacuates the building. I see my friend Kevin Simpson on my way outside. We slap hands and pause. He is a very young boy, 12 or 13 years old, with long straight hair. There is a countdown to the vaccine. It is unorganized. Kevin is unorganized. He runs; he has to be somewhere that he isn't. The countdown is at 14 when Kevin starts running. I go by my teacher, who can't count well, and say all different numbers instead of counting down. The vaccine occurs at 20 according to her count. I'm in a classroom as a guest. The class and teacher are friendly. They know I've graduated. I say that I'm back to observe. They say I'm tall. I say I have knee problems. I have a laptop computer that I plug into the socket in back of the desk in front of me. The male teacher, who seems to be the dominant teacher because he is in front of the class, jokes about a dream in which he loses teeth. The kids comment about my height, as does a female teacher. The female teacher says I should take off my shoes to see my height. I don't do this. She says I need to put on more weight, and get wider.
