This teen guy and his grandmother went missing on his birthday. Everyone was looking for him but then he returned with his sister. His grandmother had fallen and died of a heart attack. They had freaked out and hid. They brought back her head. Mom bought me this sea monkey stuff as a present. I opened up a packet of them and they were two small 'fish'. They were weird looking and people-y. I was trying to get the tank sorted out and there was a weird cylinder thing with a swirly thing. I got Mom and Ezra to help me and told them to be careful of the fish. The fish things were kind of sick, but one was a bit better than the other and I liked that one more. We put the water on for the other one and the good one went down the drain. I freaked out but I couldn't get it back. I almost gave up but I gave the sick one a drink and it got better. There was a photo on the back of the box of Darren and his family and they had been making these for years (since 1981). I had had a photo taken but they didn't use it.
