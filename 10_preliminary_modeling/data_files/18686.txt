There was a man living in the woods. He killed people with a knife and ate them. I was trying hard to make a plan with Rudy how we could get across the woods when the man wasn't too hungry and where he might not roam today. The man had papers from a city office that saved his right to kill and eat people. I tried to lead him away from Rudy's path with chicken legs. There was a little girl who had been living in a wooden box. 3 X 3 feet, for 7 years. She had been in concentration camp and slept in old classic cars since she was 7 years old. I was going to adopt her. The papers said I got $444 a month... I was sitting in a chair in the thrift shop next to the locked gallery. I found a bathing suit, all stretchy. Jasmine came to see me and phoned that class was cancelled. That we would have class Saturday morning.
