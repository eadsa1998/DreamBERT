[1997-05-20] I was staying at some people's house I'm not sure who they were. I don't know what state but it was far away from Connecticut. I had left on a Monday and I was taking four days and I couldn't take a fifth day without a note from a doctor because I was claiming sick time. It was just a cold and I really don't think I needed to go to a doctor so I better3 go back to work on Friday. I don't know what happened, but I never did go. I remember just being at these people's house and watching TV and listening to the radio and kind of enjoying things because I wasn't that sick, I just had a little cold.
