I was playing Scrabble with Mom and Ezra. Ezra had his turn and got 75 points, but then I looked at what he did and he had done a word connecting other words, but half of the words he had made weren't actually words. I kept having too many letters in my rack. Some band came on that I liked and they started with a 'T', but I couldn't remember who they were. It took like 1-2 hours to get to the place we were going to.
