I was in a cheap seedy motel room with Lynn.  It looked different than Thompson [Lynn owned the motel there], but the feelings were similar.  This room was darker, more dark red and burgundy colors, and there was a restaurant or tavern attached through one door.  It was kind of trashed, or had miscellaneous or broken furnishings in there.  I remember the bathroom, and it was that same feeling as the bathroom in Room 7 in Thompson, no water pressure or shower or something.  We were there for a while.  We laid down together, and Lynn started touching my breasts.  It felt so good when he touched my breasts, it was really turning me on, I asked him, don't they feel huge, or bigger?  They did to me.  I really liked what he was doing, he was stroking them and squeezing them really nice.  I was getting really aroused.  Then he got up.  I didn't want to stop.  He went into the next room, but there was a window or opening between where he was and where I was still in the bed.  I said don't you want to get undressed?  He said take off your clothes, then I'll come back in, maybe.  I asked him if he wanted to take off my clothes, or take off his clothes.  Then I recognized that feeling of trying to have sex while on drugs, when you can't keep on track with the activity, or connect with your partner, because you're both thinking about doing different things, or really wanting to maybe do something else other than sex, and it's hard to actually get started.  I got sad.
