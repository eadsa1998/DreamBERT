For a while I dreamt I was having sex with Lisa and Cara. When we were done they sort of left and I hooked the modem up to my computer and I tried to call the BBS that was toll free. I never could make it through, and I set up a large "boat-anchor" TV. And I started watching a horror movie. It seemed all this was happening in the middle of the night. In the morning (in the dream) I went to B.J.'s house. I spent the night there, and every time I went out of the room to get water or something, I'd open the wrong door somewhere and my eyes would get to feast upon dead bodies and people and animals, all dead. Once I found Alice Cooper in a room with a 50's style band crowded in around him all behind tattered white sheets. All the people's skin was blue. The next morning I walked to Guitar Showcase. They were having a party there, and a guy named Heavy Harv was hosting. I pictured Heavy Harv as a 50 year old Mexican who wore 70's style clothes, with his shirt wide open. The funny thing was, they announced they were using Steve's records! I was hanging out by the wall, talking to some chick. I have no idea who it was, because in the dream, I never actually turned my head to look at her. I ended up buying something to hold pencils that cost eighty-nine cents.
