 I'm with a group of people I know from high school. My friend Esther Thurman is there, and some of our mutual friends. We're in a gas station-like place. Someone mentions that Esther is having a baby! I look over: my view of her is partially obscured by an aisle. I see she is on the ground, fully clothed, in obvious discomfort. Someone makes a comment that makes Esther laugh. The laugh causes her to have the baby. It seems that something comes out of her birth canal though she is fully clothed. She makes painful noises, and writhes. She is then holding a baby that is five or six inches long, and very pale. It seems not fully formed or developed: an embryo. She holds it close to her head, bonding with it. I hold it. It isn't slimy like I thought it would be. It's like a doll, but more real. It shows no signs of life. There is a woman working in the gas station. I talk to her about getting something, like ice scrapers, as if we are entitled to them. I go outside with her and she takes two large plastic ice scraper-like objects from a vehicle, and gives them to me. I know she is stealing. I hurry to our vehicle, hoping the others come quickly. The others do come, but a man also comes claiming we have his ice scrapers. The scrapers are on the front passenger seat. We deny that we have them. I grab a hat or scarf and throw it on top of the scrapers near my feet. The man comes and looks, but leaves thinking we don't have them. We drive. Someone in our car is fleeing, maybe from that man.
