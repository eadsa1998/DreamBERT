A man and I are attracted to each other. I kiss him and curl up on his lap. We roll over onto the floor and are starting to make love when we hear "the family" coming into the room. We break apart, but aren't quick enough to get up off the floor. The head of the family (sort of Grandad Lloyd) is shocked and lectures us. We get up and the entire large family sits around a round dining table. And I lecture them on better communication skills, araphrasing, body language, etc. They find me unbelievable. They stare at me uncomprehendingly.
