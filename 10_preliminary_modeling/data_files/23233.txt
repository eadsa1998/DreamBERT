Possibly earlier in the previous dream, possibly in another dream, I needed to take a shower in someone's house and change clothes.  My clothes were spread out on a shelf in the back of a car or in the above-mentioned streetcar.  With difficulty, I located some underwear, but I couldn't find a clean shirt and pants.
