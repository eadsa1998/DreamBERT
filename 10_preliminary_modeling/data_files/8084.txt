I was either in a hotel room or a second floor apartment. Bill C was there. I think Daddy was there. I may have just been talking to him. Sister Emma was in the dream at one point. Carmen A and Alison U were in the dream at one point. I think maybe two other people from school were in the dream. but I'm not sure. I said, Look did you see that Carmen A and Alison U are here? I must have said that to someone who knows them. Alison U was pregnant. In part of this dream Sister Emma lived on the 2nd floor of this apartment building or this hotel and there was a man living right beneath her on the first floor. At one point it seems that they traded places, maybe because of Sister Emma health. So she was now living, or staying on the first floor. The man was now living on the second floor. There were metal stairs leading to the second floor. I went up the stairs and it led to a roof, I think. They had taken and put a bunch of dirt and planted some trees so you weren't limited to. Maybe so you could only access one part of the roof. I just went up there and I looked around a little bit. I looked over the edge and down to the street level. Then I went back down. I think maybe I told someone that I just wanted the exercise. Now I'm living on the first floor I guess. There was something about Alison U having a doctor's appointment. She had four suitcases full of stuff, even though it was just an overnight doctor appointment. I was helping her carry all of her stuff. I am talking to Bill C and Cole P about cell phones. There was one kind of cell phone that Bill C was using. I said, Oh, yes, I have that exact same one at home. But this is the one I carry around with me. I pulled out my current phone. Bill C and Cole P both pulled there's out and we were all comparing. I was thinking that mine was little bit smaller and that mine was nicer than theirs but I didn't say that.
