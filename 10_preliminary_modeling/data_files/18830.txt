I dreamt my 6-month-old niece was eating a big chicken leg (fried). I was alone with her and she started choking on it. I tried to get the chicken leg out of her hand, but she wouldn't let go. Her coughing was loud and deep, like a man's. I was running around the house looking for something to stop the cough, but I never found anything. I was pretty frantic about the whole thing. <br/
