I'm on a ferry to the Vineyard with six of my friends. I'm walking on the beach with a hot red bathing suit. This faceless man approaches me and we go for a drink at a pub on the beach. My two friends walk in and give me a look with a smirk on their faces. I'm on Cloud 9 because I've met the man of my life. Then I go into the hotel to get changed for my date with this man. Then he comes to the hotel with flowers. I'm riding high on Cloud 9 now. Then we walk on the beach and a tidal wave washes him away.
