I dreamt about leaving my boyfriend Jeremy's house in the morning to go visit him (?)  I went through the forest running, and then starting to fly when I couldn't go fast enough.  Then I was jumping on the car watching myself in the mirror.  I went inside and Jeremy asked if I'd stay the whole time.  We curled up on the bed and watched a DVD he had of Smurf commercials.  It was like animated feathers, made of paper.  Then I was setting up my Care Bears in a bathroom stall.
