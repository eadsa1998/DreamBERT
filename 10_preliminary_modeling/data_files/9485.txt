I am teaching something; long and slow progress. I am fairly content at home. Rhoda and others at the house: Rhoda says (in answer to our wanting to rent a room) "You'd get all those people who want to bury themselves living at your house... all the derelicts etc. people who have nothing else to do. She laughs. I point to pink blossom on tree: hopefully. Someone says: The tree has cancer," but I don't believe it.
