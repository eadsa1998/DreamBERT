I was watching Big Brother. Ben was the only one I recognized. There was an ugly old lady on there (she was about 40) who was interested in Ben or this other, uglier guy. Ezra was like "how the hell does she have a chance with Ben?". This Big Brother wasn't letting them have any fun. They had a small TV and they weren't allowed to have one-on-one conversations. Then it wasn't Big Brother. This guy from the house took Ben and some guy to lunch at this restaurant. It was a big, shiny, black building with lots of windows. A van drove past, and the van along with the building had CRS on it [referencing The Game I suppose]. I couldn't remember where it was from. Then the guy left. They blew up the building from the top storey down. Ben and the guy decided to risk it and jumped out a window. They were ok and were relieved and then saw matches scattered around and so they ran. Every time they got away there would be more matches. They ran through this forest and throwing sticks behind them and I was also running with them. At the end of the path, which was then in a building, we turned around with sticks out to defend ourselves at the same time. No-one was there and we laughed. But then this guy started throwing random stuff and we had to do certain things to stop them. Then Ezra was there. There was a fast ball and this guy kicked it and I said "Go Kenny!". The guy thought for a minute and then rolled a slow ball, I missed it and everyone was wondering how and I said that I thought it was going to be fast and got confused and we laughed.
