I dreamed I was in a room, I think it was a livingroom, talking to a woman, maybe somebody from church, about classical music, and I was walking across the room carrying a big pop bottle, like a 2 liter bottle only bigger, quite a bit bigger, I was carrying it vertically in front of me, walking across, and she was telling me that her husband likes classical music and I said "I love classical music, especially music that's soft and seductive, and I used to hate classical music" and then we named a couple of programs and she said he liked "The Black Jar" and I had never heard of that program, but in the dream I said "oh yeah, I like that program too" and I started to tell her that I liked a program, I said "Hearts in Space" but that wasn't the name of it5/20/97.
