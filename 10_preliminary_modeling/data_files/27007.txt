I was lying on my stomach, dressed in blue jeans and a shirt in the hallway leading to the kitchen. The phone is in the hallway and I was with two others, a boy and another girl. The boy was on the phone and was blocking the way to the lavatory. I had an intense urge to defecate but felt considerable embarrassment in going into the bathroom at this time. Consequently, I held down my urge as long as possible, and then went into my pants. It was hard enough to remain intact and when I got up I went upstairs to dispose of it in the bathroom up there. The bathtub was full of water which somebody had left after bathing. 1 wanted to take a bath but felt that I needed clean water. The rest of the dream fades at this point. Somehow I took my bath and I believe I changed the water.
