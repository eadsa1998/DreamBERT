["How assertive are you?"] I am in a building. I am going to teach an English Composition class. It is 8 o'clock, time to start but none of the students have arrived. Even Burt Lancaster, who usually is on time. I wait a few minutes and then decide to go upstairs to the classroom and start class. If no one shows up, I will cancel the class. But at the last minute, the students show up and I teach. Now I am traveling down a road, a very straight and narrow road looking for a small town in the mountains. I don't remember it's name, but it starts with a T. Maybe Times. I guess I find it as I am now teaching a small group in assertiveness. I am in some room. I go around the circle. I ask each person what percent of their time do they behave in an assertive way. One woman says three quarters of her time. Another says not very much. One man refuses to answer. I hems and haws and says "I don't know," I get very insistent and will not go on until he answers me. Finally he grudgingly says Not too much. Then he asks me for my answer. I think and then say, Three quarters.
