I was in some garage, and there were two bears after me.  I tried swimming across something there, but one of them swam after me.  Even when I climbed up on a ledge, they could still just touch my feet.  I threw a small steel ball at one but missed.  I had a revolver in my hand, and there were some boxes of shells on a workbench, so I asked John Rayne to throw me a box.  He started rummaging through them but couldn't find the right ones.  Soon he and the bears went away, and I got down and advanced cautiously to the workbench, where I got some shells.  They were flat paper or cardboard with a hole through the middle and lined with cork on one side.  I then retreated to my former position but couldn't load the gun.  While I was there, a man came by in a car (a convertible) with the same kind of gun and demanded my money.  He said he knew I had $100, because he could see it sticking out of my pocket.  Actually it was only a $5.  I got down and went to the car and got about $30 out of my wallet.  But then I started asking him how he had fallen into this racket, etc., and kept him talking.  I asked him if he could show me how to load the gun, and he did.  Then I pointed the gun at him and told him to scram.  But he pointed his at me, and when I pulled my trigger the gun didn't fire.  He pointed out that I had the safety on.  Soon he seemed to be Martha Watson, and I still kept her talking.  After asking her what church she went to, I put my arms around her and kissed her.  Everything turned out OK.  I went in to Grandpa's house and told them the story.
