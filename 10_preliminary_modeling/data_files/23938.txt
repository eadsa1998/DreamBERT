There's a contest and I am a contestant. I'm standing on stage with 4 other girls...2 Americans and 2 Russians. I'm wearing a huge poofy dress. I can't believe I'm in the contest because the winner is supposed to go on to the Miss Teen something or other. I whisper to the 2 Americans that I know who the winner is (one of the Russians). They announce the winner and it's ME. I can't believe it. Supposedly I'm the prettiest girl there. I think this sucks because I didn't want to win because I dont want to be in any Miss Teen crap. <br/
