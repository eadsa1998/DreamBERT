Silly Hat, Bath Time. Ginny and Ernie are there and they are my gentle, caring, loving helpers. Ellie and I are there. My mother is there. I reach into a box of hats and put some on my head. I put a silly one on, green and white variegated yarn like a snug child's hat and the yarn ends close all around my face. I laugh and go show my mother. Ellie says, "I thought those were sleepers for Charla in that box." I said, "Don't worry, they are in the other box." Now it's time for my bath. My mother prepares it. I see Ellie putting Desiden on the diapers for Charla. My mother pays her every time she does it, in effect bribing her to take better care of her daughter. Oh well, at least it works. I see a man, a friend, we are very affectionate. He is getting ready to go back to his hunting hole. He says I have to build up some sweat so I can be a better hunter. I ruffle his hair affectionately like a boy's and smile. I say, "Hopefully you'll take a bath so I can get within 30 yards of you." I pause and then rush to reassure him, "I mean before the wedding, not now." He grins and says teasing, "Maybe I'll just stand 31 yards away." Somehow he is asserting his need to be true to his nature. I am trying to accommodate that. He leaves and I get in the bath. There is lots of soap. I realize it has been feeling good to take a bath every morning like I've been aroused to get me going. She's leaving today and I think, "I wish I'd continue this on my own without her there, gently pushing me," but I realize sadly I probably won't.
