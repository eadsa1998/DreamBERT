I was watching It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Dee entered a weight lifting competition and got Dennis, Mac and Charlie to help. For every level they went up, more weights were added and it got to a ridiculous amount. They edited something so much there was so resemblance. She asked for help again. I think Terry Jones was asked to lift weights and he said "no I'm fucking not". I said [someone] might like that, and I meant to get the guys to kiss him. Later, I was at home and Mom was on the computer. Dee came and told me something and he clapped. I said it was my idea, saying "bromance". Mom and Darren laughed but were confused about it. An old friend of Mom's came over and so did Meyer. Someone mentioned a movie with two guys and I said "Jason Segel!" (talking about I Love You, Man).
