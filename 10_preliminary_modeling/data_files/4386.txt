["Saved from the monster."] I am camping with Dovre. We find a spot and leave the vehicle and walk to another spot. Tall beautiful trees. We are waiting for my parents to join us. A man comes by and shows us a cute squirrel in a tree. He feeds them. He asks to borrow my nightshirt I am wearing. I let him have it and also take off my underpants. Then I feel exposed and ask Dovre to go to the other camp and bring my jeans. She doesn't want to go so she gives me a spare jeans and shirt of hers. I realize later that saved my life because my night shirt was given to a monster who came looking for my scent and would have eaten me if I'd worn my own clothes.
