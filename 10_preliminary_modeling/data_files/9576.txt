In Vienna: city being renovated: plaster over metal fronts. I see towers of churches and one tower with a rooster against a blue sky. I go into a store: elevator: I punch the buttons and call on a telephone: man from different country (Iraq?) tells me he loves me. I return and say goodbye to him. Then ride to the mountains and down into the valley. Lots of traffic. Back in the city I go to an Orthodox Church and take communion. I look for Frank. I see him in another service; later on he is on a bus, reading to a girl, after taking Communion. His eyes sparkle but he is a bit embarrassed, also worried as to where I had been. Continue riding the bus...
