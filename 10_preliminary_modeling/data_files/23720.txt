Dreamed I was in jail, lots happening.  I decided to go shower, went into a big tent or something, was getting my stuff together for shower, turned back to my mat where I had dropped my stuff, and written 'in water', or in the patterns that water makes on a mat, was all this info about me, the kinds of relationships I get into, who I am.  Lots of writing.  I read it and turned to a man to my left (sort of behind me) who was sitting on his mat, and I said, "Do you know me?"  I was really surprised at how accurate the writing in water on the mat had been, about my unhealthy relationships.  He looked at me and said - "Yes, I am your guide.  I am here to assist you through your life."  Think he said his name was Bill, and I thought of Bill K.  Then he laughed outrageously - saying "Get that!  I am your guide, ha ha ha."  In a joyous way but totally outrageous, not really appropriate.  I became skeptical at his reaction and also his bluntness.  By this time I felt more trance than dream - like and I asked to pull out, I couldn't handle this.  I pulled out, and felt as I did a definite feeling of another consciousness occupying my mind and leaving.  There was a rushing in both ears, a full feeling in my head, then feeling that consciousness pulling out.  [Note Jan/2012 - In fall of 1989, without intending to, I did channel in a being who behaved and spoke to me as my spiritual guide. It was quite a momentous experience for me, so for the next few years, before sleeping, I sometimes asked for him to return. The dream above was humorous in its mockery of the original experience.]
