Benjamin asked to meet up, 'do you want to go out?', and we went to the beach near Dad's. We actually managed to talk, but he looked different (I didn't actually notice that in the dream though. We went up to see Dad. The place was different and all of it was inside (joined by halls). There were lemons for $5. There was a lady at the counter and I said I'd get some later, but I wasn't going to because it was too expensive. Ezra had to wait for the neighbours to leave before he could leave because he'd annoyed them by being loud.
