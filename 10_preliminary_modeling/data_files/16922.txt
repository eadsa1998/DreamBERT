I'm in a very crowded stadium with a trench all around the edge. The whole place seems to be full of people I don't know. I don't know why we are here. There;s no seats - there's just a large area of grass. I have a sleeping bag which I take out and I want to lie in it, but I'm too shy to do it in front of all these people. So I walk around looking for a nook or a cranny to set up my sleeping bag in.
