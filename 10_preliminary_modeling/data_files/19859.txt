I was a mental patient. The men were being moved into the women's ward, and the women were being moved into the men's ward. I saw my sister as a patient. Then I saw a man and a woman patient being intimate. Someone told me that the women were being moved into the men's ward because it was next to the hospital ward (for medical treatment). They would not have to pass through the men's ward to get to the hospital ward.
