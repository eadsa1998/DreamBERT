I came out of a store to find that a policeman (about 40 years old) was putting a ticket on my father's car. I got in the car behind my father's in order that I might drive it away before the policeman placed a ticket on it. The policeman got on his motorcycle and pushed the car backwards. I immediately moved forward and crashed through a pink light. Then I found myself trying to drive the car down a narrow aisle in the 5 &amp; 10 cent store. A cashier asked me to leave and I did. I got out on the sidewalk and the car was transformed into a bicycle which I rode down the sidewalk. I passed an Army Surplus Store outside of which four girls (in their 20's I would say) were modeling army fatigue outfits.
