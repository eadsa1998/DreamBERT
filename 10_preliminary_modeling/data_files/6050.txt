Last night's dream was a strange one. I was outside, but I do not know where I was.  I was with my best friend and this kid she is starting to date. He is this kid we have known for about three years. The whole dream was not a complete story. It was just different scenes. I went from being at a friend's house with my friend and the kid she is seeing; to being at the Bruins game with just me and him. We were having a great time. Then in the next scene, we were at a wedding, but I did not know the people who were getting married. It was so strange. I was also in an ugly dress which I would never wear. It was gaudy and fitted and strange. The kid I was with gave me a grin which I absolutely could not stand. Then we were at my school and he was kissing another friend of mine. Then I woke up. It was very strange.
