Dad, Ezra and I were driving to Nana's. We were low on fuel. We turned down a road and ended up at this weird place. There was a big monster thing which laid golden eggs. There was a bed and a girl called Helen Collins. There was guy and a girl in a gorilla suit. Mr Norris had a girlfriend and gave someone $600. This adopted kid got $1267 and he was naughty. I was at the Gold Coast and someone was talking about making choices.
