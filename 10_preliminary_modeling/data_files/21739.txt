I heard someone call, "John Evans, you are next in for this bargain." Marie Lasko was baking cakes and bakery. I said alright, so I took a few cakes. I saw just plain John. I looked at it twice and that all there was. We were standing around Auto in the tool room listening to a speaker over the PA or radio. Then we went to the locker room to change clothes. I was dragging or pulling a coke over scraper to the coke yard to drown one over of coke. There was snow on the ground and we had to shovel it. I got a wide shovel to do it. A lady asked me for a safety pin so I gave her two and she put them on a string of them. She was saving them. I gave Ann a bunch of tools pliers and my wrist watch for a present.
