I was walking in the colored section of Coconut Grove looking for a grocery store to buy some milk. I noticed an old high school English teacher of mine walking there also. (I wasn't surprised to see him) and he began to accompany me. He asked whether I thought it was wise to be walking naked, and then I realized (again nor surprise) that I had no clothes on. Only slight surprise, neither p or unp, no color
