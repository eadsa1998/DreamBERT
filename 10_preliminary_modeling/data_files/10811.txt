Subject was on a double date going to a hotel party. For some reason the boys had to remain downstairs and another girl who is really good friend of subject and subject started upstairs in a self-operating elevator. They had difficulty getting the right floor and after riding up and down several times, found it finally. They entered the ballroom together and felt quite lonely for quite a while until boys finally arrived. Girls were much relieved.
