[1997-05-03] I'm at work in the office of a rehab teacher named D, a transistor radio is on, I held it in my hand and placed it on my desk. They were talking about a thousand dollar contest you could win if you listen use UPS, but they're calling it a 'star program'. D said that she was already entered and was hoping to won the prize. I hadn't entered yet but I thought to myself that I was hoping that it wasn't too late to do that.
