All I remember is walking alone up a road near my former home - up through silent streets in the twilight till the last glow faded to gray. I walked till I was away from houses &amp; out in the empty fields, not thinking, just feeling the rhythm of the walk and the relaxed feeling. I think I had felt very worried as I started - I don't know about what, but as it became dark I turned to go home, feeling tired &amp; subdued but rather exalted.
