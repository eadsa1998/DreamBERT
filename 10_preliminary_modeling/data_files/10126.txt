First we ride along the sea side with Wendy and her friend Ed; he says: "I have exchanged the eccentricities of the artist for the comforts of home" -- we ride around in a car and end up at a Christmas party: I plan to decorate the tree, but we have given away our lights, so we don't have lights on the tree. The party is stilted; no fun; I notice a broken arm rest on a worn couch and that the wall paper is torn. I am surprised that these people (friends? neighbors? live in such a shabby place.
