Sod had been laid around a dark brown windmill.  I and some others, including I think my father had done some new landscaping.  The owner asked how we thought it looked and I said I didn't think the new plant's shade of green went with the brown.  I tried to straighten some of the sod.  We went into the windmill and sat to play games.  We decided to go look briefly at something outside again.  The doorway was met with grass.  The owner (female) insisted that a particular vine be cut right away, rather than waiting for tomorrow.  This vine had wrapped around the mill and hung partially in the doorway, which is why we thought she wanted it cut.  We couldn't understand her urgency but complied.  I started tugging on the vine.  It was thick, about an inch in diameter.  I pulled on it, trying to loosen it and track it around the mill so we could cut it near the base.  It was alive, and poisonous- that's why it had to be cut.  Somehow I got hold of a 2-foot length, folded over.  The end in my right hand was split, and it was wormlike, wiggling around, reaching and trying to grab my wrist.  It felt disgusting and I couldn't wait to get rid of it.  I yelled to my father to bring scissors or something.  He didn't understand the urgency behind it.
