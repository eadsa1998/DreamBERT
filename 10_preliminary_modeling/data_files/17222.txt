Our cat Nina was lying in the rumpus room on her back.  I was going to look at her stomach- it was red and bloated.  As I walked toward her, she said, "Mommy, Mommy".  My dad was sitting on the couch behind me.  I asked him if he'd heard.  I picked Nina up and she perched on my arm before falling off.
