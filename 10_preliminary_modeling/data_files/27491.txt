It was a beautiful summer morning. I was working for a nursery school, and it was up to me to pick up one certain child and walk with her to school. The child was about two years old and had dark curly hair. As we walked along we stopped into each house along the way to receive what might be called little hand-outs. The child was getting tired and I began skipping houses. By the time we got to the school I was carrying the child in a knapsack hanging on my left shoulder. The next thing I remember I was on my own street. There was a garden party on our front lawn and all the neighbors were gathered. I was told to go down the street to deliver something to a house which was five houses from a house I knew well, but I was afraid I wouldn't be able to find it.
