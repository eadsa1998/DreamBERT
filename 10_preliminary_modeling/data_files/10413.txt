I am in a restaurant with table cloths and waiters not like the Book Cafe, I talk with Margaret and Patrick. I ask for the food that Margaret has ordered and the waiter brings me a beautiful white porkchop and a small potato; I say "I will put the equivalent $$ for this meal into the tips jar at the Book Cafe." They like the idea. Later I act as a therapist to Patrick, he is upset about an ecumenical service that was held the day before. I suggest that persons from the Book Cafe go to various different Churches and sing hymns from the Lutheran book of worship, TAIZE songs, chants from the Orthodox Church, etc. I regret that people stay so fixed in their own denomination. At one point Patrick picks me up and raises me high up to the rafters of the ceiling.... ++ feeling.
