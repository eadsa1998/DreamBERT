 I'm with my friend Estban Ramos. We're grocery shopping. We're trying to decide what to buy. I tell him to get a couple blocks of cheese, but I'm not sure he'll get it right. We are also buying meat: sausage. I think I may put the bacon back, and maybe the sausage too. I think I'll have to get a gallon of milk. The store is like Hornbackers in Big City where I went shopping with my friend Nate Nelling. We meet man and a younger woman. They start talking with us, throwing in bits of German in the conversation. I know a few words. I know to hop-hupfen.
