 I'm in a barrack-like structure. I show a man where his bed is: next to mine. He has a body sheet wrapped around him for a sleeping bag. I have a small trash bin near my bed. The man has a sleeping bag. I'm outside sleeping. It's dark. I awaken. My friends Niles and Tim Zelling are there, in sleeping bags. I'm lying down in shallow water in a sleeping bag; the water comes up to my neck . I take big gulps of the water. Tim says he wouldn't drink the water because it's muddy. It's kind of muddy; I drank before I stirred up the mud on the bottom. There is lake to my left, and a bleacher-like area where people have gathered. Police are there. I leave the area I'm in and creep through the bushes on a path that turns towards the people. I see a tennis ball on the ground. I get pinesap on my hand as I walk; it brushed up against a tree. It's a well-lit night: the moon must be out, though I don't see it. I see the Brimson crew team on the lake. My friend Tom Napper is coxing. They row fast. They approach the shore, not slowing, and scrape the boat up onto the rocky beach. The boat they row has two main aluminum hulls, like and elongated pontoon. The Brimson golf team is playing near the shore. My classmate Katie Grendvig hits a drive. I feel like giving a verbal commentary, a play-by-play, of what is happening. I have a good feeling, being out on an illuminated night.
