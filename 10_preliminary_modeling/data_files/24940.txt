 I go to the Grease Pit to see my friend Matt and get some food. I walk up to the place from outside and say "hey" to Matt. He says "hey" back. I see a lady in a white shirt that I think is his supervisor. Then I'm inside the building. Matt and I talk and he asks me if I want any food. I don't know if he means free food, like usual, or not, since the lady is there. She is frying mushrooms in a fryer instead of French Fries. There is a line up of cars but neither of them are doing much. They take one order and I hand it to a guy through he drive up window after about five minutes. The man is angry and asks me a question. I answer honestly and he speeds around the building to ask the white-skirted lady the same question, only to get the same answer. Matt and I talk about trading subs for burgers, but I don't know what kind, or what size, sub I have. They are closing, and the woman is sweeping the floor in back. The cars are still lined up.
