I met Lilly H and Tonya H for breakfast. As they came in to the restaurant they were going to sit across the table from me. Each leaned over the table for a hug before sitting down. The table was wide so it wasn't much of a hug. As I did so with Tonya H I thought that probably wasn't very good for her and probably wasn't the best thing for my back.
