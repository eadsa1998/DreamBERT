In this dream Christmas Cove, Maine, seashore et al. is apparently relocated in Nevada. The dreamer and several friends are building cstles in the beach sand. The ocean surf breaking on the beach hurls pebbles at the castles whereupon the dream subjects cast the stones back into the surf. Some force impels the people to cast the stones back into the surf. The subject's father arrives on the beach and requests subject to accompany him on a visit to hospitalized woman, a mutual friend. Subject's father uses helicopter as mode of travel. Visit to woman who has been hospitalized because of skiing accident is cut short because of previous hunting plans with father, who in real life never hunts. The last impression of dream is flying over heavily wooded timberland with (subject and father) in the helicopter. The entire dream was in color, but the most vivid color appeared when the timberland appeared in the dream.
