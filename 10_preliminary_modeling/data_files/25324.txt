 I'm in a grocery store with my friend Tiny Combs. We go to the frozen foods section. There are packages of frozen chewing tobacco. A lady wants to get some for her husband. We go to the cash register. There is a line. We move to a register where there is one lady in front of us. We have huge peaches, which are long and cylindrical shaped, like a two-liter bottle. We have a bunch of apricots. Tiny gets a single banana, which go mixed up with the groceries of the lady in front of us. The cashier put the banana back with our food. The cashier rings up the apricots one by one. She takes each and tears the skin off a little bit, and then scans it. I say, "Wait! You can't do that! I'm not going to buy apricots if they're all torn up. They'll go bad!" I tell her I want new apricots. I talk to the manager. I do something out in the parking lot, which is where the old Simon's Grocery Store is in Oak Valley. A different, more powerful manager, gives me a bag to get more apricots. I walk through people's yards, and get the apricots. There are three men beating each other, fighting. They seem crazy. One of them yells at me to come over and fight with them. I am scared. I walk away slowly so as not to agitate them, then I run. I pick up beer cans and put them on top of the apricots. There is a leaky can, making the bag soggy. I drop the bag; the bottom may fall out of the bag. I run back to the store. Tiny and I and my mom are going to drive down to Brimson from Wilmerton. Tiny climbs up on my mom's bed. He is eager to go. He huddles beside my mom. I talk about who will drive. I say Tiny can drive, but I want to. I want to drive.
