 I'm living in a place with many other people. My friends Stephen and Jose Ramos are there. Stephen is defecating. I see him through a crack in the wall as I walk by. Jose and I both need to defecate. I use the bathroom after Stephen. The toilet is very wobbly and shaky. There is urine on the front part of the toilet seat. My friend Norman Noman is there.
