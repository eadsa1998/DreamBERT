I had a dream about one of my girlfriends here at school. She was roller skating down a hill and couldn't stop when she came to the street and saw a car coming. The car hit her and knocked all her front teeth out. She had gold teeth put in to replace them. The next scene took place in MP's dining hall where she was waiting to eat dinner. She was all decked out in slinky clothes, including an inch of mascara and makeup and false eyelashes. Somehow her boyfriend was there too and when he saw her, he exclaimed over how terrible she looked and said he'd never go out with her again. All she could say was that she couldn't help it. The roller skates wouldn't stop.
