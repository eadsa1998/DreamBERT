I am in a convent getting a schedule of events, only the convent is more like a beauty shop. I meet Sister Rosita and learn she is the one I had in grade school and hated. I thank her and tell her she is the reason I now have a Ph.D. I tell her she was so mean I was going to show her I wouldn't live up to her bad predictions about me. She is now nice and doesn't seem as old as she did then and we part friends.
