I had the strangest dream. I don't remember how it started or where I was. All I know is that I was driving down the highway in this metallic blue space mobile. This highway wasn't any ordinary highway. It was as if I was driving down a road that was all speckled with diamonds and gold. As I drove down this shimmery highway this weird looking fungus began to grow up to the sky all on the sides of the highways. They were all different colors with polka-dots and amazing swirls on them. It was like the car wasn't moving but the road was. The highway began to shimmer even brighter and the fungus grew higher to the sky. As I looked up at the sky, it looked like a kaleidoscope of all different shapes and colors. Weird hissing sounds surrounded me. Rays of colors beamed through the windshield, practically blinding me. The car began to swerve and the kaleidoscope sky turned black. My clothes began to glow and then I woke up.
