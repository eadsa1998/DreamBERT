Clark Kent (Smallville) was with me and a group of people. We were at this place with all these dark rooms. People were hiding in them. We were going into them and in one of the rooms, something moved. Ben Affleck was in this pile of toys. We hit him in the head with a hammer and it broke and he was fine.
