I had a feeling I was home but the surroundings did not seem to be familiar. Mother, Daddy &amp; I had just finished supper. Mother had made a delicious apple pie. The crust was "utter perfection." Mother then went upstairs to made some telephone calls. I was to do the dishes. I sat talking to Daddy for a long while, however. Then I looked at my watch, saw that it was 7:30 pm, and decided that I had better get the dishes done before I left. I believe as I remember it that I had to be at some special place a little later in the evening. Daddy came out into the kitchen to help me. He got mad when he found out that I had put the remainder of the pie (not in a pie pan but in a bread pan) back into the oven. He said that the crust would get hard &amp; tough. The gas was not on, however, and the door was open. I saw no difference in the outward appearance of the pie. Mother came down then and told us about the exorbitant prices they had charged for food in restaurants on New Year's Eve. I remember only one place &amp; price she quoted. The SSS had charged 35 cents for a dab of mayonnaise and liver paste on a cracker.
