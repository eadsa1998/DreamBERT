I was with other men. There were frame buildings like barracks. One did not have a basement and was several feet from the ground. Someone had put some feces under there. Everyone inside wondered where the odor was coming from. Later I was on a hill. Some material was there to stop erosion. I wanted to get to the bottom so I could go to the restroom and urinate. I slid down the hill, and my body made a groove. I was worried about the groove causing erosion. (When I awoke, I related the feces and urine to the body and blood, bread and wine, dandruff and sweat, snow and rain, wood and fire.) A creation, like a baby.
