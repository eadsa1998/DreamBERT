 Something supernatural is occurring. I have an image of humans fighting some kind of critter. It is cold and snowy. Later, I am in a vehicle with two other people. We're being followed but we have a head start. I am very anxious. I keep saying loudly and impatiently, "We must go! We must drive fast!" We lose the road that we are following in town. I say take any road, just keep driving to get away!
