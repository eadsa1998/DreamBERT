I dreamt that I was surrounded by a bunch of people. Some I knew, some were relatives and others I'd never seen in my entire life. They were all walking around talking. It was kind of like a party. The only problem was that I was deaf and when someone said something to me, their mouth moved, but no sound came out. And whenever I tried to speak, nothing came out and they looked at me like I was crazy. The whole dream when I was walking around, I seemed to be looking for someone. But I didn't know who or why. After a while I started getting frantic. I couldn't find them. People started drifting away, kinda disappearing. Then all of a sudden I woke up.
