Mom and I went for a drive to see Acquaintance-F-06 and some lady. Mom got me to go by myself. She gave me $400 in $50 notes and I also had a $20 and a $10 for petrol. I went and there were heaps of people. They tried to take my money and said I was weak. This guy was next to this other guy who was smoking. I said "yeah, but you don't know how far I'd go". He had a gun. I took the guys smoke and put it into his face. I got my money back and left. They followed me. I got to Mom and we left but we still had to do the deal. We went to an abandoned ice-cream shop? We went to the top floor and there was a little door/window leading out. They came and Mom told them I would do the deal. They came to me and I said I'd still do it. They agreed and we ending up laughing and hanging out.
