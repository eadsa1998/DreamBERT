 I'm in a movie theatre. There is space between the screen and front seats. There are rows of seats that run perpendicular to the screen, on the sides of the space between the screen and the front rows. I know that these seats on the sides are Aquarius seats. I may be poked in the back by a foot. I hear my name. I turn around and see several young women sitting behind me. The woman directly behind me is the one that said my name. She talks to me, saying her name is Amanda _____, that I know her, and seems to ask if I don't remember her. She looks familiar. She is pretty. She has fair, clean skin. I look at her face, trying to identify, to place her. She looks a bit like my cousin Sandra Redding. There are several businessmen to our left. They talk loudly and obnoxiously for a theatre. They move up towards the screen. One of them flips over a chair, like a somersault. The others jump and tumble. They gather in front of the screen, talking loudly. One of them pulls out a handgun and points it at the head of another. There are between three and five men. The man fires the gun, shooting the second man in the head. The second man may fire back. Several of the men then have guns drawn and point them at each other. One man points a gun into another's mouth. The pointee redirects the gun into another man's mouth, who is then shot. There seems to be a blast of glass shards, from a gun, I think. Most or all of the men die. <br/
