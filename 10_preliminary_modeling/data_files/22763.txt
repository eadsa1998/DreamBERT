My dream was confused. Perhaps there were two dreams. I arrived at a house and a group of friends were outside it. I went up and a very good friend of mine came out and she didn't even say hello to me. I was amazed because she looked sleepy. All of them came out of the rooms and a girl told me something and I thought they were "flying" and I was angry because it was a place where we were supposed to work as nurses. They came down the stairs and I had come with another group and we put smocks on and started to work. I don't remember any more. It was nighttime.
