I was at Midvale High School except it was the start of Year 10 and it looked completely different. There were millions of kids there (just for Year 10). They had a shop at the school, like a Target, and an electronics store that was open all day. I got bored and crawled down this hill, through a hole in the fence and earlier on, I went to the shop and I wanted this jumper. There were two big change rooms, a girl and boy one. I didn't wanna change but I went to go back behind a cabinet and I don't know why but they took my shirt off so I could try it on. Whitehall High School people were there and they were being evil. Also, Dad and I were at this shop buying pencils and we got these Monty Python things too. Later, I wanted to go back to the shop, but I couldn't until lunch or recess because they would wonder why I was there. Later, we had a freaky camera thing and we could fly and stuff and we went to this building to take pictures. There were freaky people around.
