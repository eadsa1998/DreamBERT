I am preparing to leave on my space ship but first I need to go to the bathroom. I find a room, I shut the door and curtains in the window. It won't shut completely. I lay down on a bench to shit in a diaper because I can't find a toilet. Just at that moment, a line of people peek into the window to say goodbye to me. I am embarrassed. Jerome says goodbye. Then the door opens and Mitch R comes in and sits on my belly and we kiss. I like him and enjoy the kiss but am uncomfortably aware of the shit in my diaper. I get up. Mitch leaves. I clean up and put on my space helmet. I try to lock the door. It won't lock. A man helps me. I try to turn on a radio to hear the countdown. Mitch says it's best to hear it from the PA system. We linger over goodbyes. It feels nice to be with him.
