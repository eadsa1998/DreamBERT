I was at a house which had a pool and my class was doing swimming. The house was spooky and in the walls were big scary rooms. I think there was a shop "attached" to the house. The room filled up with water and me and this lady had to run and close the door, but the door was going to open because of all the pressure. We ran into the store to a container of water and then the water came but was coming over in little waves. We ate M &amp; M's and there were gnomes. We opened a door and the water was gone.
