I dreamed that I was at home and I told my dad I wanted to join a sorority at school, but he didn't want me to. If I joined a sorority, he would take me out of school. So I went downtown on the bus and joined the Spars because I didn't want to go back to school without belonging to a sorority. Of course I did this out of spite, which my father didn't like, but I still had to go to the Spars because I had enlisted.
