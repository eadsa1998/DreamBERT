I was leaving Kmart.  We were looking for shoes for Littlest Pet Shop.  Hungry, we ordered pizza.  My mother handed me a small bottle of green liquid.  I wasn't going to get it, but then did because the man was looking at us.  It was supposed to be like $5 but on the checkout it was listed as $75.  We left and my mother was going to go into the grocery store.  She didn't want me to come, even though I really need to go shopping.  We were driving around in circles.  Finally I said stop!  I realized I didn't even know who was driving.  It was my father, and he was impatient.  Then, something about an accident.  Not from my father but our 'driver'.  Someone gave a testimony of being driven straight over in a little plane.
