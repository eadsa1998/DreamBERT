I was in a class of some sort.  Talked to my former friend Jenna and realized we were on speaking terms again and somehow gotten over whatever the problem was.  Class went on break I think, and I went off to the left aisle.  Can't remember much else, aside from making out- not sure if it was my boyfriend Jeremy or someone else.
