The dream was a brief one, but caused me a great deal of anxiety. I dreamed it was a Wednesday afternoon, and I was scheduled to attend two things at four o'clock: a water safety course and a sorority meeting. I decided, however, that I wanted to go home and did so. At six o'clock, however, I was horrified; I had failed to attend a water safety class upon which my summer job depended, and a sense of obligation told me I should have attended the meeting.
