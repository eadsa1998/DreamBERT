Scene apparently laid in hometown. Two girls (? sisters) travel about murdering people. This does not impress me as notably strange or outrageous, but more as we view severe wind or lightening storms -- beyond our power to control. I notice these 2 girls leaving a house that looks like our house in hometown, and I wonder if they have killed Faye. Jumping up on porch I walk into the house, which is strangely quiet. There is something sinister in the atmosphere. I call "hello" several times in a loud voice, but get no answer. I then push switch of the upstairs light and go up the stairway. Upstairs, there is a light burning in the bathroom but the one that should be light as I feel in danger. No reply from Faye.
