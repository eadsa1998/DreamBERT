I was at a party down at White's. We were in the buildings. We looked out the window and there was a commotion. A policeman was outside with George Gedeons' wife. She was complaining that George was neglecting his family, especially the small baby. Then I went outside and Bill Grove was walking down the street imitating different people and a lady with him did the repeat of his. I had a mug of water hanging by a string. Bill Grove spit into my mug. It seemed that the whole country was at a standstill in industry. There were only a few special aluminum jobs being done. Andy P. and a couple other guys were doing the special job. There were crowds of people assembled by White's Sewing Machine Company.
