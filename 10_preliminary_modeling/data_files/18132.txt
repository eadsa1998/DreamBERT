I was in a large auditorium. There was a woman and a little boy or little girl on the stage. They were some sort of religious leaders, like revivalists or something. This woman also had a following of strange people and little children, an old woman, and an old farm laborer who came in later and joined them, who went around through the audience selling strange things. The woman apparently was preaching something about the virtues of sex, because on both sides of me these people sitting in the seats were having or were attempting to have intercourse, including these two men that were seated to my right. This dream was influenced by a set of characters in the Glass Harp by Truman Capote which I was reading last night.
