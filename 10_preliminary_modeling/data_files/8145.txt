I was on the TV show Joe Millionaire. Early on I mentally took myself out of the competition because I recognized that I was just so different than all the other woman. Once I did that, the dynamics between myself and Evan changed dramatically. We became buddies, I suppose. I think I also just told him that I was mentally taking myself out of the competition and why. I think I became for him the person that he could trust and confide in. We started spending alot of time together. Primarily just when he needed someone to talk to. I was that person.
