 I walk into a geography class the first day of spring semester at Brimson. I'm on the 2nd floor of Social Science Hall, in room number ___ D ( I forget). My coworker Carol Flanders and a man are there. On the dry erase board is written the words "small class". The room is large and has a computer for each student. The room becomes crowded with students. I sit down at a Macintosh computer. The teacher is a nutty man. He goes over the assignments, writing on the board what the class will do. He asks students if they would prefer the final to be a Friday or a Monday. He comes up to me and asks what I prefer. I say I prefer the choices on the left half of the board, which include Friday and Monday. We need a partner for the assignments. I'm one of the last people to get a partner, who is a woman named Katie. She has dark skin and hair, a little bit of acne, and slurred speech. No one else wants to be my partner. My classmate Beth Monder asks me a question. I think she would be my partner, but then she isn't. I am sitting at the front of the room next to a woman. The teacher has us ride our bicycles down a sidewalk and turn around, riding back. We swerve at his directions. There is a stone wall with some astrology information carved into it for each astrological sign. I see my sister Heather or someone who looks like her. There are some papers and assignments listed on the board. We have to do a "nickel talk", which is a short talk, and a "one talk", which is a longer talk.
