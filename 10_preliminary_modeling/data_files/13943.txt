I was at school in the library. Indians were in there praying. This guy came in and threatened to let off a bomb. I left. I was in a shop, when the bomb went off. Darren had this electronic map game thing. This president guy made me make the decision to do something about the guy. Someone offered me coffee and I said that I didn't like coffee.
