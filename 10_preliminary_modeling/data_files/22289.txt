I dreamed about a girl (at this point I am in love with a girl; perhaps this influenced it). I searched for her among people and things and many objects that separated us. Even though I came close to her, I could never reach her. The girl in my dream was the one I like. I heard laughter, babies crying, noises made by things. I tried to pass them by so that they would disappear, but they came out more strongly. I walked, I ran, I felt tired, almost dead, but I wanted to go on, to get to where she was, but I didn't get there. I could only see her face, which was looking at me, which was moving, signaling me to go on, that I would reach her, but I didn't. It ended when I awoke.
