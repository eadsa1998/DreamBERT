I was at 'home'. This girl was there and she was being a cow. These people I was with were shouting back. She said something and I said "That was mean". This teacher told us off, especially me. I said that I didn't say anything. She said that my voice was the only one she could hear. I was like "What the hell?!". She said that I'd have to face that girl first period tomorrow. I thought that I had English first but she said "Social studies".
