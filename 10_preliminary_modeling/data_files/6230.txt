Last night I dreamed that I went on a trip to Florida with my friends. It was actually a memory of when I did go there for a week. I dreamed of all the parties we went to, laying on the beach, and all of the other good times we had. I remembered how we had a party in our room and our phone got stolen. I also recalled all the people we met on the trip.
