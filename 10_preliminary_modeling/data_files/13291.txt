I was at a shop at a photo place near a pool table with the songs I'd done in 2003. These black guys were joking around and asked if I was one of "those people who play Mp3's nearby people to look cool?". There was a photo of our family at the photo place and I was in nappies, but Ezra wasn't. Later, Weird Al Yankovic and I were talking. David Cross was there and he lifted up his shirt. Weird Al asked if we liked 'green'. I wanted to change my background on the computer back to Arrested Development. There was a sleep lab and I told Mom I wanted to work with one. Samantha and Payton were in there. Later, she and Seamus were in the boot of a car having sex. Samantha became interested in Dad. I was at home and there was some chicken there and no-one had told me that food was ready.
