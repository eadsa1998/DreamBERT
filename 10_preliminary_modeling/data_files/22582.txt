The places I saw in my dream that were familiar were two: the university's yard and the bathroom. The characters were my best girlfriend and a  girl who is not a friend of mine who was with a lady who must have been her mother. The latter lady is the mother of a class acquaintance of mine. We were all in the bathroom when an elderly gentleman came in and I left the bathroom and was talking to some friends.Then the girl's mother came out saying that the girl had killed the gentleman and her father (? he had not been in the bathroom). The girl was moved to an office because she was weeping bitterly and saying that she wanted to kill everybody. It was then that she saw me passing outside the room and she told me a series of threats. She was furious with me and I, afraid that she might kill me, left the university running.
