I can't remember it properly, but there was a zombie infection thing. You could get rid of the infection. Some people I knew got infected and I killed the 'main zombie'. Someone said "Charlie". The infected person was wearing yellow and had holes in them and they were blind. But then it was just a suit and they took it off and they were normal. We went into this room. This guy had had a heart transplant and the heart was from a pig? He turned into a zombie later and I stabbed him in the chest hard. I was then in bed, sharing with Ezra. He poked me from behind and I turned around and he was a zombie and I stabbed through the blanket. I chopped this zombie guy's head off and his mouth and throat were full of rice. Mom came and saw it and left. She came back and said "Why did you do this?" and everyone was back to normal and I was confused. We left and I was in my car and I had my P's. As I drove further away (I was coming from Mom's old house), there was lots of smoke and light posts down, house alarms going off, people crying etc.
