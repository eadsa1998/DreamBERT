 I'm at my high school friend Binky Ahmed's house. There is a sign in a tree, along with many wooden sticks that are bundled up. I carry a vacuum and extension cord up a long wooden staircase to his house. He is going to visit his roommate/friend down south. I think I am invited, but I don't want to go, even if that is the case.
