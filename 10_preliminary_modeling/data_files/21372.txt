I was at a party and each one of us had a board with old coins pasted on it. I took off some old coins and was going to replace them with my new ones. There was a dime 1849 and there were a lot of Indian head pennies. I was climbing over a high fence and the fence broke. So I ran away, not to be blamed for doing it. I was looking thru a window and the building was high. I was hanging between two walls, hiding from my pursuer. He finally saw my hat above the wall and thought he would get me, but I got away. A fellow came around and said, "Who took the old coins?" I said, "I did. I didn't think you wanted the old ones." So I returned the old coins on the board.
