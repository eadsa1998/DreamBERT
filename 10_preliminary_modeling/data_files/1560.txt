I am an important person, maybe a princess. I am in a wheelchair and go out for a walk. I am surrounded by reporters and gawkers that crowd around me and get in my way. They are shouting questions. I am aloof and angry. I intimidate them. They want to rush forward and help me, but I stare at them and they don't dare. We go to a store. I look in a window and see food. I choose an apple and an apple juice. Then I notice I've chosen both of the same kind. I go inside to pay. One reporter is nice and sympathetic. I notice him. As I leave the store, there are 2 or 3 stairs. The crowd is wild and wants to help. I snap my chair around and yell, "If you don't get out of the way, I'll twirl around and you'll get hurt. This is a warning." I then twirl around and go down the stairs backwards. I go on down the street. I see a big beautiful old house, cream-colored with huge, sturdy and ornately carved beams and columns. It is now divided into apartments, but it once was an elegant home. The nice man says, "It is beautiful. Do you like it?" I breathe, "Oh yes." I try to look in the windows. He says, "How would you like the windows?" I say, "Big and airy, but in the back. I like the smaller ones in the front." He nods. I see inside, fireplaces, pools and lovely fountains and tile work. A woman sits by a big window. I go on down the street. I see two women. They are old friends of the man. I am holding a baby. I say to the woman, "Here. Hold the baby and pat it and kiss it like I've seen you do. The baby needs it." She takes the baby, but they are too rough and uncaring. I ask for the baby back. I say, "If you can't do it right, then I'll do it." I kiss and caress the baby softly. The man is tender as he looks on. I like him and feel feelings of friendship and camaraderie. My father comes over and explains how people become royalty. They all started out as regular people and then are knighted. My father tells the man to go with him and he will knight him.
