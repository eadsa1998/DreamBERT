I am attending a math class, college math or something. I am attracted to the math teacher and I'm also angry at him. He is flippant and puts me way far away from the regular classroom students who are younger than me. Or else I choose to sit far down the hall, maybe a combination. I decide to leave and I gather up papers and decide to take with me photos of him even as I am telling him I don't like him. I pile them all up and know that as soon as I try to leave, the papers will all fall and make a mess. So in playful defiance of him, I go to his cupboard and take out three rubber bands. He mocks shock that I knew where they were and that I'd have the audacity to take them. We are flirting even though we are pretending to dislike each other.
