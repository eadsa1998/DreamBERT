 I'm in a play that is about to take place or has just taken place. I'm in a store-like area. I pick out three pairs of pants to buy. They are all size 32x34, but are different colors. A woman tells me the pants are normally $59. I get a 50% discount because I'm in the play. I think that I need to get some new pants anyway. I'm in a Pizza Hut after the play. My mom and the family are there. My sister Heather may be sitting all by herself. We move to a large table.
