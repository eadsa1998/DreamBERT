 I'm in the Big Resort Area working near a lake. There is a dock there. A woman comes up to me. She needs a hedge clipper. Mike Hollow and Phoebe Mills are gone to town for the day. The sheds are locked up so I can't get the woman what she needs. It's later, Mike and Phoebe arrive back. Mike says that after their baby went to bed at 9am they got some rest. We may be the woman her tool. I'm down on the dock with my friends Jerry Parsons and Tom Olson. It's an overcast, chilly day. Jerry looks cold. I ask him if he wants a shirt. He says yes. I then realize I don't have any extra shirts, and I tell him I'll give him mine when I get done with work. There is a 44-foot whit boat, which Tom, and then Jerry, get in. There is a smaller 12-foot boat with a motor. Mike pulls the smaller boat up on the left side of the dock. He runs the motor to get the fishing line out of it. The motor spits out a long thin strand of line. When it's done, I pick the line up. The curling, slinky-like strand of line is apple peel. There is a stereo on the dock, tilted. I sit and look at tapes there: Led Zeppelin and others.
