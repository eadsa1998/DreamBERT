 I'm outside my house on a skateboard. Some guys from Brimson go by in a car. A man pulls up in a car that looks like my friend Tiny Combs' old car. He gets out and looks at the boulevard. I'm waiting for a flight to Germany. We're leaving the house at 7:00. It is 6:30. My mom leaves. She is buying me some new underwear. My teammate Larry Rollie comes to my house to go to Confirmation class with my sister Heather, if they have it. He walks into the kitchen as I am putting on my white briefs underwear over my pants. I am then wearing overall that have bell-bottoms and bleached spots on them. We eat tortilla chips. There is a newspaper there. In it, I am getting some sort of an award, and there is a plane crash. On the sports page, there is photograph of a small, round battery: the kind that is the size of a button. I wait for a flight ticket. My friend Hilary Nano called 15 minutes ago. I know either my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas or my friend Nicole Peterson has contacted me with a negative response. I kind of want her to call.
