I dreamed that I was coming out of the upstairs bathroom in my parents house and as I was standing out in the hallway, listening, I heard the TV blaring, and it was a news magazine like 20/20 and the topic was Job Searching. I groaned inwardly and thought 'oh great, here we go again' because now my parents were going to bring up the whole issue of finding a job. And I don't want to discuss it.
