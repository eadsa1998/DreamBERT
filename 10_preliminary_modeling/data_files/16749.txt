There are two female guinea pig salesmen in my kitchen. One of them has red hair. There are many guinea pigs, around the kitchen, one of them was almost as big as my cat. He comes over to my cat Bigfoot, who just says, "Hey!" as if to mean, "Get away from me!" I thought it was funny, but not unusual, that BigGuy would decide to use an English phrase.
