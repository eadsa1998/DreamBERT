I was going to a carnival for students who were graduating from Westport College, and it was outside kind of like at a park or something. And I was there at the gate wanting to get in. And they said you had to show the same credit card that you used to pay tuition and stuff. And I showed it to them and they said it wasn't the thing that she said, and the main said, "Well, just go on in." So I went in and I was walking around. I think I was by myself. I don't remember too much about what I saw around the place, but I do remember one of the features was a carousel and there weren't many people getting on it. And because there weren't many people getting on it, it wasn't really _______. And he just got on a horse, and I think he did something -- I don't know what -- he did something to just start the whole thing. And he'd be riding on this horse and there were controls to make the carousel music louder and softer, and I remember that once I got on, some other people got on, and the horses were kind of ugly compared to usual carousel horses. They were plastic and they _______ formed and they weren't very colorful; they were just blah. And then I woke up.
