There was some weird stuff going on. I found an online room for DopeWars but it was then like real life. There were rows of tables and people were on each side and there were cards with random pictures. There was a pile of cards and post-its. I decided to play again but I couldn't remember what to do in the real life version. I was then at the old house and I found an old photo. I had a half sister called Loanne. Ezra called her and said "it's Tommy". She told him she thought we were dead and it had been 11 years since we last saw her. Dad and Ezra were crying. Then Ezra, some other guy and I weighed ourselves. Ezra weighed less than me. Dad said I weighed 86kg and said no-one seemed to be going down and I said "I've lost 11kg!". Then Nana and Poppa were meeting Loanne and some evil people out the back. She was magical? This girl said they had spells and were going to do bad stuff. Alyssa was nearby, and I said something about her fat but not being able to get through the door and she heard and got angry. I apologized and she got over it after a few minutes. The stereo was on and Pour Some Sugar on Me came on. I turned it off to call Nana and then there was a loud noise and they were here. Then Nana and Poppa were inside. The radio was now on 92.9 and the floor opened up and they fell in.
