My "sister" and I are told to clean up the outside deck, which is quite large, like a dock area on a lake. It is next to a large body of water. So I have a broom and my area is around the lake edge, but I am haphazardly doing it, missing places and slowing down. My sister is working hard. I realize that I have left great clumps of dirt and lots of little dust, so I go back, realizing "better late than never" and try to clean it all up. We finally get it all done. I see a stairway down to a cabin where "Barb, or Pricilla or Cinderella" lives. She's a nice lady. We go to say hi. She gives me a haircut. We come back up to the dock area, hanging up the broom, and now the dock is covered almost knee deep in water. It's a bit difficult to see where to step, so we are careful and a little nervous. I didn't remember so much water before. Grandfather calls from the cabin and he doesn't approve of my haircut. I hand him a note from the lady saying he probably won't like it, but she hopes he forgives her and can see how nice it is. A small note from Maggie (disabled) is handwritten in blue ink. She says she's doing fine and is still going to school at M&amp;A (Math and Arts). I know that means she's taking one class in math. "Big deal," I think.
