At a strange place: when refugee children are presented to those who might want to adopt them. I go there with Father Andrew: we were at his house first, eating breakfast with Marissa. I see a little boy (looked like Jolie Berg), who comes to me, sits in my lap, and talks about his likes and how much he would like to be with us. Very affectionate. But I can't take him with me. See Frank and walk away with him.
