My parents and I were exploring a sort of large white globe structure.  There were cavities in it but we didn't explore those.  It was a strange place.  There were a bunch of overweight 'country bumpkins' standing on a set of bleachers, modeling some nice clothes.  They looked silly in the nice clothes because their faces/hair/speech gave them away, but they stood there smiling nonetheless.  They wanted something from us but we weren't about to give it to them.  We ignored them and passed on by.  Then I stood looking up toward my father, who was standing somewhat above me, as if he were my king.  I spoke to him jokingly role-playing the 'uneducated hick', speaking poorly.  I had to go back from where we'd come to get something.  I passed the modelers again and when I arrived back at the spot, my old best friend Candy was there. She was a queen, and I treated her as such, not as a person who had once been my best friend.   I spoke to her briefly and I think I gave her something.  I vaguely remember talking to someone about my music-taste synesthesia.
