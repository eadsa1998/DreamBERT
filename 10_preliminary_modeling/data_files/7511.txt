Mary and I are embracing. She is undergoing treatment for the illness and I suddenly notice that she is bald. I am surprised because she is not being given chemotherapy. When I call attention to her baldness and express surprise that she has lost her hair, we both cry and hug each other. Mary says, "This must be hard on you, Ed." She recognizes the pressures under which I am living. I cannot believe that with all of her suffering, she is concerned about me and my feelings. This is so much like Mary -- to put aside her own pain and suffering and to think of others. Her concern for me -- when she has a life-threatening disease -- just broke me up. I dissolved in tears.
