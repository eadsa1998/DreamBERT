There is a really cute guy in one of my classes this semester. I dreamt that, after one of my classes on Tuesday, I had a couple of hours off before my 2:30 class. I was on my way to the Sawyer building when I saw the cute guy coming out of the Sawyer building. He was on his way to a shopping center which in my dream was at the bottom of Beacon Hill. Since I had nothing to do I decided to follow him. I couldn't believe what I was doing, but I really liked him. He walked into the store and I followed him. I pretended that I was shopping and that I didn't even know that he was there. When I went around an aisle I more or less bumped into him. I acted like I was surprised to see him. We talked a little. It was a bit awkward because we don't know each other that much. We were both pretty much done with shopping and we more or less walked over to the counter together. When we got out of the store it was just about 2:30, so we walked to class together. I [illegible] went to class. When it was over we got on the [illegible] to go for a drink. Of course I said, "Yes." Then my alarm clock went off and woke me up.
