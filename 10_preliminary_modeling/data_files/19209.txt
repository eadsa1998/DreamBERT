There are people around the table, mostly men and the woman and on top of the table there's a glass bubble gum machine, round, and this bubble gum machine is receiving the attention of a child. It is supposed to civilize the child. I don't know how I learned this in the dream, but anyway I learned that this bubble gum machine was a child. And after this the scene showed the bubble gum machine had become mine. I was being congratulated. I was proud, and I was inquiring to someone how one went about getting the little balls out of the glass jar so that they could play with them. This had something to do with my pondering the idea of how does one reach the child if one can't take its thoughts or something out and play with them or something like this. This is what provoked the sudden lecture from someone in the audience on the theory of principles of objectivism. That's the whole of it.
