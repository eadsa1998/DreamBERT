I had a temp assignment at ITI, in a department I've not worked in before. All of the desks in this department were in one big open room, set up in rows, with every two desks being set up to face each other. They were also not divided by cubicles. They placed me at a desk facing a woman that was my age or slightly older. She had very blonde hair and wore it the way my aunts were their hair, maybe causing her to give the impression that she is older than she might really be. There was a man at the desk behind her that was slightly older still, with silver-grey hair. He was a large man, not obese, but large. They were both friendly, greeted me, and asked me something. I laughed and told them that I am a permanent temp. I explained that I had been doing temp assignments there since November of last year, with seldom more than a week or two off in-between assignments. They just hadn't seen me there before, because of where their department was located. I was waiting for Jo R to bring me instructions for my assignment. [But Jo was not over this department in waking life.] There was no computer at my desk so I realized I would not be doing any computer work this time. I think she had finally brought me one thing to do and I had finished and was now sitting there waiting for her to bring me the next thing. It was nearly closing time. I got involved in something. When I looked at my watch it was nearly 7:30 p.m. I couldn't believe it. The other two people were still there. I said something about not realizing how late it had gotten and quickly cleaned up my desk and left. When I came in the next day, no one was there yet. I went to get the things I was working on and went back to my desk, after I started laying things out I realized that I was at the wrong desk. I needed to move over four rows. I quickly gathered up my things so I could get moved before anyone came in and saw me at the wrong desk.
