We live in a large house and Frank is trying to fix things but uses only rubber bands and does not do it correctly; I get angry at him. "You always have to do it your own way - differently." I prepare some soup with dumplings but kids don't want to eat it; I get angry and am impatient. But then I hug the kids and tell them I love them.
