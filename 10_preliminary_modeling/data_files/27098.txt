Two girls and myself drove out of the city on a road on either side of which were beautiful wooded areas. We were going to a gas station to get the owner's advertisement to be put in the M--- annual. We by-passed the gas station and pulled into a private drive in order to turn around. The  girl driving kept on the drive until we came to the house. (She thought it would be easier to turn around.) We stopped by the house which was located in a wooded area. The other girl (not driving) and myself got out and walked into the woods. Suddenly a big handsome man (about 40 yrs. old), presumably the owner of the house, appeared. He asked us what we were doing and we told him. Then he began telling us how someone had come into his woods and scared his pet frog. The frightened frog jumped into a small stream where he got caught on a jagged rock which slit his throat. The man moaned that the frog had died and would no longer warn the man at night if the woods were to catch on fire...
