I dreamt that I walked past a house quite close to my house that I'm moving out off. It was a cute little house with flowers in pots outside. There was a wooden deck and it all faced the ocean. It was perfect and the cost to rent was $400 per month. The feelings I had were those of tremendous disappointment and sorrow for I have just put down first and last month rent as well as a deposit on another apartment. Of course I couldn't get out of that so the feeling was major disappointment. I recall the sun was shining. It was a perfect day in my favorite neighborhood.
