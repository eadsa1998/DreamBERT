Cousin Terence has a newborn baby girl. I hold her. She's very beautiful and well-formed. She's also very intelligent and talks. I think it's quite remarkable that I can be privy to how a newborn thinks and feels. I hold her and we talk. My "sister" and "cousin" Darcy talk about when they were born. I try to remember their birthdays. Darcy's is XXX 3rd or so and my "sister's" is XXX the 15th. My "sister" explains that they were born with nearly half a brain. If you are born with just half a brain, you die. I see what looks like a water melon being chopped in half by a huge knife; however, they have a little more than half a brain. I am drawn to Terence's baby girl. I wrap her in a pretty blanket I knitted. I'm explaining things to her.
