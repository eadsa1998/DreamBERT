Nate is back. He calls me Bridgette and is trying to make himself useful so he can hang out with us. He sort of ignores me. I feel a longing to hug and kiss him, but he's too busy moving things around. It's kind of a refection of me, especially when he deliberately calls me Bridgette. I say, "It would help if you called me by the right name." I know he's pretending he's mixing me up with another of his women. Another woman called Sonja tells him to straighten up the books. I see a shelf of very large "oversized" books. It's Howard's and my collection. Nice books: Art, Cosmos, etc. Then she tells him to go find out the name of this crip talking rock she hands him. "That's too hard," I say. He leaves the room in search, looking at me like "Oh, yeah? Too hard, huh? You'll see. I can do it." He comes back in with an opened book on rocks. He's holding the rock up to a picture and they are identical. He calls it a long Latin-like name. I am surprised he could find it. He then takes off his shirt, maybe to get down to work. I notice he's gained some weight and it looks good on him. I want to go hug him and cuddle, but he moves on. He's now straightening up the magazines on the coffee table. One is Life Magazine and the front cover picture looks alive. It's an astronaut that had the front part of his skull removed and electrodes put on his brain, raw and red, so he can be monitored as he's out in space. It's gruesome looking.
