I was in a large darkened room and was in the process of dressing. On the bed there were civilian clothes and a Navy uniform. It seemed that I could not find the ones that I wanted which was complicated in that I didn't seem to really know what I wanted. Once I lighted a light but just for a brief flash because there were no shades on the windows. While the light flashed I noticed the uniform especially.
