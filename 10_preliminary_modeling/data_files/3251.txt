I am writing a play for television and the woman actor says, "How come the beginning characters were not so good?" I point out that writing takes time to improve and evolve. The beginning of a series is not as finely tuned as later. She does a beginning scene which has since been changed and improved. I wince at its badness. Now a young man has a crush on me and follows me around. I am embarrassed. I am teaching a writing course and it is unethical for me to return any personal feelings to him. I am putting my long hair up on rollers. He watches and pleads with me to notice him. I try to ignore him, but it is hard. Then I notice another student, a new one, and feel embarrassed I had not paid attention to him before. I am worried he will have lost interest and pull away from the class. Then I would have done a bad job as a teacher. I talk with him, trying to assure him this isn't the way I usually teach class, but I got sidetracked. I have four or five curlers in and realize I have to take them out now and wonder if it was even worth the trouble putting them in because they need time to set the curl.
