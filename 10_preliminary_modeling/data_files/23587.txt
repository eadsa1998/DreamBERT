I'm in church; somewhat of a cathedral and part theater. I sit down in the pew in the balcony. There are people from high school and teachers. People start talking to me. Somebody threw a wet wad of toilet paper at me. More people start doing the same thing. From all sides, people are saying things, asking me why I'm there, telling me that I shouldn't be there. Everyone is right in my face, surrounding me.
