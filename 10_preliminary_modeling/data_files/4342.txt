["Finances lost."] I'm working in an office. My job is to keep track of the money bag and finances. I have lost both the money bag and a financial calculator (which looks just like my TV remote control.). I am searching my desk and the shelves above it. Everything is a mess. Food had been left out and small bugs are all over the place. I find other things that look like the calculator, but it's not the special financial one. Finally I find it. I am so happy and relieved. Then the secretary whose desk I usually put the money bag finds that. I am glad that wasn't my mistake.
