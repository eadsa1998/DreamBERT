Now the actor Richard Gere behaves like Jim Carrey. Making outrageous jokes. He is funny and annoying at the same time. Cute but pushy. He wants to watch a video with me. He chooses one called "The Thing" I say oh no. Is this that really scary one? We start watching. It's a horror story, but I realize I'd seen it before. A woman with arthritis. No so scary after all, just an OK story. I get bored and go upstairs. I see Ellie lying in a child'' bed trying to sleep. As I am walking up the stairs, I see a man and woman getting ready to be married. They wear fancy clothes that are red silk and silver sequins. Matching shoes. She can't get her shoes to fit right and stay on. He ridicules her as they bicker up the stairs. I point out a steep hill that represents Ginny and Ernie's relationship. A strong together relationship. Now I am back in the room with Richard Gere and Ellie and a small child, a girl, and Ginny. I am helping the girl do some task. Richard keeps interrupting with Jim Carrey tricks. I say jokingly who let this guy in anyway. I realize it was me that invited him in. A friend of Sparkey's.
