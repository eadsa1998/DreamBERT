I see Mary on her back lying across 2 or 3 dining room chairs, dressed in a bathing suit. The dining room is in the home of my parents (where we used to live, when I was a child). I am on my way out of the house, and as I am walking through the hall going toward the door and passing the dining room, I glance inside and see Mary. She is lying on those chairs (whose backs are against the wall and just under the window) which are on the far side of the dining room table. I come around and talk to her. I think I said that I can't sleep and she also said she can't sleep. It is when she began talking that I noticed her. I come around to her side of the table, drop on my knees in order to see her better, and talk to her. She says something funny, and I reply, "Oh, you're so adorable." Earlier in the dream, and before I see Mary, I am bothered by a long, jagged toenail on the big toe of one of my feet. I look for, and find, a place where I could cut that toenail, and did so. It took 2 cuts to shorten the toenail. It feels so much better after I do this.
