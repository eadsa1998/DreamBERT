Dreamt about the ocean. I had a wetsuit and wanted to learn to surf. I was watching some surfers. But then I didn't have a surfboard. I was thinking about boogie boarding and also fearing sharks. The tide was coming in and it was dangerous because at the edge of the water there was a tall sand embankment with rocks on top -- so nowhere to land if you surfed into shore. There were some big waves.
