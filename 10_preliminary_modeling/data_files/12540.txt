I was at a place with Mom and Ezra. I was shooting Ezra? I ran off. I ended up at this pretty garden place and was hiding behind a tree. There was a thing on the wall, covered in flowers. I walked out from behind the tree and I was then at Nana's. When I was walking back, Dmitri and someone were playing chess next to the pond, which was all different. I went back to the garden place and Darren had biscuits.
