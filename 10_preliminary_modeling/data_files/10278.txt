Father Andrew at a makeshift Church -- we all just stand around; there are bare tables with crumbs on cardboard plates; finally someone brings out some sweet cakes like at Bible study and we come up and take a piece of cake which is supposed to be like Communion... (reminded of Scripture of the Canaanite woman who is satisfied with the crumbs that fall from the master's table)
