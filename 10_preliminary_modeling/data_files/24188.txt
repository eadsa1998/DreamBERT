I was living in a studio apartment but there was no carpet and one side of the room was filled with old furniture stacked up. There was a dusty fireplace and I started cleaning it out. Then I opened one of the doors and I was in someone else's house. It was a huge mansion. Outside was a swimming pool. The people who lived in the house saw me and I told them I was sorry I must be sleepwalking. Then I went back into my room and there was a white cat. I didn't want to throw the cat out but I wasn't allowed to have pets. I started calling all these people trying to find a home for the cat.
