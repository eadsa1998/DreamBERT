I was at university in the carpark. I pulled up next to a car to wait for Dad. Eugene's car was next to me. We were then all standing around together and he was really tall and older looking. We then became friends. Then it was like the comic Crossed. I was with some others including Rover. We were at a shop. The Crossed attacked us and we ran. The cross looked like swastika from the side. We were then outside a little building. One of us got Crossed and attacked another one. Rover also got Crossed so I killed him. This guy grabbed a girl and fell to the ground. He was Crossed but he grabbed a pole and stabbed himself and then he was okay. We realised that we could change back and I was upset about Rover. To change back they had to do a good deed.
