I was happy with Ida. It had been a long time since we had seen each other, but it seemed that nothing had occurred, and at times it wasn't her, but Emma that I saw. We were talking very gaily and inside I was asking myself if we had really been apart. And I rejoiced at being together again, that nobody had had enough influence to keep us apart. I think we were inside a house, with plenty of light.
