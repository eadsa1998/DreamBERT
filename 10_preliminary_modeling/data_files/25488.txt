 I'm at a bait shop with my dad. My friend Binky Ahmed is working there. I buy 15 ounces of night crawlers for $1.56. The other option was to buy a dozen for $2.22. My dad buys some minnows. Binky has a huge live fishing his hands with a bite taken out of its tail and a few scales missing. I am in water. Our boat is near. I want to get back in the boat. When I try to get back in, the boat capsizes. There are straps lengthwise and crosswise on the boat. My brother Wally is there and helps counterbalance the boat so I can get in. My dad, and sisters Heather and Ramona are there too.
