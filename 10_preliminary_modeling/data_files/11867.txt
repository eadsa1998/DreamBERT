I was at some snowy place with a guy I made up called Jake Stevens. He fell into this hole and we didn't know where he was but I remembered seeing this hole and I found him. I drove the car into a wall? Dad was driving with Ezra, Jake, Jayson and I in a car going 25kmh and the police started chasing us. We kept going into taxis (we went into two) and kept eating cake. There was a strange ride in a shop thing, and there was a lentil restaurant across from it. Dad and I said "Just once I'd like to keep the lentils off the floor" and then he said "I should have done that hey, hey, hey thing".
