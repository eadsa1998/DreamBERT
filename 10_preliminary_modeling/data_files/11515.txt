In this dream my wife and I were living in a house on top of a high hill. There was a steep winding stairway descending from our house to the bottom of the hill. I would say the height of the hill was about 300 feet. I was attending some college and my mother, brother, and two friends came to visit us. They stayed for a short time, and during that time I was trying to find a baseball game on the radio, but I couldn't. It seems to me that we got into an argument over something and they decided to leave. The last thing I can remember is helping my mother down the long steep, winding stairs.
