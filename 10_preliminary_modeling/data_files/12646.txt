I was at school and it was Year 11. Calvin and I were late for class. The teacher was called Ms Cole. The floor was noisy. I 'ran' to a chair and the teacher yelled at me for being rude. I ended up sitting on the floor. I realized it was woodwork. Calvin and I went next door to accounting. Calvin got a letter from Ms Cole to let him do accounting instead. I needed to ask her, but I thought she was going to say no, but she let me. I had three pairs of shoes. In accounting I had to sit next to Harlan. Samantha poked her tongue out at me. There were lots of people in the class. Later, we were watching something and I asked Samantha if she watched Heroes. She said "Yeah, I just love Peter and want to take him home!" and I started laughing thinking, 'Yeah, so do I'. There was a guy in some thing. People were getting killed and swapping.
