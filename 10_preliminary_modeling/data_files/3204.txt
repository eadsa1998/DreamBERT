I am a young woman who lives in a huge family. It is so big there are no places in the house where you can be alone. The couch is overrun with squabbling siblings of all ages. I want to go to the bathroom and must rush in and try to lock the doors before I'm interrupted by other siblings. This is driving me crazy. Finally I can't take it any more and I decide to run away from home. I hit out at some of the fighting kids on the couch as I pass them as I head for the front door. I get on my bike and go. Now I'm on a road, gravely, and following a huge truck. Now we are in a tunnel and it is dark and fearsome. I hope I don't get killed. I make it through to the other side. It's a town. I have the feeling the time period of this dream is older and maybe in Ireland. I want to find a place to live, an apartment, but of course I have no money. The shops are like in an indoor mall. I go to the bad part of town and see a carnival-like thing and wonder if I'll resort to taking a degrading job just to earn money for survival. But I pass the temptation of being a come-on girl for a booth and go to a counter where they do movies and ask the girl/woman there if they have any jobs. She laughs and says, "This is a very specialized job." I don't have the skills or training. I say, "I know," and ask her again if I can have a job.
