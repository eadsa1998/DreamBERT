Mary Matias told me a fellow played some hot ones today. She said one was a cherry. I said cherry path and she said yes, that was it. I was going to run for mayor or governor. I was going to vote. I got a cellophane and was to put my voting sheets in the bag. I looked for a seat to sit and I finally spotted one rocking chair in the corner. I sat into it. John Chipka came over to vote. I told the fellow, "I know him, he's a friend." "I will give you a bookie," said the man. I said ok. I was riding over tracks. I saw so many tracks, I drove down a dirt road.
