[1997-07-08] I was holding a waste basket and I was picking up trash from the front porch and front lawn. Pieces of rolled up newspaper, paper I was putting it into this basket and from this basket I poured it into a cardboard carton because it was trash day, the barrels were out by the curb and I was going to put this box and all into the barrel. But then I realized that the trash truck was already there and because of our method of pick-up which involves the hydraulic arms where they pick up the whole barrel and dump it into the truck, I was concerned that it would be unsafe for me to go over there and drop this box into the barrel. Then I heard someone outside of the truck who let me know that it would be perfectly safe to do it and I did.
