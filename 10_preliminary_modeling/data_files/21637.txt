I saw Love as winner. I looked into a book or magazine and I saw Kirk, Kick, or Kiek. I am not sure it was a hot tip. We were cleaning the basement ceiling. I got a broom and was brushing off cobwebs and I ran into ticks. They came down on me and did they bite me. Later I looked at Carter's shirt on him and he had bumps all over his back and chest from tick bites. I got one bite just then, so I said, "I'll fix this one. " I lit a match and put it on the tick. It stopped biting and it started to come out a little, then seemed to die and it was like a sliver protruding out of a swelling on my hand. There was a beehive on a wall next door. They wanted to get rid of it. I said, "Get hot water thru your hose and sprinkle it." I covered myself with a screen. I took no chances on being stung by bees. I got some hot tips from a couple of men, but can't recall the names now. I was repeating 802. There was a man painting on a bridge and he always made an 0 with his brush when he finished painting. I was going to school. I was walking on Superior Ave. and I heard Millie's voice in singing. It was above all the others. She was going to school classes. Our bathtub was overflowing. It was blocked, running over the floor. The sink was also overflowing.
