 I am with my dad, sisters Heather and Ramona, and brother Wally. My dad got a new stereo, and now Wally has the old one. Ramona may be associated with a light bulb breaking. Heather answers the phone. Music is playing. Everyone is getting very uptight: anxious and upset, claustrophobic because we're all in close proximity. I say I really think we all need some time to ourselves.
