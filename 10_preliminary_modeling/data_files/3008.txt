Another woman and myself are standing up beside a seated man. I hold a paper and the two of us are reciting a long list of rhyming things with lots of numbers on them to the man. The woman on my right knows them by heart and I sort of know them but mumble along, looking at the paper often. One line is that some people did not believe us that they thought we had sold them a bill of goods with the Tenemen square, one long yard (the whole nine yards). We looked at the word Tenemen to double check. Yes, it was the right word.
