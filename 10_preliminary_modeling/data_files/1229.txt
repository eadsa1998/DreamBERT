Ellie and I are walking down a hall, turn the corner and surprise my parents in lovemaking. I am embarrassed. We tip toe away. Later, I see my mother somewhere else and realize that my father was making love to someone else! Later, I'm driving a cart-like thing around the house. I turn right at the living room. Even though it's a house, there are streets and alleys. The snows have melted and the whole house is wet and drippy. I think, "Hey, now that the snows are melted, I can do a big cleaning and put up pretty curtains." As I drive the cart, my father reminds me that to go down Royal Ave. is better. I turn the cart around and say, "You're right." We drive on.
