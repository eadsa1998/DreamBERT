 I'm at Armstrong High School in the office signing my name on the in/out sheet. I realize I shouldn't be here. I don't go to school here, and don't belong here. My brother Wally got apprehended for something he did at Armstrong, and was shipped to Canada, where there is a "cold north wind". I joke, "Those Hansons, up to no good!" The head bouncer Ted Berry laughs because he remembers the incident where I let mice go in school. I laugh, and other women laugh too. My classmate from Brimson Holly Lapson is at the office getting a pass. She gives the excuse that none of her teachers could sign her absence slip. I know her excuse is bullshit. I go into the library. My high school classmate Mariah Beck and my coworkers from Fishing Haven Heather and Rachel are there. They talk with me about eating a lot of cold cereal: a box of Life cereal that is on the staff refrigerator in the commons. I tell them I'll eat some of it later. Other people from Fishing Haven, including my friend Jasper, are playing cards. One person wants to play Hearts, while another wants to quit. I pull up a big black chair, like the ones at Carter School, and join the group.
