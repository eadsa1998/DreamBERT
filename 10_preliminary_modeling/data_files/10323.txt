I am running downhill on dry grass on a very STEEP grade; WaLLY is along and a few others. I find a HOLLOW where I can rest and I yell to others to follow where I am -- shift: with my friend Cindy in a huge city that is strange to us; I study the map and mark the entrance to the freeway and write the name on the map, something like "Verrazano Bridge" (but we are not in New York).
