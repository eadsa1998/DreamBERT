I was in my car with my girlfriend. She said she wanted to take a long drive through the Grove, so we were driving along a very deserted road. I don't know what road, but it was extremely deserted and we were driving for a long, long time, perhaps 15, 20, 25 minutes. Finally I saw a street sign. It was very desolate. There was a street sign. It said about 240th Street. I was thinking, "Boy, we're really far out." One other part of the same dream, although I can't remember the exact connection. I believe it was the fact that I got out of the car there in the wilderness, somewhere. And later when we were back in the city or back closer to home I got out of the car and I felt something on my pants, and I brushed it off and stepped on it. And it was a bug of some kind, a white bug. I think a scorpion, a white scorpion. I was thinking that I must have picked it up out there in the wilderness. That's the end of the dream.(188 words)</span
