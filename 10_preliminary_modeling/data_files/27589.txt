I dreamed I was in a Political Science Class at a strange college which I had never seen. I sat in my seat and chewed "double bubble gum." I tried to get rid of the gum but the more I tried to more the gum would stick to my mouth. There was a fella sitting next to me. (I double dated with him that same evening before the dream.) He sat there and would make a mark after each name when they answered questions. I could not answer one question - but it didn't seem to bother me at all.
