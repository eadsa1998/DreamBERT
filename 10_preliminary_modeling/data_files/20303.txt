I met a young woman, and she questioned me about some best seller books to see what I knew. I knew about some of the books she mentioned. Later two young girls about ten were getting into a double bed in their room. They acted as though they were feeling erotic toward each other. They decided to lie head to foot. They got under the blanket and began to giggle. I don't recall getting into the bed, but I found myself there looking under the covers at them. As I watched, I had an emission, and they chided me for doing it.
