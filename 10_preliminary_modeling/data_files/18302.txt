A dream by the seashore, with my husband and my daughter and some couple of other people (a couple I didn't particularly care for). Waves suddenly came in from two directions and started to cut us off from shore. I ran up through the water to a wall and climbed it and got out. Then I looked back and saw everyone else trapped in the middle. My husband was half-buried in sand. I started crying and praying. My husband made it out, but everyone else was drowned. I was very happy to have him escape, but very upset that my daughter had drowned.
