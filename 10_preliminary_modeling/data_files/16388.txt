We were -- Samantha, Sandra and Derek were in town again, and we were watching a video for my 18th birthday party, which I sort of remember attending simultaneously. It was like we started watching the video and suddenly I was there, that kind of thing. I remember it was just like my graduation party except it was like a year after, only this is not really what my 18th birthday was like; this is how I dreamt it was like. We were at the Hilton and I focused in on this crystal chandelier that was like, "Whoo hoo, _________," because I had seen some crystal chandeliers in the ____ing catalog at the ramp (?) place. And somebody was sneaking in to do something, it was Sandra I think. Well, then I was like there at the party, and, you know, dancing and partying and stuff. And of all things, Sandra had Digital Performer on her laptop and she was like -- what should I say? -- recording and mixing the sound right there, kind of like what Dr. Moran was doing with Cake Walk in class -- no wonder! [laugh] I can't remember anything about what she was doing, but then the next thing I knew, we were in my studio and she wanted to transfer the tracks to my desktop so that I could work with them, and I did a lot of hokus pokus last ____ and stuff and she said that my task ____ board can do a lot more than what I usually use it for. And what it is, in reality, is that it takes a_____ audio, turns it into digital, sends it down a USB and __________ because digital audio from a USB converts it to, it's like an external sound card almost. That's why I don't need an internal one. And it also had faders and a couple other controls on it that you can move tactilely and it'll send mini messages to the real faders to move. And Da_____ ______ thought that that feature would be great for me because I'm more tactile than visual, but I found that it was a lot easier just to go to the mixer page and look at one channel at a time and move the faders there because the task scan doesn't have the automatically _______ faders which is clicked in the position when you open up the program like some do. It doesn't move automatically as you move the faders on the screen; it has to synchronize them. And that is a real pain, trust me. And but so Sandra was doing all these things ________, but like ______ teachers that don't help teach me and __________ haven't discovered it. She was doing it right from there, in my dream, of course. And I said, "Wow, I should be able to do that too." [laugh] And let's see, then here comes the most bizarre part. I was in this supermarket with Samantha, Sandra and Derek, and we were like tasting candy. There was this one mix of candy called Amazing Grace that had like white chocolate balls and different stuff, but I had this plastic sign banana thing with a picture of a wave form on it, and it was represented as of the audio from the Wave Form editor. And I was [laugh] down in this big center area, court like type thing in the supermarket with all kinds of people walking around. I was sitting there moving my finger along this sign banner, trying to highlight and edit the wave form. Now talk about bizarre. And I think shortly thereafter I woke up. You know, sometimes when I sit there doing all that editing, I say to myself, "I'm going to be seeing wave forms in my dreams."
