A group of us is putting on a skit of the play "The Importance of Being Earnest. "I have LOST my script, so we decide to improvise. shift: we are in a restaurant, sitting in booth and the woman Frank has visited in Nisswa is sitting in his lap. Frank gives her a book and says: "Whatever happens, I want you to have this book." Back at the theatre, I still cannot find my script, so we go ahead and improvise and pull it off OK.
