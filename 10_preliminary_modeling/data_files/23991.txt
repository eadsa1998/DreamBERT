My best friend had finally dragged me to another country, where she used to live. I was really happy that I was on vacation with my friend. I guess I was really happy that my dad had paid my way there. As soon as I got there, my friend (who is my age) and I went past a lot of beach vendors, selling things that were made of shells from that beach. Then we went on to the white sand beach. My friend put down a big towel where we both put shorts over our swimsuits. My friend was way ahead of me and already in the water. So I finished getting ready and ran down to the shore. There were the same shells as there are around my hometown, but they were bigger and brighter. The water was calm, soothing, and cool. It was light greenish-blue. Then I went deeper and deeper into the calm waves. Then the water started getting shallower. Pretty soon I was on another bar of beach. It was about 15 feet thick until the shore started again. I saw my friend really far out into the second water. This water was colder and darker and rougher. I went into the water and as soon as I did, I was terror-stricken. I saw a 50 foot wave coming at me. My friend was beyond where the wave started. I held my breath as deep as I could and let the wave take me. As I went up into the wave I woke up, and heard someone say my name. I asked my mother if she said anything, and she said no. I guess that last part was part of my dream.
