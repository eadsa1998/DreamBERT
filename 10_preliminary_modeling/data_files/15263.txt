I was friends with Ted and Marshall (How I Met Your Mother). Neither of them were dating or married. We were at a house and I was lying on a bed with Ted chatting and Marshall was in another room. Ted was flirting with me. They both liked me, but I was supposed to end up with Marshall. There was a lot of stuff on the bed and I saw something eating some maggots and I jumped up screaming 'ew'. Ted grabbed them and put them in his mouth, joking. I was grossed out and screamed and ran to the room where Marshall was. Ted had followed and Marshall asked what was wrong and Ted opened his mouth. I ran out and then Marshall said I had a bloody nose and I grabbed a tissue and held it to my nose. He said to Ted "help her" and I said it would go away quickly. Then my friend, who was a dog but not, went somewhere. I was driving on my own through a school zone and there were lots of lollipop men and kept sliding into the other lane. There was a Russian lady and she said she was going to learn the rest of English today and mentioned something about movies. There was something about the French and one of her lovers being somewhere. Then I was with Ted and Marshall again. They were throwing sprinkles at a board which revealed something. The Klowns from Killer Klowns From Outer Space were around. Someone was poisoned and I got to level 3 of 5 for something. I went into a room with a boy and saw the Klowns coming out of hiding. I was going to run, but decided to help the boy. I attacked the Klowns and ended up in a mirror. My dog friend, who looked like a person, came in and I banged on the mirror and told him to get out. He ducked out the window and I was then on a train? The dog had to tell them where I was and they found out eventually and came back for me. Then I was watching the real How I Met Your Mother and it showed Robin and Barney years later. She looked old and not like her. They had a one night stand.
