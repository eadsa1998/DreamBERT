I was downstairs by Grandma's and all at once water started to drip thru the ceiling in two rooms. I went upstairs and the water was running over the sink and on the floor. I told my mother why she didn't shut the water off and she said she didn't know the water was running. Later I went outside with Ann and my sister Sue came over. She had a cowgirl outfit on and a banjo. I went into the house and Ann stayed outside with Sue. I heard her play on the banjo.
