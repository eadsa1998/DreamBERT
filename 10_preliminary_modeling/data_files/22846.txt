I was in a ball park taking batting practice.  Whoever was pitching to me was throwing mostly high and inside pitches, and I was fouling most of them off the handle of the bat.  This made me very mad, because I could just feel all the power in my hands and the bat necessary to hit one far over the fence.   Once I swung hard and trickled a foul off to the left, off the handle of the bat, and noticed that the bat, a brown one, was broken.  I had a hard time choosing another one which felt as good in my hands.  I started to use one, but it was a fungo bat.  Another was too short.  Another one was pretty heavy.  The one I chose was kind of heavy too.  I never did get a good pitch to hit.
