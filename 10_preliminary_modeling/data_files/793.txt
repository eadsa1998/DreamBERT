I was teaching a young man to play the trumpet, even though I don't play one. I showed him how to play a clear note. Then I played a song. I was good. Some man of importance was watching. Then the volatile girlfriend of the young man came looking for him. She was very emotional. I followed them upstairs and hid in the closet to overhear. Then I felt badly about not being open, and came to them, like a counselor. He asked me to stay and listen. I did. The situation then cleared up. The girl and I went down steep stairs (like in the theater), and sat on stools. Mine was high. We hoped no one would question us because we had no tickets. Earl came by and handed his tickets at us thinking we were ushers.
