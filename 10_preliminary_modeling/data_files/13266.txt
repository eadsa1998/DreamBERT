Someone called me and at first it sounded like a robot, then like a transvestite and then like Autumn. It was Autumn, but I couldn't hear her properly. The next day she came up to me and she was having a party and she wanted me to come. Later, some girls asked me to be part of a robbery. At some point, Eugene and I were making out. Later, I was waiting to get picked up. I was standing with Darius and Eugene. Eugene and I were messing around, then Mom came. Roland and Clayton were in the back and Roland was in my seat. Ezra was in the front. Roland moved. I looked out the back window. Eugene looked at me and I waved and he waved back. Mom thought that I was acting weird.
