I remember this dream vaguely: All of us at home were going to the country where my uncle and aunt live. I saw myself traveling in our car; I was happy. Again I dreamt of myself as being of a younger age, around 12 or 13 years old; all of us were younger. It was daytime and there was plenty of sun. We arrived at their house and I was doing things a kid does. I was running in the garden and playing with the toys there, especially the seesaw, which is really the one I like best. My aunt and uncle and my cousins were also younger. All of us cousins were playing and we made lots of noise, even though I don't remember the exact words we were saying. Suddenly I saw myself alone and the garden looked so huge that it seemed to be the jungle. The trees were very tall and there was a lot of green. There were huge banana trees and in front of them I looked even smaller in size. I was alone. There was a breeze and the evening was coming; the sun was starting to set. I walked aimlessly. I wasn't walking fast; I was making way for myself among the plants. That's as far as I remember. At that point I woke up.
