I was in the doctor's office and I was having a baby. I could not see who the father was, but he was there, and he was happy. The delivery was so easy. One push and she was out. I was so happy; I loved her from that moment. The next thing I knew there were 6 babies. Now I had 8 children, but I was happy and I wanted them all. The doctor just left without talking to me about the babies and that upset me. The next thing I knew I was coming out of a building. I was skinny again and I had only one car seat in my car. However, I had just received many dozens of flowers, all from one person. I couldn't see who they were from, but I knew it was a male. I put them in the front seat under the car seat. It was night. I had only one baby with me. There was a baby toy that I had to take apart to put in the trunk. As I was shutting it, a car drove up and a man got out with a chain saw. I started to run and he started swinging his saw. It was off so I assumed it didn't work. He was swinging it at me and I stabbed him in the gut with a pair of scissors. After struggling some more, I stabbed him in the neck. Then he pulled out a gun. I was worried he would see the baby, but I ducked behind my car. All of a sudden a man who appeared to know me came out of the car next to me and shot the attacker, and he died. The next thing I knew the babies' father and I came out of the building and went to the car. In the car on the other side of us sat "the woman" who was attacked, who I thought was myself. She looked like me, wore the same clothes as me, and had her hair the same way.
