Dad and I got a prisoner tied and put him into a closet. Later we saw two men come out. We scrutinized them, then I saw one come out. I gave orders to capture him. He was our prisoner in disguise. He had guns on him. My man had a knife, but just like magic there were men on all sides of him and he was captured.
