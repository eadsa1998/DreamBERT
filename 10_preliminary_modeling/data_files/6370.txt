Funny dream last night. Kinda hard to remember it all, except Steve and I were doing a lot of serious ass-kicking, and what's really funny, Michelle, who I haven't even given thought to in months, asked me out in this dream, in this soft, weak voice. I was either playing a video game or a pinball game, or I was kicking a soda machine that wouldn't give me its soda. Anyway, I was preoccupied, and when I heard her say "Wanna go out with me," I stopped with an amused look on my face, and, after a silence -- presumably I was thinking -- I said, "Sure, guess so." I woke up then at 9:30.
