 I'm in Tressel with my friend Kevin Simpson. We're driving, towing my boat behind our vehicle. We go to a drive in place where I see my junior high classmate Erin Jacobs working. We go up to buy something. I have some desire to talk to Erin, despite ambivalence. We don't talk. Two men leave with us. We ask them where the mall is. They say they mall is closed, but they will go with us, and one of them has keys to the mall. We drive near the Superhighway 200 exit near Earthton, where the Happy Chef Restaurant is.
