We are visiting some friends and our children are still small; Reynaldo is still a baby and I have to change his diaper; I leave and meet Frank at another place; Frank says he left Reynaldo at a nursery school. I go and find Reynaldo and bring him to the place we are visiting. As we get ready to leave, Frank runs ahead of me and I get mad: I yell:"Frank DON'T YOU DARE RUN AWAY FROM ME LIKE THAT.... OR I'LL DIVORCE YOU....Frank stops and stands immobile in front of the door; we find our car and ride home together. no apologies. (woke up with heart pounding)
