I am visiting a historical home of Edgar Allen Poe. I walk down several flights of carpeted stairs that are steep, with no handrails. I have to be careful and I trip and slip a few times. I go into his bedroom. There is a man laying on his bed, which is a water bed. The shirt (blue flowers on a white background) is over the body of the man, head and all. He gets up and leaves. I go out into the hall and say, "Which wa?." "You choose," is the answer. There is a narrow stairway going down. I pass it and go across the hall to the Press Room. He has a letter press. I touch the metal letters and symbols in awe. I see "mats" of advertising and see sports emblems, noticing one for the Grizzlers (M City High). I am pleased. I think they must be bored here because they always see the same samples. I turn and go back down the hall. I turn left into his parents' bedroom. The dresser looks ordinary, but the bed is strange. There's an open hole in the middle with metal pieces, like a dining room table that opens to put in extra leaves. I think, "That must be where they keep the extra blankets and covers."
