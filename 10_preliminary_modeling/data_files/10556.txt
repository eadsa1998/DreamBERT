Pedro comes to the house and wants me to go swimming with him (as we usually do). We look thru the whole house, every shelf, every closet, but we CANNOT FIND my bathing suit. He finally leaves. I say, "I guess I will have to buy a new one." A group of Irish relatives come to the house; one of them is a cousin whom I knew about from a family tree. (In reality I have no cousins at all.)
