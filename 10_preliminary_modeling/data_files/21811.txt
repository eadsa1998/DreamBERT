We were on the coke yard and there came an airplane and it was an enemy. We were told to duck down. there were bombs dropped and we were attacked. Then we got an order to hide from the radiation. Loddie Fousek was running in the lead. We went around the corner of the ovens. I looked up and saw a radar apparatus in the air. Then we rested on the other side of the coke ovens and got the signal the fallout was over. Then we came back and there were young men who were going to attack the invaders. Ann had about 6 dresses to sell. We passed a house about 500 ft. away from it and I'm not sure if we waved and the girls waved back at us. We signaled or yelled to them if they needed any dresses. They said they would like to see them. Then to our surprise someone had a pile of girl's bloomers in front of our door as a gift or present to us. Then later there were more, but these were for us to wash.
