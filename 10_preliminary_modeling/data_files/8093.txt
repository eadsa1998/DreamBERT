I thought Matthew had come home. He was working in his bedroom, cleaning out his closets and such. He was carrying stuff outside. I went upstairs to talk to him. I wanted to talk to him alone. I wanted to ask him if he and I would ever have the chance to talk alone anymore, since he has been dating Ashley B. It seems that I never have anytime to talk to him alone. I never have anytime alone with him at all. I got very upset with him, but I'm not sure why. It may have been related to church, but I'm not sure. It also seems that I thought one of the maintenance men from WN was there working on the apartment but I don't know what he was doing. He had left the screen door open. Another time he was doing something upstairs and had the water running. it was leaking through the ceiling to the first floor. I felt frustrated with him and told him what was happening. I also had this sense, and I don't know where this fits. it may be something separate. I really wanted to wake up but couldn't. I had reached out to the coffee table and was pulling myself, trying to pull myself to wake myself up.
