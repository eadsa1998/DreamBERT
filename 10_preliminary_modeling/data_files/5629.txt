I have screws in my arm, the arm that is in the cast, where the bones are being fused. One day the screws came loose and fell out. When I called the doctor, she told me that the insurance company would not pay for their replacement so I went down to the basement and took a screwdriver and put them back in myself. I called the doctor to tell her and we started laughing and the doctor said that I would be welcome to work on Mondays, putting screws in peoples' arms.
