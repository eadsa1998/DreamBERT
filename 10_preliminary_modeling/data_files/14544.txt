David and Keith (both Six Feet Under) rented a motel because he got one of "the last ten tickets" to a show. The motel was stingy. Then it was Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) and a girl he liked. It also changed to Laura Roslin and Bill Adama (Battlestar Galactica). But then she was actually someone else and everyone had had their memories wiped. She was no longer interested in him. Then it was Eugene and I. The room had a little TV in it and there was a video player on the other side of the room (the door was in the middle of the room, the bed was on the left side, TV in front of it on the right and the video player straight ahead). I was unplugging the video player because there was a red light on it, which would annoy me and was closing the window. We got in bed and he turned off the TV. It was a double bed, but it was more like a single and we had to snuggle up. I think other people were then in the other rooms, Calvin was one of them. Eugene and I were having sex and Ezra came in, but we didn't realize at first.
