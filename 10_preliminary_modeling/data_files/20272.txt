My mother and sister were with me in a tunnel. There was a column about 10 feet high which did not quite touch the ceiling. It was moving toward us. (I observed later upon reading these three dreams, the similarity between the car in the street, the plank in the cavern, and the column in the tunnel.) I had a last dream, vaguely recalled, in which I seem to have had a thought that I would make a magnificent woman, and then seeing myself clearly as a slender, but masculine man and repudiating my first concept of myself.
