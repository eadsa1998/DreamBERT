["Movies date and rapist."] Chris of my discussion circle and I decide shyly to go to a movie together. I go ahead and walk down a hall where lots of movie rooms are, one after a other. I come to the end one, with a start time of 9pm I walk in and lot of people are there. Some man is announcing who gets to clean up. I see a blind young man with a white cane trying to sweep up. I realize Chris may not be able to find which Movie I picked, so I went back down the hall and looked into another move room. I see him at the front looking for me. I go in and sit, at the back. He had seen me and walks back to join me. We shyly flirt and talk. There are some rowdy men up front. One eyes me and makes lewd remarks about taking me right there. He is seated in a chair and I am sitting on the floor. I pretend to agree, pretending to be sexy. He is leering and moving toward me. As he gets close, I kick him in the groin. Several times. He is angry. Chris and I start running. He is running after us. I see his overall jeans and hear his regular clopping steps a he is gaining on us. We run back to Chris's dorm room. I was going to go on to my dorm, but Chris says no, come in with me. We'll fool him. We try hard to lock the front door. He is methodically running after us and gaining. We go to Chris's room and try to fake a turn to anther room. He isn't being fooled. I am afraid. He will find us and hurt us,
