I had a dream that my family and I were all going somewhere, but I can't remember where it was or why we were all there. My mother and I wanted to go home early, so we took one of the cars. We were at a rest stop, when I realized that we had somehow taken both cars, but I hadn't been driving. My mother said she had been driving each car in shifts, because they were both some kind of new stick shift I didn't know how to drive yet. I was also dreaming about floating down some river with other RAs, and that was our mid-year training. Later, Gage and I were talking, and he was telling me about how every couple in our grade was breaking up before graduation. I was shocked, but really relieved that I wouldn't have that same problem.
