Dinosaurs were alive and were killing everyone. We were at Mom's house and this guy who made the dinosaurs told me and Eric Christian Olsen to call for pizza. We rang people to get rid of the dinosaurs. Then we were somewhere else, outside, throwing flares at the dinosaurs, and we ran out of them so we threw nuggets at a plateosaurus -- which was actually a good dinosaur and helped us get rid of the rest of the dinosaurs.
