I am in a room, probably at school. Eva and Doris are there. I have some school books (and, I think, a CD case). I try to pick up the books but they keep falling. I need to get to Mrs. Wright's class, but I can't carry all of my books. I think I try to put them in my locker (although I can't remember that scene). Then, I go to Mrs. Wright's class, to tell her I'm sorry for being late and I need to get my books in my locker. I'm outside the door, ready to go in, when I see a kitten in the door, waving at me. I now realize I should just get my books and go to Mrs. Wright's class when I've gotten my books. I remember a dream, possibly from a third person perspective, where I'm a young man looking for success. I know this isn't me. He doesn't have my personality and I don't even think he looked like me. I really don't remember much here, except that he was a strange person, funny in a way. I expect people to give me money if I do something or other. I've got a couple pieces of paper that could have been something like tax forms or a stock market portfolio, but I don't remember. A teacher comes up to "me" (or "him," interchangeable pronouns) and wants me to help her with something in the classroom. A student starts speaking fairly fluent Latin, and I laugh and think this student is dumb because he/she was "only" speaking Latin. I don't know what I was expecting.
