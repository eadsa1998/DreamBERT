There were a lot of people. I got a pair of shoes out of the refrigerator and was going to put ice cubes in each one. When I got ready to do that I realized that the pair I had was not a pair after all. the shoes did not match. Mother and Daddy were sitting across the room from me. It was a very large room. Daddy said, do you see five spiders there around you? There was someone else close to me and that she said yes. He counted them. We realized they were hidden microphones. Someone was spying on us. They were very, very tiny. They looked like little black dots. Two of them were in the air in front of me. I tried to use one of my ice cubes and swat at it. I missed. I heard mother say, Anna. Anna.
