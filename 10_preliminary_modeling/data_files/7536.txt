Mary phones me. This entire dream shows me talking on the phone to Mary. At first we exchange pleasantries, then I ask her where she is. She tells me she has a job and won't be home for a few days. Her job is in a small store and she must descend a steep stairwell or pit and get some bottles and bring them upstairs. Apparently this job is very particular and not anyone can do it. Mary is filling in for the regular person who has this job. He is ill or on holiday and Mary agreed to cover for him. I can hear a man's voice in the background expressing pleasure at how well Mary is doing the job. I tell Mary I'm pleased she has a job, but express concern because it seems to have some dangers in it. I'm particularly concerned that she not injure her leg (the thin one) and share my concerns with her. Mary says she can understand my concern, but that we can talk about this later. Although I'm on the phone with her, I can see Mary (vaguely) at her place of work, and it looks terrible. She is at the bottom of a shaft and while it is not deep, the stairs are very steep. The place seems dank and dark and damp. The dream ends where Mary, laughingly, says she understands my concerns but we can talk about it later. I tell Mary that if I know her, it means we won't talk about this again, that she'll stay on the job until the regular guy returns in a day or two, when Mary will come home. Mary just laughs at my observation.
