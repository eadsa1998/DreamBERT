Isaak gave me Chicken Treat [as in, the store]. The other people who worked there (all different) and I tried to work out a schedule. I said 'it's my birthday in a few days/weeks'. Then it turned out it was actually January 27 today and I was like 'what the hell, I thought it was the 4th!'. I posted on Facebook saying 'It was my birthday 2 days ago and I didn't realize'.
