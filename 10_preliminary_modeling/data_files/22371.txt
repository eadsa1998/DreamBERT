I see myself dressed in my fencing uniform (white). I have a sword in my hand, but it isn't a fencing sword, but rather a medieval sword. A., who is a man about 60 whom I regard like a father, comes over and asks me for the sword. I give it to him and he buries it by sticking it up to the handle in the dirt that is beside some sort of table. He takes out a white handkerchief and puts it in front of the sword. What follows is unclear. He then asks me about a boy who is rather far from where we are. He asks me if he should give his powers to him, because he had pronounced the "Om," and has done it without having been taught it. I tell him not to, because even though he has said it without having been taught, he has done it badly and this is dangerous.
