My wife and I and some friends have dinner in a tavern somewhere and we go on home and the next morning we realize that we have left some things at the tavern, including our guitar and our liquor cause it seems we're in a place where you have to bring your own liquor, like a tavern, because you can't buy it directly. I go back to the tavern, which is very much like a place in my hometown and I notice that they have a package store to sell liquor which doesn't jibe with having to bring our own, but nevertheless I go on in. I go to the bar and the waitress there remembers me and gives me the guitar and a bottle of gin that was ours and a bottle of brandy and a glass of beer that's half drunk. I take the stuff and go out in the car. I'm not sure whether the brandy is ours or not really, but there's just a tiny bit in the bottom, so I figure it doesn't make much difference anyway.
