I went to President Crafts' office and waited there while Ira had some talk with him. I saw a week's program on the wall. It was the usual scheme: squares representing hours. Some periods were marked: Bliss, others, "Purgatory" and others "Hell." The table included Sunday, which was labeled "In the fear of the Lord."
