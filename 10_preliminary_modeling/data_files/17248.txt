We had gone somewhere at night.  Somehow related to my brother Stuart.  An event of one of his friends?  Turned around early to go back for some semi-urgent purpose.  On a skateboard?  Then was trying to get my mother into the airport inconspicuously.  A famous man was going to be there- my mother was a photographer trying to get his picture.  She passed through the metal detectors fine without a ticket.  I followed a minute or so later.  It looked more like the lobby of a nice old theatre than an airport.  I found her standing up ahead in one of several crowded lines.  The guy came in and walked down one of the lines, and everyone moved aside.  I don't think my mother got the picture.  We were now going to try and get on the plane.  I was in a wheelchair to be a distraction, getting help onto the plane.  It worked.  Getting off, my mother was in the chair.
