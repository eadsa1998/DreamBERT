[1997-05-05] I am at Redwood and there's a swimming pool but it looks really strange, there's a part that's really shallow which you have to get into first before you can get into the real part, so I hadn't gotten into the real part yet but had only gotten into the shallow part before I woke up, and I could sense that the shallow part was a different shape, and there were some people sitting around in the shallow part and they told me that I would have to go by them to get to the deep part and the re were like two different sections and you had to climb over this funny section before you could get to the real swimming part. And then we were at the Redwood school where I went when I was really little for that pool part of the dream and then we were in my house and people had come to my house and there were kids and they went into my pocket book and they moved all my stuff around and I was trying to figure out what they had done, and they took my signature guide and they took the top off of it so that I couldn't use it anymore and I wasn't very happy about that and I told them that. I noticed that on the signature guide the top was missing one corner so that it didn't go straight across and it wasn't a rectangle anymore, and I was trying to figure out what they were doing and why they were messing up all of my stuff. In the middle of it, one of my client's case records were on my bed too, all my Braille notes to them, not the print ones and I was looking at them and reading them and going through them and figuring out what was going on with that.
