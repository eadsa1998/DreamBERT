Father Andrew and I go to a "church" that is really a jewelry store. Every time we go there, there is some emergency. I remember seeing a man Iying on the floor, injured from glass cuts. Did he try to steal something? Father Andrew seems unperturbed, but asks if he can do anything to help. Later I try to place a wooden cross over the counter on a nail. Father Andrew adjusts the cross.....
