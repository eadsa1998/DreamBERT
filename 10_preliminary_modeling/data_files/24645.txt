I saw lots of commercials and ads for real companies, but every once in a while I would see a fake one. This was the second dream I had that night, so it was only about half an hour or twenty minutes or something. I only saw about twenty commercials and ads before I woke up. It looked like it was on TV. Setting: I don't know. I think maybe I was watching TV in my family room. Characters: Lots of people in commercials, but I didn't really see them very well. And of course, I didn't know them. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy. I'm not really sure how I felt because I wasn't really there. I don't know if I was in the dream.
