Ezra was supposed to be spending the night outside with some mates and came home early. They had some drinks. There was a girl who had this extra thing on her foot and was a bit retarded. Mom was also there.There was a video of an Asian girl in some water with flowers, but they were actually like beads that she was wearing. An Asian guy took her hand and they walked out. Then I was with them. We went into a building and there were steps to the top floor which was an empty room with two chairs. One had water on it, so I sat on the floor. The guy paid me to dance with him. I went out for a second and this lady came and she was like some government lady and she asked what was going on. I said 'some weird stuff' and ran down. She asked me where I'd been on the 4 June. I said I didn't know. She said someone had told her something and that I was there at some funeral and then went back to my place.
