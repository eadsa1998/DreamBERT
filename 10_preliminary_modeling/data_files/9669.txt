Visit Frank's parents with Zena: see small room with many dolls; I must change a baby's diapers; very wet and lots of mess; - walk downstairs with grandfather: he is wearing brown pants and shoes, but looks quite old; we walk in familiar streets, then ride on train: many new buildings: most of them half finished. (!) We ride past an unusual train with many books, like a library car; - also see POPE PAUL VI: first his picture, then Pope himself; very happy &amp; I say: "I saw the Pope." - Take communion from Father Andrew; he is wearing a white robe.
