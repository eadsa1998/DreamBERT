A native American man is telling a story in some auditorium. I listen. He comes up to me later and wants to meet me and get my opinion. He likes me intensely. I have two daughters who are sleeping on a pile of coats. This is a pow-wow kind of thing. He kisses me passionately. He wants me. I am very attracted and turned on, but I hesitate and say, "I have to take the girls home." He says, "We can find a place for them to sleep here." He says, "We don't have to make love now, or anything, but please just stay." He says it with such strong need and desire and love for me. I kiss him passionately. I will stay.
