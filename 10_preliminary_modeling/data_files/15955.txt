I was at the Technical College and I was running late for class but wanted to get lunch. I got this wrap thing which was chicken with lettuce and tomato. I got to class and Mr Jennings was the lecturer. The desk layout was like a square 'C' with the open part at the front where Mr Jennings was. Tristan was at the desk on the left side as you came in the room and Fletcher was next to him on his left. I sat next to Tristan on the right. They had already started class and had been handed out cards. They all had different things on them - items or pets or people. He was handing out a different number of cards to each person and it was supposed to force a divide in the room or something, make some people arrogant about the number of cards or what cards they had etc. Mr Jennings gave me one card and it had a picture of a cartoon elephant and was called Bop. I said to Tristan 'I have the best one'. I was eating my wrap in class and it was very messy and there was lots of lettuce. Sometimes it was steak instead of chicken.
