We were going on a class field trip to a big lake where Melissa, our science teacher, would teach us about the different rocks. We started looking where the really smooth sand was. We found some really cool rocks like granite, limestone and sandstone. We found a really large piece of pumice. It fell into the lake and I ran after it. I feel in the lake and the lake turned into a river with white water. Setting: On a sandy area by a lake, and a rushing river. Characters: My science teacher, Melissa; my classmates Helen, Jean, Arlie, Marisa, Jessica, Rochelle, Cara, Lydia, Amy and my two friends Ellie and Starla. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, excited. I was really excited when we found the really big piece of pumice, but when I feel in a river I was scared.
