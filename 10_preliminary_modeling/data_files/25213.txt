 I'm with Annie in my neighbor Gary Stein's front yard. We are having sex in an indentation in the lawn by the hill that goes down in front of their house. We have a blanket that is underneath us. It might be the quilt that Grandma Ramona gave my brother Wally. We have sex for a long time. I change positions a few times. A car pulls up to the side of the road. We quickly leave. We go up to the porch of Stein's house. Then go inside and upstairs. A lady is there. We as her, "Can we hump here?" She says yes. We go in a room. Annie leaves the room for a moment. She says she might lose her erection. I am kind of confused, but figure it might be something to do with her arousal. We have sex some more. She is wearing the red sundress with the red and white flowers that she has. The lady comes back. We hear her and get dressed. The landlord barges into the room, but we are dressed. One of us says, "See; they're not humping." The lady went to get the landlord. Annie and I walk out of the room. There is a baby in a crib. I touch its cheek, and say how cute it is. It is taking me a long time to ejaculate. We go over by the gray house next to my other neighbor Alvin Broud's house. The lights are on. I want to have sex where it is dark. We have the blanket. I am wearing my maroon colored corduroy pants. Annie's vagina is very wet and very loose. We try a lot of different positions.
