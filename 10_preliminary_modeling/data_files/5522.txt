Last night I dreamed that I was in a group of people, men and women and children and we were on the shore of a very attractive lake which did not look at all familiar to me. Everyone was in the water at times, and somebody brought me a very peculiarly shaped, rubber boat of some type, and I just fir perfectly into it. It was inflated and I could remember my feet just slipped into and made it into a place which was made for someone's feet. The whole thing seemed to be made for my body in a sitting position.
