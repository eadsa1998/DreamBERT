At the start of the dream I was sitting at a table with my parents eating mashed potatoes. The table was out in the street in front of our house. On each plate was a pile of potatoes about three feet high and I imagined that these potatoes were made from the insides of snakes. I then saw an automobile coming down the street and wondered how it would get past the table. The scene then changed. My car was parked in a vacant field and I had lost the keys. I spent a long time looking for the keys but never found them. I then noticed that both of the rear tires were flat. I fixed the tires, but my father ridiculed me since I didn't have any keys to operate the car. Again the scene changed. I was in Korea operating a side show. My act involved the use of two serpents. I would twist and contort one of the serpents while the other rested. I would then repeat the act with the other serpent.
