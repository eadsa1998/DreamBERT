I am at a lecture at church. Frank comes in late, wearing a red scarf. (It looked like a prayer shawl.) He sits next to Bud and me; it is early spring: view of bright blue sky and new leaves on trees. It is beautiful. But we cannot stay there; we have some car trouble in the garage: oil smell. He tilts car up. I leave and go back to lecture. Also talk to a man on my left, a priest, who listens to what I have to say about coincidences. But he still mostly laughs it off. Boat stranded on Lake Columbus and someone at church rescues it. Sara S. getting out of bed and getting dressed.
