I am in bed and feel something touch me. At second touch I find it is some person. I ask the time. "6 a.m." "Then I can sleep a little longer" and I readjust sleepshade. But they are talking about World War III which seems to be imminent. I think I'll have to pack my things. I can get most of them in the shabby blue trunk.
