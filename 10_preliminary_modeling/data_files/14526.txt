Mom was watching a movie and I went out and it was Beetlejuice. It was in French and so I changed the language for her. Later, Ezra said her phone kept ringing and it was loud. He was with a baby, as in, he had to sleep in the same room as it. On the TV, it said 'Will Arnett' and there was an Arrested Development advertisement, which he, Portia de Rossi and Michael Cera were in. Will Arnett and Michael Cera were supposed to be more like 'father and son' in the movie (or whatever). We went for a drive. Ezra got a call from Roland, who said he was at a rave or something and he went to the toilet and was 'pooping' and thought of Ezra. There were two cars in front of us, the drivers of which were obviously drunk. There was a set of lights up the road. One of the cars slid out and went into a ditch. Then there was a bridge near us and the other one went over the edge. We stared in shock and it was slow motion and then a crash and it flipped and was totally owned. I was happy about seeing this because it was exciting. Then the cops were there and I was thinking of what I rate it. Mom asked "what should we rate it?" and I was thinking a 4/5 because of the bridge.
