 I arrive at a gymnasium where an Armstrong alumni basketball game is going to take place. I walk in with my old teammate Ron Lind and another man. Our old coach, Jackson Shooter, is happy to see me. He looks different. My old classmate Todd Mahoney is there, as well as several older men in their 30's and 40's. Jackson comes over and we shake hands. I put my left hand on his back, as I lean in for a hug. He doesn't seem to want to hug me. It is a slightly uncomfortable, restrained, half-hug,.
