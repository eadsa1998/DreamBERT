My mother and I were walking on E1-- St. between E-- and C--. There were many small shops on the street selling millinery and ladies' clothing. All the stores were closed. (This did not seem unnatural; it must have been Sunday.) As I looked in one store, I saw a woman putting hats into a drawer. As we passed, she looked up and I was surprised to recognize her. (We had lived on the same street for 10 years.) I have not seen her for 2 years. She beckoned to us to stop. Then she opened the door and let us in. We talked and she told me she was selling Bissell carpet sweepers and could get us a good discount. Mother said to me confidentially that maybe she ought to buy a Bissell at a discount instead of the electric sweeper she had been wanting. I remember that all the while we were talking, I kept looking at her and thinking how attractive she had become.
