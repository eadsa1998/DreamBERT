 I'm at my girlfriend Annie's house in a room that is not normally there. I am talking to Annie's sister Tina. Annie's sister Jessica and her boyfriend James are sitting on the couch. Later, I think the boy is the Thomas' cousin. Annie comes into the room. She has just gotten up from sleep. She asks me softly how long I've been here. She is angry that I was at her house and she didn't know it. She is on the cough, and I am on the floor next to the couch. We wrestle jokingly.
