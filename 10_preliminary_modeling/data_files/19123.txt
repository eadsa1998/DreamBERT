I was in my aunt's bedroom and sleeping there was my sister and two of my female cousins. In the dream my sister seemed as if she were about 15 years old and my two cousins were about 5 and 9. I believe I walked into the room and noted the three of them sleeping in the bed. The sheets were all disarrayed and I noticed some holes or tear spots in the pajamas of my youngest cousin, and was thinking that at this young age, if one could see the genitals it really didn't make for much anxiety on either side, that is the observer and the observee's side. Then I was sitting on the edge of the bed and my aunt came by. She too seemed really younger than she is now. I felt some slight embarrassment in relationship to my aunt. I'm not sure whether it was because I had some sexual thoughts about her or what. As I was sitting on the bed, I had a loose leaf notebook cover over my lap because then I was thinking about how difficult these girls were going to eventually find it when the implications of the castration complex and menstruation reached them. In the dream the reality of the castration complex seemed very strong and it now seemed most natural that this would represent a traumatic area for girls to adjust to.
