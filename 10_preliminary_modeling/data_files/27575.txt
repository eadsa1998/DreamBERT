Several of my girl friends and I were in a deserted old farm house in the middle of enemy territory. The house had no furniture in it at all. (Except that later a crib appeared) We were sitting around not saying very much when we saw another girl and a child outside. We offered them shelter from the night and the soldiers. The chi]d, around 3-4 yrs., went to sleep in the crib. Shortly after that I saw a small group of enemy soldiers with flashlights coming toward the house. I ran to the crib and had to struggle to get the child out over the high sides. I kept hoping that the child would not start crying and yelling. My one object was to keep out of the way of the beams from the flashlights. I had to keep dodging around to do this, and could not get back to the front of the house where the others were. Once I felt the light shining on my face, but it moved on. To escape detection I put the baby and my se]f up against the outside wall of the house - (on the floor.)
