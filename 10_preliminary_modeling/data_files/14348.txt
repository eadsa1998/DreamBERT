I went to University. I went with a couple who were really chatty. One of them was going to work in a different country. Dad sent me a text with names of songs and told me to act confident. My class was math and it was like the introduction. We had a male teacher and he gave me a problem, but I had no paper or books so he gave me paper. Then he began talking about Africa and how people from TV shows went there and he mentioned someone from Heroes. As we left, I think, I was with some people and Raj (The Big Bang Theory) and others were standing next to me. Raj was talking to someone and then realized he was talking with girls around. Then someone thought I liked my teacher and I was thinking 'ew, he looks like Ric Ocasek' and 'All I Wanted' was playing. I was walking to the library and I saw Darius hanging around near it. I went in and was on the second level. It was small and there were a couple of shelves with a few books on them. It was crowded with young kids and they were there for a speech. The teacher closed the door and so I opened it and left. I walked down and went to the lower level. There was a shop in there and it was huge and the section next to me was girl's clothes. I was thinking it was bigger than the K-Mart we'd been in the other day. There was another girl with me and she was like 'whoa'. I was going to take a photo of the place to show Mom but the menu on my phone was different and I didn't know what to do. I turned off the sound first and then got confused. There were lots of people. I was walking around and I was in the men's section and there was a long sleeved shirt and I touched it and it was really soft. It was $100. Then this lady discovered the girl I was with wasn't with the University and asked me if I also wasn't and I said "I'm a student". I walked around to the desk later and it was the lady who had caught the girl out. I said I needed to get my ID card and she took me to the computer area.
