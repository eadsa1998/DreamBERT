["Weird eyes in trouble."] I am in a room. It is dark. Ellie comes in and I want her to replace the two broken or burnt out light bulbs. Then she brings a bucket full of water for my tired achy feet. I notice that the water in the bucket recedes and returns, like a tide. Not only that, but the floor of the room is a foot under water and that water recedes and returns as well. I am concerned this will cause damage from the water. Ellie isn't too concerned.
