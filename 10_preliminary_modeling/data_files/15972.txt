I was young, like 4. I had an older brother, who was Classmate-M-27. He was having a party and there were a bunch of teenage girls and boys there. I was sitting in the car with some of them and they were asking each other which illnesses they had. One person asked about the clap and one person put their hand up and I congratulated them for being honest. He later got annoyed with me and left me in the back of the car with the doors locked and left it in neutral. It started going out onto the road and I tried opening the door, but it wouldn't open. So I wound down the window, opened the door from the outside and jumped out. My mother (different) came home later and realised what had happened (she put the 'clues' together and knew he had done it on purpose). She was upset and angry at him, but we didn't know where he was. There was a weird red flash of light outside. It happened again later and I mentioned it to my father. He looked worried and made us go out the other door. He had a topless car and I got in and the seats in front were bent so they were almost horizontal and I hid under those as I saw the lights happen again and something peered over the top. I screamed and the thing ran. I could only see it properly out of the corner of my eye and I was scared.
