Ezra, Jayson and I were at some place that had Chicken Kiev. But it had maggots and stuff in the building. We cut the Kiev open. Then we were all sitting/lying on this glass thing which was sort of resting on this other thing, so when we moved, it would tilt (in the air). There was another one near us, which two people were dancing on. We turned to look and then Ezra made it go spazzy and Jayson and I fell off except some glass part came too and Ezra was fine. We fell into the water. We got out and there was this futuristic place with all these buildings and there was a little boat thing that went underneath the place which was on top of the water. Now, one part of the story was that I was old and I was thinking back, and the other was that I had dreamed it before, but before we knew Jayson, and he was replaying it in first person, and then it was a movie we hadn't seen for ages.
