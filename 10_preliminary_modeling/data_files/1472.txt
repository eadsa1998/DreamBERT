I am trying on clothes, looking for the right outfit to go out with this guy. Nothing fits and it all looks tacky. My purple slacks don't look good, too informal. Ellie comes in then with her prom dress on a hanger. I suggest I borrow it. I put it on. It's a bit tight. It's multi-colored with big cloth roses on the hem. [BL]
