I was in one of two couples, we were all playing sexually for a while, playing around the house, talking too.  Then I had to leave, either I got disturbed by it or mad or tired, not an altogether happy departure.  I had brought many small objects and items of jewelry with me to this house, and in our play the whole evening they had gotten moved and scattered.  I was trying to get my stuff together to leave, trying to separate my stuff from theirs, but there were so many tiny things, I got to a point where I didn't care if I left my stuff and they got my things.  I left a lot of things, but before I left, the other female picked up a small pink elephant's head trying to decide whose it was.  I knew it was mine, but she said it wasn't, that I hadn't brought it.  I knew I had brought it and thought of detailed evidence to tell her how I knew it was mine, how I had brought it.  All the other things I didn't care if I left, but this elephant head I really wanted, I didn't want anyone else to have it.  I was adamant and worried I wouldn't be able to win it back.  The elephant head was a soft material, sort of pliable, like gummy bear or rubber ball material.
