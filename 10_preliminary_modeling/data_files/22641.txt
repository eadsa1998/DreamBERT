It was very strange. Some of us (I don't know who, they were nice) were on top of a construction. I felt the presence of a man whose goal it was to cause us sorrow and confusion. He was with a woman. I couldn't see their faces, and then he fell off and died. We came down with assurance, without fear of the height, and the city was unsettled and the streets were somewhat empty. In the distance I saw a boy in my house, and I felt I didn't wish to meet him and remember disagreeable situations. I wanted the past to be forgotten. I found myself at home, and he was looking for me because he wanted to speak to me, but it was useless. I didn't feel it. It was something alien to me. He was the same; nothing had changed.
