I was doing something and then I was somewhere else. I was four or something. Nana was over and I had school books. I had ripped them and I put tape on them but Nana complained and took it off and put that cover stuff on. It had Pokemon on it. I discovered that just before I arrived, I had hit my head and had gone back in time. I was hoping that I didn't have to do school again.
