["Derek makes me angry"]  I am trying to do something. To get something done. Derek interferes, teasing me and stopping me from accomplishing what I am trying to do. I am very angry at him but I choose not to blow up. I hold in my anger, because I know he is deliberately trying to provoke me. He is acting like Charla does. I am trying to be loving in spite of the provocation.
