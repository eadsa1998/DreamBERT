C.H. was coming for me at 9 a.m. I was almost ready when I realized I would need to take my nightie and I began looking for my small red suitcase. We were lined up for dinner. At last I reached the table. There were two long tables at right angles with food on. I picked up a plate with potato, meat and string beans on it and go to the far end of one table where H. sits. She has piled wraps on the chair next to her. The others haven't followed me. I go back to them to tell them there are plenty of empty seats near H. They are seated in a half circle. I ask them why they are waiting. They say something about being supposed to at the college.
