I decided to start refinishing one of the pieces of furniture in Matthew's room. It was a small piece, not one that he has in waking life. I hadn't cleaned it first. I had a partial spray can of primer so I thought I could at least do this one piece and see how it turned out before doing the others. I started spraying the outside of it with the primer. The bottom of this piece of furniture was open, with no drawers or doors. Then I started spraying the inside of the panels. There were two small stuffed animals sitting on the bottom of this part of it, along with some shelves and two small strips of wood. As I was spraying with one hand I was moving these things with the other. I didn't want to get primer on the stuffed animals. I didn't mind getting it on the shelves or wood strips because I was going to spray them anyway, but had to lay them out separately so I could do that, and move them so I could spray the area where they had been laying. Amy Wynn came in from the TV program Trading Spaces and was talking to me about what I was doing.
