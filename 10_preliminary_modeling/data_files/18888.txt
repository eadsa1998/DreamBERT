I remember being at work, a parking garage on Biscayne Blvd. I was on the second floor with a lot of my friends, although the only person that I can remember actually seeing was my brother. It seemed as though we were all watching something on the street below, but I can't recall what it was. I remember that we were looking over the side and that there was a large black car parked just behind us.
