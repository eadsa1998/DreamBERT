It was night time about 3 a.m. and the streets were deserted. I was riding a bicycle on the sidewalk. I started out from my house and followed a very definite route (which has been the same each time that I have had the dream) winding up on my own street in the end. I took particular notice of various stores and other familiar landmarks along the way and got some feeling of satisfaction out of recognizing them. It was altogether pleasurable to be riding all alone through the familiar streets at night.
