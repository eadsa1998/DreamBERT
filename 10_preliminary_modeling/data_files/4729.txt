["Eastern Indian sexual rituals."] I am watching as the men of eastern India hand a small metal square to a woman they are in relationship with. She sits on it so that the vagina lips touch the metal and then she is consumed by sexual passion and they make love. I watch as one couple after another do this. Some of the women have figured out how to have their own metal square and chose the man they want. I see Bootsie has been chosen by another cat. She sits in a pretty ceramic bowl and he has his bowl right next to her. He is kind to her. I am glad for her. I am also concerned because a black cat who is not kind is near by and if the kind cat leaves it will take over. A dark skinned black curly haired tall man wants a beautiful daughter of the house and tries to catch her with his square. I feel very sexually excited.
