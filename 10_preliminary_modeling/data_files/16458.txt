First, the first little theme part was that somebody was pregnant and they didn't want their baby, so they somehow transferred it into Mom's body, and I guess she even acted like a mama duck sitting on her eggs. She was sitting there in like her flowing robe singing, "La La Loo," to help the baby grow, and I had to harmonize with her if I wanted to help create the baby. And so I did, and I saw in this particular scene she was on a little chair on the upstairs landing. And then, jumping to the next scene, we were on this boat and it was all dark. It was like a semi-big like private sailboat or something, and it had these tight quarters inside the cabin, and we were going up to the second floor of the cabin for some reason. And something was wrong with the boat, and in order to get it repaired, the man who was out on the boat with us had to go up to the second floor of the cabin, which you just kneel and you couldn't stand up in the second floor of the cabin. And he had to lay down in this bed that he could just barely fit in, meaning because it was so tight and so low. And there were these bright lights that they had to turn on inside this little bed cubicle, right on the man. And this lady had to ask him questions about what was wrong with the boat under these bright lights and then she could finally fix it. But while this was going on we heard a big boom down in the lower part of the boat, and we were like, "Oh, my gosh, we have to get off." And I was wondering if I could out of the upper floor of the cabin because it was so tight, and somehow I managed to get onto the deck. And then I woke up and I was having little dreams about us being in the kitchen listening to Bryan _______.
