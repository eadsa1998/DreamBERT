I had a date with the boy to whom I am pinned. We were with two other couples which were unfamiliar to me. We were swimming in a very large pool which was open at one end. At this end the water was coming in. The water was very muddy like river water. The next thing I knew we were on our way back to the dormitory and I was two hours late. I was very worried because I knew I would be campused for the rest of the year.
