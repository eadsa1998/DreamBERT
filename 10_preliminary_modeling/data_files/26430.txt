 I'm in an expensive area that seems to be like Salt Lake City. My brother Wally lives here. The place seems to be high in elevation. I ride in a vehicle. It is a bright clear morning. I know Wally is used to driving in slippery and snowy conditions in this area, which often happens. I hear on the radio an advertisement for a buffet restaurant at which the bill for a dinner party often exceeds $1,000. I drive through a neighborhood of expensive houses. I see garbage and recycling on the curbside. I see a woman who has covered her swimming pool with a huge sheet of plastic for the winter. She is shoveling large rocks into the pool to hold the plastic in place. I'm kneeling next to a small swimming pool-like tub, a couple feet long. Another person, who I think is a woman and may be my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas, is with me. There is a sheet of plastic that covers the pool. We take small rocks, about an inch in diameter, and place them on the plastic to hold it down. The plastic covers the bottom of the pool, with rocks along the edges, and the plastic curled up around the rocks at the edges. The plastic doesn't fully cover the bottom: the walls and some bottom edges of the pool are exposed.
