Apparently (according to my friend Ralph) I have won the lottery - a special kind of lottery which is revealed on a set of playing cards. George W Bush is game master for a weird cross between top trumps and piggy-in-the-middle. My friends Ralph, Terry and Reece are playing too. I need to collect the whole pack of cards surreptitiously in order to claim my one million dollars, without George Bush interfering. The dreams drifts further and further away from feasibility.
