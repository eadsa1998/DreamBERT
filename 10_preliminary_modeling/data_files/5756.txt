[1997-06-06] One more short dream. I was on a boat, I guess I was in the Navy. I was riding on this ship and suddenly it became nothing more that a life raft , a little inner tube or something, and I was out in the ocean with some guys and we were carrying on, they were sort of tipping me to get me wet. I was thinking "This thing really holds me up well", I'm not a good swimmer by the way, but I thought this was great. I was able to navigate by kicking my feet, could get around where I wanted to and so on. At one point, I think my wife was there. I said "boy its good that you're here. I don't know where I am, if I'm in the middle of the ocean or where I am." But we swam to shore and I could hear the surf coming in, but it was very mild, no big waves or anything, just real calm and comfortable and I was just enjoying it out there. We were swimming into shore that's the last I remember.
