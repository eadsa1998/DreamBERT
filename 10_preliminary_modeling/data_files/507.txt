Two blue rattlesnakes are in the dream. One is a pet and is huge. The other is wild. They belong to the son of a woman I work with. The big one bites me a little and we kill it. I go back into the dream to do this. The bite is on my left thumb. The little one bites me for real. The boy's father sucks the poison out but his arm swells and hurts. Next we are in school and I ask the boy's mother who is in the back row to look up information in the first aid book. It keeps getting worse. I am sick. I wake up still aching and sick but don't hurt once I am awake.
