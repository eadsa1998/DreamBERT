Something about going to the home of Darlene and Dick (friends) and a woman there deceiving us. The woman takes my mother's glasses and my mother can't see. Then my mother disappears. My mother is very frail in the dream, almost like my sister-in-law who has cerebral palsy. I make the woman a deal that if I heal her scleroderma with my hands (Reiki) she will tell me where my mother is. I tell her it will be hard to love her but I must love her for this to work. I do feel pity for the woman. I begin and as I do my mother comes in the door with two people. She is her normal self and is wearing her glasses and is happy.
