 I'm in a war. On my side are people with guns. My classmates, Amy Leopard and Virginia Hamms are the voices of the people. There are red lines that we are trying to kill as they kill us. There are blue dots that we can shoot to give us extra energy and ammunition. Amy and Virginia say that they're not going to stop, they are bleeding blue blood. They say they can fight. I say no, I'm going (to do something, since I'm not bleeding). The lines move around a lot and are hard to hit. I start using bombs instead of guns.
