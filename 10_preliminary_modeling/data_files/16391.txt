I had like a really stupid dream a few days ago, and I thought it was too silly and too weird to put on this tape. I just wanted to forget about it. But today, I'm doing my research paper on dreams, and today I was reading a book and it was talking about all this stuff involved with dreams and what happens when you dream and stuff. And the only thing that was coming to me from my frame of reference was this stupid dream, so I figured there's got to be something to it, so I guess I'm going to go ahead and put it down here. I dreamt that we were in our living room. It was Mom, Dad and I think Aunt Christine and Burt were in town, and we were sitting around talking about different things. And I was sitting on the floor and everybody else was sitting on like the couch. And then it was Mom and me and some guy -- I don't know who -- and Mom had these candy-coated almond nut things that were kind of real rough and like big, and this is the bizarre part. Mom wanted me to, I think she was going to do some and she wanted me to do some. She wanted us to smooth them out and make them smaller, and the way to do it was to put them on the bed in front of us and to like lay on the bed and like self-satisfy ourselves. And I saw Mom do that with the ________s and they went from these big pecans or almonds to these small, really sweet candies. And, you know, I don't remember too much more. There had to be more though.
