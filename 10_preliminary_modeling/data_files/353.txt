I'm in a hotel sitting on a couch, waiting to meet someone. It's a young woman who wants me (and someone else - a friend, I think) to house-sit for her for a few days. She and a companion come along, we shake hands and trade polite greetings, discuss arrangements, and go on to the house. It's a big place, she's/they've got a lot of money, but it's old, the house is full of antiques and frankly is stuffed full of eccentric things and is somewhat messy. Going on through to her bedroom, we find a similar jumble (by the way, the ceilings are very high), and there are 3 very large framed "things" on the wall. They're not pictures, but more like fabric, light colored things. My friend and I figure they need to be moved - they're liable to fall down anyway. We actually start to lift one off the wall and the woman says [something that indicates we should be leaving them alone, so we quickly put it back].
