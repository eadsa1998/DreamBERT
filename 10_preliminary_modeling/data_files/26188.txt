 I go to the Quiet Cabin with my housemate Stephen Ramos. As we walk in it is like a garden, with some trees and flowers. Some of the flowers are light purple. Lori Handler doesn't recognize me. Other people are there. I talk with a woman who also works at the place. She talks to me about a book, trying to sell it to me. I'm not really interested in buying it because it's too expensive, but I listen attentively. Stephen and I go into our room. There are two sheets for the bed, which is like two double beds side by side. Something may happen with the sheets and masturbating.
