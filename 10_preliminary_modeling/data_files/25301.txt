 I'm at Brimson College, which isn't like I know it. I'm under a manhole cover near my friend Gino Teavor's house on Holy Avenue. The area under the road is entirely metal. There are several rooms with mechanical items operating in them. One room is a boiler room. My sisters Heather and Ramona and brother Wally and brother's friend Carl Rock are there. Wally and Carl argue about a location on a map. People are swimming in muddy water. There are masks for swimming. Some of these cover one's nose and eyes, while others cover just the eyes. I leave my Brimson identification card in a metal boiler room. I go to the basement of Carter Church, which is the cafeteria of the college. I think they'll let me in even though I don't have my identification. I talk to the manager. They won't let me in even if I tell them my identification number: I need to physically have the card. I go out the back door of the basement to the manhole and go down. A semi truck drives by. The rooms are all metal, and all mechanical.
