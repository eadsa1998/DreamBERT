I had three walruses and we went somewhere to get across the river to get to the other side where the place was we had to swim. Well there was crocodiles in the river so when we swam across the crocodile ate the mother and the baby. And so all I had was the father and I got bit on the finger and then we went through a tunnel and the crocodiles were chasing after us. Then I said "Hal," and they stopped and I said "get out there on that river and leave people alone." Then me and the walrus got home and I asked the walrus "where's the baby and momma," and he pointed to a direction that was back at that place where the crocodiles was and he said, "the crocodiles ate them".
