In this dream I found myself back in the Marine Corps, seated at some bar evidently pitching liberty. I was aware of a young lady seated next to me of indistinguishable age. I felt I was getting pleasantly drunk and she began to look invitingly at me when two sailors about my age approached her and proceeded to maul her. I told them to leave the lady alone whereupon they became very pugnacious. I kneed one in the groin as I had been taught and turned around just in time to see the other one wallop me with a beer bottle. I woke up at this point.
