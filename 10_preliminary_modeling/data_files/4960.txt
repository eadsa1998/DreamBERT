I'm in a bus with other people, mostly women. One woman says, "Let's go live at the Kendell." I said, "Oh, I've lived there before. I guess it would be O.K. as long as I don't have to live on the 4th floor. People who apply late usually get the 4th floor, but if there's an elevator, then it would be O.K." My friend then goes to the center of the bus and announces that I will play a song. I'm embarrassed. I get in front of everyone and need to readjust my instrument. I glue some cardboard together and cut some down to size. I use cottage cheese as a glue. I hide my work from the audience because they will have to guess the answer to the game. Then I try to play my banjo. It doesn't sound right. Finally, I notice that the cap is on incorrectly and the instrument is backwards and looks like a guitar. I look reprovingly at my friend and tell her she put the 4 on backwards for the caps. I fix it and then I can play the banjo. [BL]
