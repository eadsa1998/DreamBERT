Something of a big family gathering.  There was a bad person.  For some reason, he wanted blood from me.  So he was killing everyone off.  The one death I remember seeing was when he picked someone up by their ankles and swung them repeatedly against the doorway of the plane we were in, breaking their back.  I thought it was interesting he didn't kill them in such a way to draw blood, the way he did all the others.
