I was in my room when all of a sudden a man with a 12 foot long head jumped in, tucked me under his arm, and ran. I screamed and kicked him in the groin, and ran away screaming "Help, help!" He caught up but I tripped him and he fell into a bottomless pit. Setting: In my house and on the street. Characters: This guy who had a foot and a half long head and was really ugly. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, triumphant. I thought that this one was weird and a little scary. I felt as though it was really happening.
