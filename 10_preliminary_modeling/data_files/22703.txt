I dreamt my mother was getting married for the third time. The first two times her husbands had died. But the third time she wasn't even sure that he had died already and was getting married like that. I remember I told her, "Mother, I am going to ask you an indiscreet question -- how do you feel about having been with three different men?" She told me that the three were the same. I got upset, and it seems I was upset because she was not considering the first one, who was my father, to be special. It seems that I was disappointed in my mother. I dreamt all of this due to a movie I saw in which there were prostitutes. I don't remember any more, but it seems to me I again saw the boy I like in my dreams.
