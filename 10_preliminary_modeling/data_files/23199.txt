I was trying to keep up with some people, but I really don't remember much about that part.  The most vivid part was that I fell or had to crawl as I was leaving a building, and the ground was covered with dog excrement.  I couldn't help getting it in my mouth.  I couldn't particularly taste or smell it, thank God, but the idea of it and the mere sensation were horrible enough.  I rushed to a nearby water fountain in the hope of washing my mouth out, but there was not enough water coming from it to do a thorough job-and besides, there was more excrement on the fountain where other people had tried to do the same thing.
