 I'm in the Oak Valley Library with my friends Tim and Niles Zelling, Hank Anderson, Leon Mack, and my mom. We're going to celebrate my friend Nat Miller's birthday. There is a kid there that I know from my Personality class, who also works in the Humanities Learning Center at Brimson. He is playing a familiar song on the guitar and singing. His voice is high pitched. Tim, Niles, and my mom all join in on their own instruments. My mom is playing the violin. She is not very good at it. There is another girl who plays the violin well. I go over to the Oak Valley Rescue Squad Building to see if my brother Wally will buy us some alcohol. Wally is on the porch with some people, one of whom is a security guard. The guard is drinking a beer. I ask Wally if he can buy us some alcohol. The security guard hears me, but doesn't understand what I am asking at first. Then he does understand, and spits beer in my eye. I say to him, "Do you want to get charges pressed against you?" I walk away.
