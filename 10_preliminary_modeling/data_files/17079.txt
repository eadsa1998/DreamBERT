After our neighbors were robbed, I dreamt the robbers came back to hit our house.  There were two of them.  I confronted them in the backyard.  I took three steps closer.  They were only two yards away, about to make a break for the side gate.  One of the robbers raised his arm with the gun tilted, and fired.  I was shot just below the jaw.  I fell back and began to bleed to death, weakly trying to breath, and completely focused on the feeling.
