 I'm at an airport. I need to be on flight 117 to Boston. The flight is repeatedly delayed. Finally it takes off. I forgot about flight 771 to Chicago. I need to be on that flight after flight 117. I miss the plane. My dad calls. He leaves a message on the answering machine saying, "Go out on the dock." I feel like a total and complete idiot: a fool! I am completely discouraged. I think I've screwed up my life severely. <br/
