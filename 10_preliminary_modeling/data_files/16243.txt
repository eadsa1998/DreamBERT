Finally over with this crazy month. Last night I dreamt that we were at Clementine Springs and that we were getting ready to go swimming. And we were at the springs and I realized that I was still fully dressed and I forgot my bathing suit. So I like went back to the camp site, or I thought I was going back to the camp site to get it, but I couldn't find my way back and I came back several times to ask for directions. And then I finally realized that my time's getting short and it's really not important whether or not I had my bathing suit. So I ripped off my clothes and went in skinny dipping. And that would have been just fine if there weren't three or four rappy boys standing around with a personal CD player and stuff. But in my dream I didn't care, and just jumped in. And then I think I swam around for a little while. It was pretty shallow. And then we got out of the water and we went, we got back in the car, and then I think the kids suddenly appeared. They weren't there before, but they like suddenly appeared. And we were going to some hotel, and I was thinking how, what a shame it was that the radio got shut off and there was a really good song on. And then I had the notion that I was looking at Sound &amp; Vision in the back seat of the car. [laugh] And then I remember, as I was slowly fading into consciousness, that I had the notion that the radio on my nightstand was on and it was playing the same song. And that I didn't need to worry about it being shut off in the car. But when I actually woke up and regained full consciousness, of course, it wasn't on. It wasn't like the alarm was on and it turned on or anything. It was just in my dream, I thought it was. Well, I don't know, that was an okay dream. I keep having dreams about Clementine Springs; I wonder what that could mean.
