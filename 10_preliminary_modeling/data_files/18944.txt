A little after 4 or 5 woke up and remembered this dream. As much as I can remember, I was in the woods or a sort of jungle. I was with a girl of whom is familiar, but I can't place her. We came upon this tribe of people. They were white, with features like a North American and spoke English. There were 2 men about to be executed in this dream. There were 2 executioners, 1 man and one woman. They were familiar, but I didn't know their names. The people being executed were not familiar at all. The method of execution was sort of gruesome. First they cut one arm off then a leg, then the other arm and leg. Then they cut the body in 2 pieces lengthways (no blood or screams). While this was being done, orders were given on how to do it. All I could hear was a voice, a female's, giving instructions. The girl and I left, we were free to go and were not captives. We began to walk down the road, and behind us were the 2 executioners carrying the remains of the 2 dead. The woods along the side of the road seemed to be full of people. In the woods we then saw the 2 men that were just executed. We then found out that the 2 men that were killed were just dummies, but they were very lifelike, but no one was killed. To the girl and I, this was not a funny joke. So as we continued, we came to a bus station. This was odd because we were in the woods. So we prepared to give the bus driver money for the tickets and the dream ended.
