I was somewhere. Some people came in and kidnapped us. They put us in these meditation beds and they were in rows, like lockers. Calvin was there. They said that every hour, they were going to kill two or three of us. They killed one row. I did something that gave me the impression that they liked me. Something happened and we got out. There were lots of cockroaches. We were following them to safety. Mom had also earlier predicted a storm coming. A storm was coming. The cockroaches were all running to cages.
