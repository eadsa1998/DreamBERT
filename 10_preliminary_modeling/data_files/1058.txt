I'm in an old fashioned house, thinking I need a roommate to meet expenses. My mother and a guy come in to be roommates. I remember this guy. I don't trust him. As we prepare to lie down to sleep, I keep one eye open on him. He tweaks me a couple of times. I decide to throw him out like Muffin Cat when he's bad. I put him out on a tree limb. The guy doesn't like that. I test him. "No problem, just be invisible." He's not convinced. I decide I want a washing machine. I check the basement and see 2 of them. We comment, "How nice. Now we can get all those towels done." It's time for the guy (now Bill Cosby), to go play in a basketball game. He's nervous. I tell him not to worry. "Just stay invisible." As we're driving to the gym, the guy as a joke brings me a card that indicates a general is wanted by the police because she's moving when she has a parking permit. I laugh at the joke. We get to the gym. Bill Cosby is nervous. He needs to put his head in a wooden frame that looks like a basketball holder. Some big guy has the table with the holders on it. I tell Bill to be invisible. Bill does, and then he puts his head in a holder on another table and turns and twists around. The guy, I'm near him and watching, sees the holder thump around and his eyes get wide and he's scared. I laugh at his fear of "spooks." I watch Bill go out on the floor. I try to sneak away unseen but the announcer, an older man, sees me and calls me to the microphone. I hope my mother doesn't find out.
