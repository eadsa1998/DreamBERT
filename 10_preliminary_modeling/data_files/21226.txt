I was on the porch with someone and Ann and Pauline Hydrlica (deceased) were walking into our yard. Pauline was looking at me as she walked by. She was smiling and I noticed she must have had her nose fixed for she was not bad looking then. Again she passed me on the street and she smiled again and her smile was nice and so was her face. I was by Grandma's. They decorated their house and were varnishing the paper. I had returns on the races, but I forgot the names of the winners. A few days back I had a dream where I saw or heard the word "radio."
