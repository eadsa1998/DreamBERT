The first dream was a horror movie that we were a part of, at first.  A house, with a 4-intersection hall.  There were quite a few of us.  Any direction held death.  A few of us went to the right; we had managed to get up towards the roof, towards freedom and escape.  I went back down to find some of the others.  Across the hall was a wall of fire.  There was such destruction everywhere, it was hard to look at.  I managed to find one or two and led them back.  We had trouble climbing back up to the roof.  Some people came looking for us.  After it was over, it all HAD just been a movie.  Then my family and I were at a sort of fair with the Swenson triplets.  Their older brother Milt and two of them put on an outfit and went to the 'man's' side to dance.
