Calvin was in this big room full of quizzes and stuff I'd done. He was trying to find out who I liked (obviously, Eugene). I found this thing which had pictures of Johnny Depp, Devon Sawa, and Seann William Scott. I said it wasn't mine. Madelyn and Tucker were there. There was something about Sims 2 Seasons for the DS and it was weird.
