[1997-06-11] I was at a religious retreat, sitting in a dining room eating dinner. There were roses on the table, I smelled their fragrance. We had a thanksgiving type dinner with my favorite things, turkey, stuffing, cranberries, and my favorite kind of dessert, pumpkin pie. And it was in the middle of Spring which is most ironic.
