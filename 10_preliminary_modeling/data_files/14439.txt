I was at a school. Something was happening today that caused some people to get a fever. Oz and Giles (both from Buffy the Vampire Slayer) would be affected because they were both werewolves. It was temporary and their heart rates got too high and then they would turn. I was watching Giles. He was sweating and about to turn, so I chained him to a desk. This other person we had was chained to the wall. I got on top of this magnet block and climbed up this high cabinet. Then I was by myself. He got free and was just a big dog. It jumped about the room and tried to get at me. It got close a few times and I had to swing my legs around. He got to the door and was about to leave, but then he paused and came back to me. He wouldn't leave. Eventually, he must've because I left. I went back to Giles but there was another one coming on. We were going to the next room but we realized we had to go somewhere else. Xander and Cordelia walked past saying stuff about a big dog (they didn't know about the werewolves). We gathered everyone and ran out. This surfer dude was around and we said "Can we borrow your car?" and he said "Sure!" happily. It was an old Ute. I got in the back and Scarlett and Mariyam were there. Then there was a boy next to me and he unwrapped a lollipop. I said "that's my lollipop" and kept trying to convince him to give it. As we were leaving, someone mentioned Giles in a boat with bags, and they had put a guy with him and I said sarcastically, "yeah, don't worry about Jake Gyllenhaal or anything!". There was a big cow in the street. Dad was then in the car.
