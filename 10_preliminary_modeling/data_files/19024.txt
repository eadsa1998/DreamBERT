Prior to awakening it seemed that I was in a semi-wakened state of sleep, and that I was just thinking over and over the simplicity of one, two, three, four. I don't know exactly what I was relating to it. I don't believe anything, except just counting one, two, three, four, and along with this small dream seemed to evolve tuning in my radio which is a clock radio to a station and actually hearing music. The music was instrumental, and it was either the introduction to a song or halfway through or something, and I can recall trying to determine what tune it was. I decided that it was part of a song sung by Elvis Presley, from one of his movies, Fun in Acapulco, I believe, because it was about bull fighting. Anyway, I then heard my, then I was looking at something which I distinctly remember as being somewhere other than where I was. It was either at home, meaning Clearwater, and I was here at my apartment, or just the opposite. Anyhow, I heard my brother say, "Mike," which is my younger brother, "brought that with him." I can't distinguish whether I was home or whether I was here. I had a feeling more as if I was here, yet the setting seemed more like that at home. It's really quite difficult to decide which it was. The station that I tuned in, I recall very well because I was looking g at the radio and it was station, well, as a matter of fact, I looked at the station to see what station it was because it was only music, just instrumental and not singing. At first I thought it was 610 which is WIOD down here, and then I concluded that it was 790, which is WFUN because I had recognized a tune and knowing that a disc jockey on 790 was fond of playing Elvis Presley records and it seemed that it was 790.
