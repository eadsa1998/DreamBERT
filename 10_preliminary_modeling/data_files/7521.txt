Mary is sitting at one end of a (kitchen?) table. She has a pen or pencil in her hand and is working on what appears to be Ledger Books. She is in the process of writing something (or figuring something out) in the books. I approach her on her left side and ask what she is doing, or if I can help her. (I think my questions were of that nature.) Although Mary is smiling, she tells me she is very angry. I ask her if I am at fault -- did I cause her anger? While we are talking, Mary does not look up, keeping her concentration on the book(s) before her. She looks good -- healthy -- not sick at all.
