Trying to get out of a black gate. (Like those in China.) I was in stocking feet and walking on the garden path, felt gravel hurting my feet. Father came out and said I shouldn't go out on the street so late. "But I have to go to Silsby's to sleep so she won't be alone" but father said he'd walk over with me.
