Samantha, Sandra and Derek were in town, but for some reason things kept getting put off and delayed and scaled back and pushed back and bumped back, and nothing really got done. Then we were going to make some fancy egg salad, and we had to put these real sour things in. I sort of had the notion that they were like poison ivy, but they were okay once you cook them. So I was out there cutting these flowers and leaves from these stems that somebody had picked, and I was trying not to let the chickens get them because I knew that they were bad for the chickens. And at this point we had a buff chicken and a dark chicken. But they would jump up on the table and they would lean down and they would snatch a few pecks anyway. I dreamt that we planned to go somewhere, but we never really got there. That was kind of a dud, wasn't it? [laugh]
