I make my way into a private party. It's dark outside. Celebrities are everywhere. I want to meet Paul Newman but can't find him. I return to the party when everyone is gone and steal sunglasses they have left behind. I'm almost found out but manage to sneak away just as the owner of the house, a woman who resembles either my mother or a college professor who wanted to have an affair, returns. I'm wearing sunglasses that I have found. From a safe distance I look back to see who she is but she doesn't appear. I'm eating a bar of chocolate.
