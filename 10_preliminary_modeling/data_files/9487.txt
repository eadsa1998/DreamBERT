In Church: Father Andrew is late and misses cues; he is interrupted by fire engines: I watch fireman race to top of building: smoke rises... then I return to Church and look down to see Frank, Anastasia, Grandma &amp; Grandpa kneeling: grandma arrived in M. City looking well: shiny eyes. Father Andrew says "You don't have to kneel now, but you can kneel upstairs on wooden floor. Then I rush to get ready for the Smorgasbord. I see women setting tables.
