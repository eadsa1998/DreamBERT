Deven D and Kendall B were both there. I had an appointment to meet with Kendall B about my dissertation. When I saw Deven D I told him I was really glad to see him, that I really needed to talk to him. I started babbling about my dissertation and being stuck. He agreed to sit and talk with me. I took his hand and walked a few steps in front of him to wherever we were going to sit. I continued to talk as we walked.
