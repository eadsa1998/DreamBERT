My little brother Willie, my father and myself are playing catch with a softball in the living room of our home. The living room is quite big, so this is easily done. I'm standing near the kitchen and when my father starts talking to Willie, I sneak into the kitchen and start filling my pockets with food. I then start to go to my room, when Willie says, "You'll be sorry if you eat all that food, you'll be sleepy." Anyway, I go to my room and start eating and wake up.
