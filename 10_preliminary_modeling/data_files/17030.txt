A bizarre one: there's two characters in the dream - my friend Tim (and old friend from the past) and another unfamiliar character, who may be based on somebody from school - a berry gullible guy. Tim, who had an eccentric sense of humor, had spent weeks grooming this guy to believe in only two things in life: 1. Communicating with God via knocking on copper pipes. He had installed a long copper pipe running from this guy's rented room to his room a few floors below in the same block. He managed to persuade him that this pipe went into the earth, and that you could communicate with God by knocking on the pipe in some kind of morse code. 2. He had some other system of communicating messages in words via some kind of vouchers or pricing labels in the local supermarket. The dream gets more hazy here, and the character of Tim is replaced by my brother, who has a similar mission to string this guy along for entertainment.
