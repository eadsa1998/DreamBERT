 My housemate Norman Noman and his girlfriend Sunny Pile have been busted by the police for having sex in public places. The next day the police, their parents, and relatives gather with Norman and Sunny to confront, reprimand, and scorn them. Norman makes a caustic comment towards Sunny's mother: something about smelly feet or shoes. He seems to have contempt for Sunny's family's disapproval. These people are gathering in cars. Norman and I are with our housemate Hank Anderson in his car. Hank is driving. We speed by the people in this field-like area. There are some grassy patches, with dirt and mud. We drive through the puddles, splashing the people that have come to reprimand Norman. Hank, Norman, and I walk away. Norman walks between Hank and I. He is angry because of what has happened. Hank and I try to comfort him: to relax and calm him down, help him forget about the incident. I'm with my friend Niles Zelling and another male friend. Niles is very mad, and he throws a football very hard to release some of his anger.
