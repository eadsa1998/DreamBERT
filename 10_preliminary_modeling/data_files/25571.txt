 I'm hiking up a mountain near my cousins the King's house. My cousins Henry and Avery King may be there. Parts of the mountain are snow covered. I am then with my friend Hilary Nano, brother Wally, and classmate Beth Wilder. We are in my house, which has many stories in it and is very tall. We take the stairs up. There is a red light illuminating each staircase. We go to a window. Hilary goes out and watches the sun rise. I want to go see the sun rise too. Wally has just started a load of laundry, in which the tablecloth is included. He is gone, but returns with my friend Kevin Simpson in an elevator. My friend Norman Noman is there. I bench press 195 pounds of fruit. The barbell is covered with fruit. Others are there as I do this. I am going through a jungle with the bar. Some of the fruit kills others. As the bar goes flying through the air it loses weight. We lose weight as we go.
