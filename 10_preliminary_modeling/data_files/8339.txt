Something to do with home decorating. We were adding a wall to a room. This may have been part of or for a TV program. There were candles in the room and we were going to store a lighter near each candle, like in a drawer. But I said it was very important that we tell people how to do this safely, that they shouldn't keep lighters on papers or on fabric because they could be an additional fire hazard that way. Additional, because if candles are properly used or tended they are a fire hazard. I said it is important that the lighters be stored on a hard surface that is not easily flammable.
