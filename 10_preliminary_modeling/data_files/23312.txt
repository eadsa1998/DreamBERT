All I recollect of the first part of the night is that I walked repeatedly through a stone arched railway culvert. It was not the celebrated one at "Ame Pratts." Each time I went in below and crawled out by a vertical shaft on the other side of the track. The locality seemed to be above Westfield on the Albany. Toward morning I found myself reduced to about six inches tall and once more in an underground place. It was a cubical chamber about as big as a soap box. The walls were white and stuck over with cooked pieces of macaroni! Two circular tunnels slanted away toward the surface of the earth and through them a pinkish light streamed. I was in the burrow of a white rabbit that soon appeared. He seemed quite peaceable, but his comparatively enormous size made me uneasy. (He was, in fact, nearly two feet long.) I started out by one of the tunnels, walking backward. The rabbit followed, also backing. I pounded his flanks with my puny fists, but with no effect. Emerging from the hole, I suddenly regained my normal size, captured the rabbit and carried him off. (He was now brown.) I thought I must kill him for the laboratory, but I was very unwilling. Finally I tried to strangle him with one hand while with the other I felt his warm chest to note when his heart should stop beating. But my resolution failed and I let the poor animal revive. I carried him through Newtonville Square and came to a decaying colonial house.
