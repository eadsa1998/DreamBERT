["Where's Dad and sleeping mice."] I return from M City with Charla. I am moving my computer furniture into a bedroom. Placing it so I can see out the window comfortably. I see a pile of plastic stack boxes and look in one that has jelly belly candies in it. I see two fat little mice and think they are dead. I see one stretch so I know they are sleeping. I need to find my father. I walk out of the bedroom up one stairs to another part of this house. I enter a kitchen. Some other family lives there now. The woman has to move the stove for me to get through. Narrow passageway. I go down a hall to the living room. Lots of young adults with babies are sitting or lying on couches and opened couch beds. My father isn't there. I realize he didn't return from M City with us. I ask the people if my mail arrived. They said yes but they can't find where they put it. I am frustrated. I walk back to my bedroom only the passageway from the kitchen is now partially blocked off with a piece of plywood. I squeeze through just barely. Then I see boxes of Jello in plastic containers. One a giant sized box. I decide to buy them. I turn back and ask Jerry E. the store clerk to ring them up. Now I am walking with them and realize they are very heavy. And I wonder what flavors they are. I should have looked first. I chide myself for not thinking of that before I bought them. I am angry at myself for scooping up a bargain before thinking it through and thereby wasting my money. I always do that. Annoyed.
