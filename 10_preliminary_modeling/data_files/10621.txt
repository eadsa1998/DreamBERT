I went to Polly's house and her little brother's room was a shopping mall. So me and my Dad went to choose clothes and I found three things: 1 pair of jeans, a black and purple turtleneck, and I forget the last one. Anyways, we left them lying on the ground. (Her house looked a lot different than it is.) Her brother showed me where they were, but all he showed me was some underwear hidden in a  tennis racket. After that we went to a party. Polly could choose if she wanted to go with us or her parents. The party was elegant and everyone from school was there. We had to do a Christmas pageant, but when I went to the manager, he said I had a hearing impairment since I was three, so I didn't have to do it. Then Polly stood up for me. One of my teachers was the chef for the party.
