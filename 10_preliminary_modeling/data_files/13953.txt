I was at school in English. My desk was facing the back of the classroom, and three girls, including Josephine, some other girl I knew and this new girl who was ugly and chubby. They were talking about someone who they thought was ugly, and the way they were talking and looking at me, I figured it was me. Josephine said "and all that fat" and I looked up and they were looking at me. The new girl called me ugly and I said "look at yourself". She was like "at least I'm not as fat as you" and I said "At least I don't look like you". I got angry and so picked up her desk and pushed her back. I picked it up again and hit her with it then I left. Ezra was in a class outside and Ms Madsen was telling me to stay in after class. I said that I was going to call Mom to go home. Ezra followed me and I told him off. I was saying that "teenagers are stupid". I called Mom and she said she would come and get me.
