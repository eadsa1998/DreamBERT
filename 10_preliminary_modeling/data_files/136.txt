Thanksgiving or Christmas, going to my parents' house - I've got long hair and a hair-spray-glitter can and I use quite a lot of it - somewhere in a small town, with nice little brick buildings - somebody wants to shoot somebody else - I've just parked my car and he's parked behind me, we're at the curb immediately behind a store-sort-of building (short, flat, like a 7-11) and it looks like he's gonna go looking for the person to shoot. I believe I'll just get out of his way. [Somebody somewhere admires my hair and I tell her she can do the same thing with a can of glitter.] In my parents' house, my brother and my father are out doing something [like getting a Christmas tree] and my mom's pissed off about it.
