 I'm at Smith's Sports store in the Uptown Mall in Oak Valley. They have a muskie fishing package. It includes a big rod or two, a lot of big lures, and maybe some reels. It costs $35, which I think is not much. I look at boots and shoes. I'm fishing at in Wilmerton on Main River behind Wilmerton University. My friends Norman Noman and Hank Anderson are there. Our classmate Scott Botwright is on a big rock about 30 feet above the water fishing for muskies. Two old men are fishing from the concrete ledge farther down river. They are catching muskies. Scott, Hank, and maybe Norman jump off the big rock with their clothes on. Hank is fishing in a river using three Rapalas hooked together and a bobber. I am on a bridge with my friend Holly Lapson. Below us a plow is moving snow off railroad tracks. My friend Emerald Reinhold is below us. We spit and throw snowballs on her.
