I dreamed that my skin was absolutely covered in these awful boils. They were crusty and pussy and just everywhere. I couldn't wear anything because clothes irritated my skin too much. But I had to get to class by the time my Harry Potter tape finished. So I was rushing around trying to find a tank top to wear. When I got to school, it was like a bar. The lights were dim and there was cigarette smoke everywhere. My father and I looked at a Patagonia catalog, trying to find clothes that wouldn't bother my boils. I woke up scratching myself to try and make them go away, and was SO happy when I didn't actually have boils!
