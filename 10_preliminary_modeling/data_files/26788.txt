 I'm at Brimson walking form the building where the financial aid office is towards the student union. My friend Sara Miller passes me up while I'm walking. She facetiously says, "Thanks for writing me this summer." I'm somber, and don't reply. I'm sad, depressed, and very sullen. My friend Kate Josslyn and others have a snowball fight. At some point I tackle and tumble with my friends Hank Anderson and Norman Noman, whom I haven't seen in a long time.
