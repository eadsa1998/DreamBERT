My dream was about me and my boy friend, and we were getting married. It was at my church, and his family and my family and relatives were there. His mom was crying, and my bridesmaids were kinda too. All I know is that we were together forever, and no one can take that away from us. I was very happy and so was he, also all our family, friends, and relatives were so happy for us. We both love each other very much, and we were 23 when we did get married.
