A woman who lost lots of weight and used to be Jean is in the house with me. We have jobs to do. I think it's like Grandma Mildred's house. A man is in charge. I talk with Jean and tell her I'm amazed at how changed she is. She says she did lots of counseling. I want to ask her if she is still seeing Blake. I wonder if he got divorced, since she said they are seeing each other. I think I'm a bit envious.
