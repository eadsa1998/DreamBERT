Mom was driving me from school and she drove down an alley. She had trouble getting through this gate. Then we were at this place and I realized that we were on Casserley Ave. so I had a quick look around the corner for Eugene's house, but there was this big empty tank thing with bugs in it. There was pretty water around it though.
