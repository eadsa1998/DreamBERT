I was on the 14th floor of a building. There are dead bodies down the hall. Someone has killed them. I go toward that area to see what happened. The security guard suddenly gets up off the floor. He is the killer. I run away and he chases. I see an elevator and run down the hall for it, like in slow motion, trying as fast as I can. I barely make it and he nearly gets me as the door closes. I call 911 and yell "Help, the ____________ building on se Cascade, the 14th floor."
