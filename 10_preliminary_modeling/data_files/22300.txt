This time I remember the dream vaguely. I dreamed that a friend from the university, named Hayde (for whom I feel a great friendship in real life, but whom I disliked or felt nothing for in my dream) was my girlfriend or fianc√©e. We were in the library, right in front of the files, looking for book titles. She came close to me and treated me lovingly, hugging me and calling me "Love" and "Honey," etc., all those things that are said. But I pushed her aside, because I wanted her to leave because she was doing these things in front of other people who were in the library. I wanted her to leave, not necessarily because of what the other people would say, but because I didn't like her. The dream ended there. It was a coincidence that the next day I went to the library and met her there.
