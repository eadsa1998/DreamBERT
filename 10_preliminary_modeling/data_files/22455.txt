I dreamed something disconnected. My dream started with the sudden appearance of some nun friends and a large group of intimate and not intimate friends, as well as the presence of the professor who now teaches me logic. We were looking for a place in which to rest and after walking for a while, we discovered a very big fall which impressively fell into a small river. I was the one opposed to it and urged them to take another road, until we found something like a canyon with a beautiful house, with a lake that looked like a calm pool. From there we could see the falls. I dreamed that all of us were quickly settled in different rooms to continue during the day. We went through the house, which was full of rooms, keys on the doors, corridors that were lit but filled with mystery. Suddenly I saw that the dam had broken and that water from the falls is running wildly. Panic sets in among the people. I forced them to get on the tallest part which is a wall, their legs are hanging and the water is inches away. I remember the position of the nuns. The three nuns were sitting together and hanging on to the one in the middle, making it impossible for her to get to me. After that three girls, two boys, myself next to my best girlfriend and then a nun who is an intimate friend of my friend and then people. A white cable arrived and we were told that they were coming to rescue us. In order to celebrate, I grabbed the hand of the nun who was in between the two who wouldn't let her move and we jumped into the water, swimming and laughing happily. I don't remember any more.
