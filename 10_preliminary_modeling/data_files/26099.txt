 I'm hunting in a house. The house is like a church. My friend Jack Thigpen is there, also hunting. He yells for me to hurry over to him so we can hunt: he wants me to back him up. I hurry over to him and we hunt. He shoots and maims a chipmunk. I point my gun at it, and it squirms. I don't shoot it because Jack wants to shoot it, so I refrain from doing so while keeping the chipmunk in the sight of my handgun. The chipmunk jumps on my shin and bites me, drawing blood. I grab hold of it and pull it off my leg. I throw it against a wall, killing it. My leg is bloody. I yell for Jack or my roommate Stephen Ramos to get me some hydrogen peroxide, fast! Jack is going to call his mother, who is a nurse, to see what I should do about the bite.
