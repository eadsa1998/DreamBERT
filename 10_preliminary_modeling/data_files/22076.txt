I was at the university and they were going to raffle some furniture in class. There was a coupon to be filled out, similar to the stuff at the top of this report. Then two girls that I know came in and they wanted to take the coupon away from me (they were classmates). I reached over and grabbed the coupon, but as I grabbed it, I knocked a pair of eyeglasses that belong to a friend of mine on the floor. He picked them up and one of the lenses was missing. We searched for the lens on the floor. There were some little pieces of paper which I thought were pieces of glass, but my friend stepped on them to demonstrate they were papers. Then I found the lens and put it back in the glasses. Then a boy who studied with me in high school came into the room and we said hello briefly (he is not at the university). This surprised me because in the dream I thought he too studied at the university.
