I was doing some kind of computer work. internet work. It had something to do with directory work. There was a problem that I was trying to fix. I couldn't decide if it wasn't working because of the way I was naming it or because of where I was saving it or because of how I was saving it or if I simply didn't have the right files. I don't know.
