I was walking with a friend of mine who is a member of Phi Beta Kappa. When he was a junior, he was a member of the organization sponsored by Phi Beta Kappa for scholastically superior college juniors. In the dream, contrary to what actually happened, some member of the faculty held up his election into Phi Beta Kappa. His comment was, "at least I'm still a member of ________," the organization for juniors. I do not know where or when this conversation was supposed to have taken place.
