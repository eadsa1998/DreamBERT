We are at a gathering, like the Book Cafe or Bible study; it is my job to count the money. I separate the bills from checks and also some of the dolls' clothes that were pinned together, ready for sewing, that Marissa Camden had made while she was ill. (Note: Marissa Camden died 7/23/91) She is well now and sits next to me at a round table. She is smiling and keeps showing me how she sewed those dolls' clothes.
