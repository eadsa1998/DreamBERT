[1997-07-30] I was in a large building, it was very similar and may have even been a building on the grounds of my childhood school for the blind, where for some of my youthful years, that was my dormitory. I was there things were in quite a bit of disorder, my reason for being there, again, was a meeting that I was supposed to be attending. I left the building and outside I was walking either through melted snow or puddles of rain. I was also aware that walking around those grounds were quite a few people, there were young adults, there were children and there were even people in state politics.
