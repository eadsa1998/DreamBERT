I was at a hotel place. I don't remember why but this guy let me in to his expensive suite. There was a comfy lounge outside the room. Then people I knew were there. Ezra, Dad and some others took beds in one of the rooms. Theodore was in the other room and he was the only one in there. He took the first bed, next to the wall, closest to the door. There were about 12 beds, three rows of four across. I lay on all the beds to find the comfiest one. The only comfy one was at the other end of the row of Theodore's (next to the other wall). He made food, which was bacon and steak. It wasn't cooked properly. He said he'd put it on for longer. We had Bully and Saints Row for the Wii. I accidentally hit reset and it reset mine and Ezra's data for Bully. We had gotten really far and I was like "Nooo!". I was telling Mom about it. I went to play on the X-Box. I was playing Saints Row but told Darren it wasn't, but it was. You could play with the Wii remote and I was punching some guy on the game.
