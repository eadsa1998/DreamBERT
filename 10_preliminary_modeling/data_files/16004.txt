I can't remember where I was, possibly my house, and I was in a room with Frederick and he wanted to smoke some weed. I was preparing it and he was standing right behind me and I felt nervous about him standing so close but at the same time I was horny and wanted him to grab me, but at the last second I turned and moved and was like 'what are you doing?'. We went into another room to smoke and the blinds were open. I started feeling stoned and a parade was going by so I was trying to close the blinds. Juniper and Claudine walked past and saw us and then came in. I suddenly got angry and yelled at them to leave, screaming 'get ouy of my house!', mostly aimed at Juniper because I didn't want her killing my vibe. Frederick looked confused but shook it off.
