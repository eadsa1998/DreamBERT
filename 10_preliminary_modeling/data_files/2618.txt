I go into a classroom. I haven't been there in a long time. I sit down in my seat. I have Rover, a white cat and a rat. They take their place beside me on the left, and curl up for a nap. They are well behaved, which I'm grateful for and a little surprised. I thought they'd have forgotten, it's been so long. Now I'm the teacher and giving the lesson. As I'm merrily teaching, enjoying it, I am told by several people to cool out. The students are ready to do their own lessons now and, in fact, need the practice. It is best for me to step aside now and let the natural order of things go on. I don't want to stop, but realize it is best, and I go sit back in my seat. Rover is acting up and running around.
