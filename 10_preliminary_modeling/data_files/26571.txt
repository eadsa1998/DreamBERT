 There is a garage sale occurring at home in Oak Valley on the front lawn. I'm in charge of running the sale. I scramble around, getting things setup. I notice two women are having garage sales of their own on the sidewalk in front of our yard. At first I think hostilely towards them, but then realize they were invited to be there by my mom. They may bring more business to our sale.
