 I'm driving a semi-truck. I'm driving a group of young adults, my age, on a fairly long trip. I pull the truck into a gas station in a small town. I'm not really sure where to park, so I just stop next to another truck. People go into the shop to get a break from the driving. The truck starts to slide sideways. I'm outside the cab on the ground. I try to control the slide. It bumps and smashes into the semi-truck next to it, and then bounces back, sliding into the gas pumps on the other side of the truck. I realize I haven't set the parking brake on the truck. I put the parking brake on. The truck then stops sliding. It then slides a bit more. I look at the front tires and see that they're over some hatch-like vents that have popped up, or are up, off of the ground. The truck slides down these hatches about 12 inches. When the truck wheels hit the ground at the bottom of the hatches, I think it is finally stable: it won't slide. The others come out from the store. I don't think anyone has seen the fiasco. I'm especially thinking if the owners of the gas station have seen it, since the truck hit their gas pumps. My housemate Stephen Ramos is among the people there. I have been driving the whole time. Stephen says he would take a turn. I say no, I'll keep driving. I am sore and stiff, but we haven't been driving that long: four to eight hours. I keep driving.
