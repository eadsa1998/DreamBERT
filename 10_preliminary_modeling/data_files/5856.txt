I am sitting at a table with several albums of stamps which I have taken out of the UN Postal Administration and from my safety deposit box. There is another guy at table (a stranger) and he too is looking thru his albums and talking aloud, His talking annoys me. And then as look thru my album, I am more annoyed at noting certain stamps are gone, others cut out from page. On the first pages I only noted some perforations bent and thought this was my carelessness in handling the book. Then seeing some gone and later see that these are all the most valuable, I am incensed. Rush home to phone Bob Max (Chief of UN Postal Admin.). I can't find phone book, but eventually get thru, and start to tell him what happened. He, however, is calm and not excited and this annoys me. We are cut off and then I hear children's voices on wire. I say, "Some damn brat cut us off!" Then I regret saying this because it was probably Max's kid and maybe they heard me. His wife comes on and tells me BOB IS NOT THERE, BUT AT THE UN. I am quite puzzled by this since I was talking to him. I then tell her that I am disgusted and will no longer collect stamps and will resign from all the clubs.
