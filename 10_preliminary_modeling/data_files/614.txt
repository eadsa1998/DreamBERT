A local banker and his family are babysitting our kids after school. My mother, husband and everyone is disgusted with me. I am talking to my mother on the phone and I am disconnected as my sister-in-law comes in the door. Then I am reconnected and all is okay. My youngest daughter is doing most of the work. I finally get home. She is taking care of the banker's youngest daughter who is a year old. My daughter is worn out. We walk up the hill in my hometown. There are red and yellow roses free for the taking lined along the side of the road and there are also some flowers for sale. I pick the free ones. My daughter is up ahead, trying to keep up with the baby. The baby almost gets hit. This causes an accident and the car rolls over into my aunt and uncle's yard. I tell my uncle. My daughter lies down and I have to do mouth to mouth on her because she is worn out and is dying. I revive her and decide I have to stop working.
