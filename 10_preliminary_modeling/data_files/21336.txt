We were at a picnic like. Johnnie was supposed to be fighting with a chimp. There were fights there with bulls. I didn't see them. I was looking for fighting or blessed bulbs in the entries. There was a lot of debris around. I just passed it up and the people expected everybody to pitch in and clean up. I intimated my sister Mary and was going to intimate sister Ann, but there was someone in the room and we were aware of it. I was in PA. I saw George Gtoch (duke) walk by. He looked young.
