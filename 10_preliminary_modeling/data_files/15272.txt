I went driving after midnight, going 90km/h on a 50km/h road. I slowed down because I was out so late as well as speeding. I got to a house which was like an apartment. I parked my car and could hear sirens and I called out "Ryan!" and Ryan Kwanten and Rutina Wesley were on the balcony and he called back to me. I said we had to go -- the cops were coming for him. He came down but the police got there and I tried to drive off, but couldn't. They asked where Ryan was and I said I didn't know where he lived and they eventually let me go.
