I was in a hotel. I was trying to use the in-house phones to call for someone to help me with my luggage as I was checking out. I tried several different ones. There were square, green, signs on the walls about 12 in by 12 inches in size. I don't remember exactly what they said but some of them said extension 205 and some said extension 209 for services that I thought might be able to help me, but I wasn't clear which one I should be calling. I think I finally realized that 205 was the correct one however I wasn't being successful in reaching anyone. I am using one of the phones that is close to the corner of a wall where I can see the area on the wall running perpendicular to the right of where I was standing. At the end of that wall was the registration desk. There is a man and a woman behind the desk. The woman is also on an in-house phone. She sees me and holds the phone away from her ear and looks at me and shakes her head no. I hang up the phone and walk over to her. She tells me that this is not a public phone. That made me kind of angry that she would think I didn't know that. I thought about explaining to her what I needed but decided against it.
