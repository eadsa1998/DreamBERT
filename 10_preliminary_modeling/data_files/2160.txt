Robin Williams is going away, so I call him over to give him a goodbye kiss. I give him my long, lingering, best sexy kiss and he moans softly as he melts into it. I smile at his pleasure. He starts to walk across the street and then gets on all fours to imitate a baby crawling. He's in diapers. It's a little cute comedy skit to amaze me. I laugh. Then bunches of kids do it too and several of the littlest are not looking out for traffic as they romp across the street. I see cars coming, so I stand up, walking out in the street with my hand up to stop traffic.
