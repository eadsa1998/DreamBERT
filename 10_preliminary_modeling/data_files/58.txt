Having a meeting or class at my apartment - Brad Brown is here. (Not this apartment.) Very informal. As we get ready to break up everybody talks about who's going with whom. The young man I came with seems to be dubious about us going together but says ok, and I talk to some other people on the "porch" outside (all concrete or stone, including steps and side wall, no rail). Then I realize that since he drove me here why would I go with him? So I tell him it's ok, go on without me.
