Paulina seems remote and not emotionally connected. Then her older sister (maybe Ellie) cries and asks Paulina to forgive her for setting her up to be so remote. They hug and Paulina is now emotionally freer. She and I hug warmly. Now she wants me to come to her home in another state. I say, oh, I'd rather not. I don't like the mountains, the high altitude," but I relent and say, "B ut if you're going to insist and live there, I'll have to breakdown and learn to live with rarified air." Now we're in her car, she's driving and we're going over the mountains. She shows me huge mountains and snow slopes. We marvel that even on the hottest day of summer, there is still snow. Then it starts snowing and Paulina is concerned. The driving is going to be dangerous and slick so she prepares to be alert. She says to me, "Don't make any of your silly noises, ok?" She's asking me not to suddenly do any of my comedic stuff that might startle her and break her concentration. She's being polite. I assure her I'll be good. I tell her to relax. I trust she'll do well. We drive through the falling snow and suddenly it's all gone and the summer day is beautiful. I am so taken by the beauty, I ask Paulina to pull up so I can take pictures. She pulls up, turns the car around and I get out with my camera. The large purple flowers are wonderful and I try to use my close-up lens, but somehow what I see alludes the auto focus camera eye and only "ordinary" stuff gets focused. I'm disappointed and look around for a better subject and am very drawn to the beauty of the moment - the mountains, the flowers and a huge wide river that I realize is actually the highway we are driving on.
