I was walking along a road or street somewhere when I came upon a book which had apparently been thrown out of a car which had just passed.  It was entitled Step Four.  A little bit farther, I came upon one entitled Step Two.  I wondered what happened to Steps One and Three.  A little bit farther I came upon a bunch of tables which were set up for a church supper.  Marvin Martinalle was there.  I felt a little embarrassed talking to him, since we hadn't been to church in so long.  He commented on the books I had, and I told him I had been looking for Teilhard de Chardin.
