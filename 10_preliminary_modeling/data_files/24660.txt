Me and my mom and a couple of my friends were driving up to Yosemite for winter vacation. On the way we stopped at Wendy's to get something to eat (somebody took our order). When we were back on the road all of us except for my mom did homework. We had to drive over a lot of different bridges. When we drove over the last bridge, we heard crumbling. Me, my mom and my four friends looked under us. The bridge was crumbling and falling into the rushing river. We fell into the river 10 seconds later. Setting: In our car on the road. In Wendys-fast food. In Yosemite. Characters: My mom, Lisa, Sandy, Helen and Marisa. I don't know who the person was who took our order at Wendy's. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, scared. When we were not driving on the bridges, I was happy, but when the bridge started crumbling under us I was scared.
