I was in the haunted woods and there was this crazy dude who killed some people on the 4-wheeler. I got on the 4-wheeler and drove away from him. He died. I was at school and in class with Jake, Chriss and Silas and we all had tapes. They put theirs on and they all had the same songs. I put mine and on and it played "The Birds and the Bees" and they were ok and first, until he started singing and they chucked a spaz because it was old. The voice was old sounding.
