I dreamed that I had just become engaged or married and that I was standing on Chester and Euclid waiting to cross the street. The light was red, so I couldn't cross the street because of the automobiles. I leaned against a telephone pole, picked a splinter from it and thought, "Well, what difference does it make to be stopped for one light, when there is a whole life ahead?" Next I seemed to be watching a play, Kiss Me Kate, but there was no audience that I could see. Kate and Petrucio were singing a song about dancing up and down. I thought that was as good a way to symbolize it as any. Then Petrucio said that he had practiced that afternoon with his secretary. Kate pretended to be shocked, but I knew she really wasn't.
