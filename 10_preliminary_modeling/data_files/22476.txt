I was with my mother, my sister and a cousin at a store that I know where they sell art stuff. There were many clocks, porcelain things and materials, the show windows were filled with many things. I was picking out a card holder and loved one that was shaped like a broken shoe. I asked the salesman to show it to me, but he showed me another one, shaped like a pitcher, in light blue. I didn't want it. The guy who waited on us in the store was rather nice; he was the owner and was with an older lady whom I know. They were waiting on me when all the clocks rang, that is the alarm bells rang; as soon as some stopped, the others started. We were talking about what my sister and my cousin (F) had done because they had been the ones with the jokes. Suddenly, I was in Arenales looking at an apartment building. The boy from the store was there with his mother. He was good-looking and was dressed entirely in white. His mother was all in black, had short hair and was around 60. We got in a green station wagon. The boy was commenting about the joke in the afternoon, they had liked my sister doing that. He told me that I was the type that gets good grades and that I wouldn't dare to do that; he planned to court my sister and I felt angry, I would have liked to say that I had also taken part in that and to tell him that my sister was going to get married.
