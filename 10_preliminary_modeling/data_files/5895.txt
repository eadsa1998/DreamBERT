I am driving someplace and looking for a certain road. I see one at the left with a house on the corner. Am not certain it is really a road or just someone's driveway, although it is rather wide for a driveway. It is black asphalted and I stop the car just after the turn, undecided whether to go ahead or not. The road disappears into the trees and a short distance ahead a man is standing square in the middle of the road and looking ahead at me. I sit in the car and wait and he stands and watches. No action. Finally he moves a few steps aside and I drive ahead. As I pass him, note he is middle-aged, heavy-set. I drive on and on and finally into an open area. To the left the view is magnificent of a bridge in the distance and a bright blue harbor. Later I am on a boat in that harbor steering it thru the water and appear to be very high up in the boat. Have a good view of rocks and shoals as the boat is steered by me along the coastline for some distance. The water is a deep, rich and clear blue and I remark on how much fun it is to steer the boat so easily thru the water.
