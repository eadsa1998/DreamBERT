I'm outdoors and I see this guy and we get to talking and flirting. I kind of like him and as we are chatting, I lie down on a picnic table like thing and we're hugging and talking and then I feel the top of his penis inside and I'm surprised. I pull away and he is disappointed; it took him some work to get that far out there in public, all of us fully dressed. I apologize and we decide to go on upstairs to my room. I had thought we were going to go downtown and have fun, but I shrug. After all, it's pretty obvious he wants sex and it could be fun and we can go out together later. So I agree and we go upstairs. I think, "This is kind of neat because this guy is Peter Sellers and now that we're being intimate and having fun, he'll be interested in a playscript I'll write especially for him and then I'll become rich and famous, just like a dream coming true." Now we're in a room and both are naked. He's lying in bed under the sheets and he looks different. He has long curly hair like Arlo Guthrie. I'm standing up, pacing at the foot of the bed, on the bed. Before we got to the room, I remember thinking, "I'm glad he's overweight because then he won't be turned off by my droopy 47-year-old body."
