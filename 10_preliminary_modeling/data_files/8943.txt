Going to the university. I was riding in the front passenger seat of a car. The driver was someone I knew. At first it feels that I am just along for the ride but later that doesn't seem to be so. We had directions to the place we are going, which at first seems like someone's home. The driver had read the directions and then given them to me to help us find where we are going. We are driving in the country. We come to the end of one road and we have to turn left or right. The driver confirms that we want to turn left and I say yes. The driver also says something about the road being 35. I see the road sign and confirm that it is 35. Now we are at the site and it seems more like a public place, maybe a university. We are outside and we are helping other people get ready for an event. Someone important is going to be arriving soon. The perimeter of the space where we are preparing for this event is lined with plants and flowers. Some of the flowers are in hanging baskets. I am working with a woman whom I have not met before. We are dead-heading the flowers so they look especially nice for the event. The event is something very important. Someone important is going to be attending. As the woman and I are working on the flowers we're talking about this person and the event and talking about how someone else who is attending will be learning what to do or how to behave when he is in the same or a similar position as this important visitor. It seems like it may have been the president of the college.
