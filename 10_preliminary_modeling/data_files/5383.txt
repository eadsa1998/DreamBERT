I had a dream that Anthony and I were sleeping together. I played soccer with Althea and Hester and scored a goal. Then I was in the library with Anthony, and I was really sad because his graduation was the next day. I began to cry as he sang to me. Lydia tried to comfort me. Julian was there too. Anthony found some statistic in a book that said that only 6% of teenagers ever had sex, and I thought that was probably wrong.
