Samantha and Sandra and Derek were coming for my graduation, and they were going to be here in like a few days. And I was in the house and I think Derek was already here, and we were going to turn on the air conditioner for him so he wouldn't be hot. And this evangelist girl, kind of like a Spanish descent, real nice and real sweet, was in Mom's work room talking to this black street kid who was like, the black kid was like this big momma, like Missy Elliot just sitting there, and she was so mean and so harsh that the evangelist girl was trying to convert her and make her softer, but it didn't work. So they both ran out of the house, and then I remembered I was going to the Dome, and so I got there and I didn't know whose equipment was going to be set up or when, and I went up the stairs, and, of course, Dad was like following me the whole time. For some reason the gates were locked and we had to get somebody to open them up and let us in. And we went up the stairs and, to my relief, the guys were there setting up their equipment, and I had my cane for whatever reason, and I actually like bumped into a pole. [laugh] So they set up the equipment -- the board and the CD players -- and they connected one of the CD players by way of RCA connectors, but they left the other one undone for who knows what reason. And I was trying to connect it, but for some reason I had the notion that the RCA connectors would carry all the power from like the power mixer. And so Dad was like, "You don't have to turn the power off," but I didn't want to touch the actual receptacle. It was like I was trying to connect the speaker jacks while the unit was on, but it wasn't; it was just the line level, but I thought that it wasn't, so I was real, real cautious. And the RCA jacks weren't these like regular RCA's. They were like flat things that you have to slide into p_____. It was weird, and soon after I woke up.
