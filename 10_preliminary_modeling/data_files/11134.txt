I dreamt I was swimming on a beach and it started to rain real hard as a few friends of mine and I ran underneath an umbrella on the beach. One of the girls ran for help because the water was beginning to rise. She came back with a sorority sister of mine on a horse. The horse was very wild and wanted to throw her off. After she came, others arrived on horses. Then the dream faded away.
