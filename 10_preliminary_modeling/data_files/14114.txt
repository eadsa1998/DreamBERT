I was at school. I thought it was home time and went to walk out, but then Lorelei sat down on the path outside the front of the office and started eating. It was only 11am. I wondered why we were here since we had finished and so I called Mom to get me. She was hesitant but I was like "We graduated!" so she came. I was waiting with Lorelei. She gave me this little white thing as a graduation present. As I walked to Mom's car, I looked back and saw Darius, Eugene and lots of other people there. When I got in the car I commented on this to Mom.
