Last scene of this dream I was with Ceil ________ and we were recalling how we both derived so much from a particular writer that we had both read, although at the time we were engaged in collecting rocks. There was a particular location that seemed to be our favorite. I can't remember it right now. The gist of the statement seemed to be something like working towards some kind of a goal is a virtue. He and I in this scene were standing together in seemingly suspended in space surrounded by doctors and yet we were ____________ from the rest of the background. We were wearing something that vaguely resembled a rather designless place, but very, very small, more like a one piece bathing suit covering us up to our necks. It looks like the older ones used to. The only 2 colors seen were myself and the other boy surrounded by a very dark brown background. Day residue: This seems derived in part from the discussions I have had about a speech made by Goldwater remarking upon virtue and vice. I get the distinct feeling that I dreamed this dream twice.
