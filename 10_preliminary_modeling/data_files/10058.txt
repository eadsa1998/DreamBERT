Frank is back home but wishes to take some books to a person he hardly knows. I get angry and try to hold him to stay with me; he stays on reluctantly. Then we go to a BEACH and see a volley ball game and a young woman runs up and tries to embrace him; he frees himself from her embrace and is embarrassed. Later one of Zena's friends (Polly H.) comes to stay with us and I make room for her food in our refrigerator.
