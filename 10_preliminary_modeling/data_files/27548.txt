In my dream I was in the lobby of a hotel which I had stayed at in M -- B--, F--. I was just sitting there wondering how I had got there. Then people who had been staying at the hotel last winter when I was there came in and each one greeted me and asked when I had got there. I answered that I didn't know when or how I had gotten there. They didn't answer, but just walked away. I was left sitting there along wondering how I had got there. That is all I can remember of the dream.
