I. and I went swimming. I had never been to this wild, deserted lake. She left after a few minutes, saying she would come back. She never did; I swam - kept busy- G. finally appeared - and took me back. (G. is the type person you cultivate because he sustains your pride-ego-self satisfaction. He convinces me I'm wonderful. I haven't seen him for a while - 90 he came in a dream &amp; said the same things).
