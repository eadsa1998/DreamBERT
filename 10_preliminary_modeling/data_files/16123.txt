We were having a chorus rehearsal and everybody was sitting in the aisle of the little theater. And they wanted everybody to sit down and turn a certain way, but we were all in the aisle. And we started singing, "Deck the halls with boughs of holly, fa la la la la la la la la." And then we started going faster and faster, and I thought to myself how the words were tripping over each other, and how it got to be tongue twister when we started going faster and faster. And we got to, "Fa la la, la la la, la la la," I had to go into my own octave, and that happened to be when Mrs. Dougherty was standing right next to me. And I kind of went up a little bit too high, I think. And then suddenly her and I were walking in the park together, like Mom and I do, and she started running and I held onto her one arm with both of my hands and we ran together. She said, "This is good exercise." And then she, with her other arm, puts her other around me and starts spinning us around and around and around, and then we start just walking again and she yells something, something like, "Didn't That feel good?" and I say, "Easy, won't that hurt your voice?" And she didn't answer. So we kept walking and before we knew it, we were home. And I told her I had to, it happened to be when Mom and Dad were home, and I told her I had to vacuum up some bird seed on the porch. And she said, "Well, let me run home and get my car, and I'll vacuum for you." And I said, "No, you don't have to." And she said she would vacuum for me. And then I got home and Mom was there, and then I called her and left a message that Mom was already here. I don't remember what happened after that.
