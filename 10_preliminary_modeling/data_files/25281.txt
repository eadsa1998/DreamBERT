 I'm at Carter Church. There is some kind of a banquet or reception about to take place. I'm early. One banquet just got over. People are still preparing for the second one. I'm underdressed, but it doesn't rally bother me. I have on a white shirt and no tie. Most other people are wearing ties. Someone tells me there are some gold headed bald eagles right near there. I go out to see. There are three wild turkeys. <br/
