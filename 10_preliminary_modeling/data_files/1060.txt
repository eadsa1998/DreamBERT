A play. Stan has asked me to recreate my role. "This time play it for real, and use a more realistic voice." I don't like playing an older, mature woman. I'm amazed that Stan wants me in his play. In the play, I see two guys that love each other. One guy has golden curls and he's called "Betty girl".
