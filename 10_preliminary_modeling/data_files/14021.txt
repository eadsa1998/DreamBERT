Mom and I were at this house, as she wanted to buy it. It was big and they said it was an Asian design. The front of it looked symmetrical, with two rounded sides with a pointy roof on each and a flat roof in the middle. I was looking at the bedrooms and they all had a double bed in them. There were two master bedrooms and two normal ones. One of the normal rooms had a bathroom next to it and I wanted it. The other one was bigger so I hoped Ezra would take it. We went out the back and it had a huge backyard. We were in the middle of a garden. I joked that we would need the scooter thing that Poppers has to get around it. He was also there a while away from us.
