I am putting forms on tractor feed into a machine. It's all set to go and I turn it on. It goes fast, spitting out the paper. It won't stop. So I turn if off. It won't stop, so I unplug it. It still won't stop. I look closely and see another wire attached to the wall socket. I'm afraid to undo it, because I'll get hurt. I finally pull it from the wall. The machine stops. Then the room changes. Long halls grow out, covered with parquet wood design. The Queen of Hearts is coming. I must run. As I run down the hall, I notice I'm wearing sexy black stage entertainer clothes. I see a stage, with musicians there. I go out on stage, to the mike. I remember that Lydia and Ellie, Dovre and Paulina had come here too. I start to talk to the audience who are far away seated at tables. I say, "Everyone get up and go to the dance floor." Most do. I say, "Your only excuse is if you're dead, and I don't mean dead drunk!" They laugh. I turn to the musicians, "Hit it boys, some hot boogie." They play (piano, drums, bass, etc.) Boogie, I start singing and it's good. Ellie and another woman join in, 3 part harmony. It's great. Audience loves it, I love it, except I want to do it solo. I tell Ellie and other woman to go away and I sing ballad. It's great.
