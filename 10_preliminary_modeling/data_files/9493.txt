Trip with Father Andrew and Frank and friends and people from Church; see Nevena and Marissa get ready; then At Father Andrew's house notice a violin stand and music and a Bible: I say to Phil (Jonathan's friend) "Father Andrew also plays the violin." Then somehow Frank and his friends "get lost;" later see them again in open car, laughing. I look for children in big building near the sea; they are lost, crying. I go swimming with them -- in the water, I see shimmering and reflection of sun in the water -- a metal sphere with small metal pieces... show it to Wendy; then suddenly the sun disappears and it is dark: I hear Father Andrew give a lecture in French. I go upstairs...
