I see Fr. Zachary in his office, peering intently at an icon and meditating on it. (he looks like Zarastro in the Magic Flute) I wait for a friend to join me. It is hot in the office, so I turn up the A-C, then I watch my friend run down the corridor and return to the office. Fr. Zachary has left. I go to peer at the icon and see that it is of the Publican and Pharisee, the topic of Fr. Zachary's sermon on Sunday. (tomorrow) (wake with a + feeling)
