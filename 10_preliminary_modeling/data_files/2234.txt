Howard is married to another woman and the three of us are walking. I'm in the middle. I tell her, "After all, I've know Howard since we were kids. I transferred to M City High in the sophomore year and he transferred in his junior year." He says, "No, in the 8th grade." I say, "At any rate, I only knew you from the sophomore year."
