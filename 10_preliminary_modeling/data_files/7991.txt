I had just gotten a new dog. It was full-grown yet very small, maybe 4-5 pounds max. It was white. Perhaps a poodle. I called it Inga. When Matthew asked me how I arrived at that name I said in go the information and out come the knowledge. In go. Inga. Matthew and I were in bed asleep. I reached for Inga and she wasn't there. I wondered if I had just dreamt her or if I really had this dog. I got up and walked around the house looking for her. At this point I was in my birth home
