I dreamed I had to go on a long ocean voyage and I was in uniform of some branch of the military forces. Seats were assigned and I found my seat was on a small platform on the lower part of the vessel almost at water level. The platform was only protected from the elements by an iron railing, and the waves kept flooding the floor. When I asked why I was assigned to this seat, the ship's officer replied that I was classified a "masculine personnel" and must keep that seat during the whole voyage. The next thing I remember is talking to some other people seated at the same place and regretting I'd forgotten my knitting. Then all of a sudden I was in a dance hall, still on the ship, and dancing with many different fellows who kept cutting in on each other.
