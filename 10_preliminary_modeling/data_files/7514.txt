Mary and I are standing in what seems to be a kitchen. We are facing each other and arguing. I am not sure what the argument is about, but think it concerns her illness. Mary is extremely angry. She shouts and gesticulates. She accuses me of constantly reminding her that she is ill and wants me to stop it. I face her and am speechless. At the height of her anger, Mary picks something up and throws it at me. It is a large ham or roast.
