I was at school and I made my own computer. There was a little tube thing I used. Then we had to go into groups. Cheyenne and Jocelyn went to go in one group. Derrick got this guy to chase me because I embarrassed him or something. When school finished I went to this place where I had got a mouse from to ask if they were special. The girl was pale and fat and ugly. We also went through a drive thru and the girl serving us had braces and she was hard to understand. Then 'today' we didn't go to school.
