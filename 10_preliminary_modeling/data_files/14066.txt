There were zombies. I was with Eugene. I've forgotten most of it, but we were at a house and a few zombies came. There were two people there too. We kept moving between some spaces and zombies would come down the hall and Eugene would kill them. At the back of the house, was a cliff thing made of sand. There was sand down the wall of the house too, and when we threw sand on it, it would react with a spark. We climbed down the cliff, but Eugene and I had to go back. He got to the top first and he grabbed my hand and pulled me up. There were zombies down below and we were throwing sand onto the sand to get them. Some got to this guy (one of the people in the house) and he died. We heard motorbikes and Eugene told me to move stuff around to look messy (to make it look like we had taken over the house). Then Nathan and Haley (both One Tree Hill) were at a school and people were bothering them. Peyton was wearing a mask which was spotty and gross. There was a theatre. A long time later we had a baby. Babies were required to dance in a cot, but we hid her. There was a map of the school. We were trying to work out who was going to 'work' and who was going to stay home with the baby. Then it was Andy and someone's baby. There was a gate, and the baby was behind it. They were trying to trick each other into who was going to stay with the baby. I was watching some bloopers from shows. One was a lady who said "intelligents". Another had two guys sitting on chairs and in the middle of a joke they both fell off at the same time and died. Some science fiction show had 8 episodes that crossed over with Red Dwarf. Lister and Rimmer were the only two I recognized. I was trying to talk like Craig Charles by saying "Dave Lister" and emphasizing the "er".
