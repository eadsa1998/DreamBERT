Meet handsome man, gray at temples, at a resort on a Sunday at an improvised Greek Orthodox service. He puts his arm around my shoulder "How old are you?" "32" he says. "You can have yourself a man for the summer, but then I must marry an Austrian." "I am Austrian too" I say. "I have been married, but I am free on Sundays." We walk home together; he is very excited; we go to bed right away; have good sex; at the end I go to the bathroom for douche; almost too matter-of-fact. I think to myself "With Frank I have good sex too." "What I want is companionship."
