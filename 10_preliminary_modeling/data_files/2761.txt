I am at a beach with two other women and they point out Merle in his wheelchair and ask if he's tried to date me yet because he's been hitting on them. I feel sadness. I say, "Yes, he has, but, you know, I'm just not interested." I walk down a boardwalk to the beach, and somehow skin my knee. A lifeguard with white blonde hair puts a bandage around it and around my wrist. It is too loose and will come off so Michael has some tape and we are taping the gauze bandage down more tightly. Now I'm ready to play. The lifeguard watches me. My observer point of view is right behind his head. He watches and then walks toward me. Now the point of view is with me and I see a big dog approaching me. He/the lifeguard lays down next to me. I pet him and start to lay one leg up over his back and then change my mind because it could be considered sexual. The dog/lifeguard is intense.
