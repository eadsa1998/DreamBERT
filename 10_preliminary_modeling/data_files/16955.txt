I turn up at a party. The venue is large and open-air like a hillside croft containing a fenced off stream. In the stream are big fat fish - salmon perhaps. They are enormously fat. There's an abundance of them, and apparently we can catch them for food. There are several guests arriving, so I catch several and line them up for later. Worryingly, after catching about 15, they seem to run out - I can't see any more coming down the stream. The 'venue' is actually sheltered - perhaps by a marquee. It's warm even though it's night. My eldest daughter is there too. Perhaps it's a wedding party. There are a few other children there, one little girl the same age as my daughter. They go running off together to play. Stupidly I assume they'll be safe, but after about an hour I realize I haven't seen her. A search takes place which gets frantic for a few minutes until eventually I find them under a suspended blanket - they'd made a camp where they'd laid out 2 little beds.
