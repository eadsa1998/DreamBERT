I was in this camp where they watched everything you did. They had a pool with tons of stairs all over the place. When you ate you had to stand in line while they regulated how much food you got. Then they had guards that made sure you didn't take any food with you when you left the cafe. If you did you would be penalized. (I don't know how.) That's all I can remember.
