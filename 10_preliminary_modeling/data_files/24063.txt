I'm in a really crowded party in a dark little beach house. I can't recognize anyone, and the house is laid out like a million little party houses I've seen in my life. All of the sudden I'm in my car in the driver's seat, leaned back so I'm almost laying down. My car is parked at the beginning of the Wharf right by the Beach. I look outside my window and I see three girls and they're being loud, and it looks like they've been going from party to party. They see me in my car and now they're in the car with me. The one on the right is the biggest and she has blond hair. The one on the left is the tallest and blond, and the one in the middle is hottest with brown hair. They're asking me questions and talking to each other, but I'm not doing a very good job at making out what they are saying. One asks, "What are you going to do right now?" and I say, "I don't know, but I can give you directions to the party I was just at." They all say, "No, no, we don't want to go." There is an awkward pause and the middle one says, "C'mon," and then comes in to kiss me, along with the other 2 girls. We all kiss and when it's over, the girls were like, "Okay, bye," and open the car door and leave. I'm by myself and then wake up.
