I am at my parents' house and I see my father and his father working on fixing the back door. The entire frame around the door is loose and needs to be fastened back up. I see my grandfather holding everthing up -- door, surrounding molding, and even a little of the wall -- while my father is doing some sort of fastening. I say, "Let me help", and I assist in holding up the door and surrounding material. I overhear my grandfather telling my father about his father (my great grandfather), "When he was very old he would get out of the house and go for walks. We nailed the door shut but he would get out anyway and trample over three rows of flowers in the garden. We would find him just walking aimlessly around the neighborhood. He always said he just had to get outside." Now I look at my father and he looks older than I have ever remembered him being and I start to confuse him with my grandfather. I have trouble distinguishing the two of them and I try very hard to figure out which one is which.
