I am on a train track and running from the Nazis and I rest for a second. Someone says, "Take a bath now because when the war is nearly over you won't have time." So I take a wonderful hot bath and then hear the Nazi train coming and get out quickly to dry off and change into clean clothes. My family runs for cover and I run down the sidewalk, trying to get to the border where the Dutch can help me. He (the huge German guard) yells, "Halt," and I run. I pour a cream-based jelly out of a tube into his eyes as my defense. He tries to shoot me. I run. I make it to the intersection and try to cross. A Dutch person comes across and helps me across. The German follows and I nearly empty the tube in his eyes and kick at his groin and trip him. He falls and I yell, "Get me a gun." I meant to kill him. The Dutch laughs nervously, surely she doesn't mean to use it. Some wise person says gently, "Get her the gun. She won't kill, but needs to make the effort of holding him at gunpoint for her dignity."
