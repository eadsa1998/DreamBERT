This was something about SDI. There was a number of us involved in a discussion, sitting in a circle as we do in small group. My parents were there and I had been sharing something and Mother looked at Sister Rachel and asked if it would be okay if she asked a question of me. Sister Rachel and I answered simultaneously however I said no and she said yes. As soon as I heard her say yes I became very upset because she had promised me before they joined us that they would not be allowed to ask questions or give input. I was feeling very upset by that. There was another part of the dream where we were working on some kind of activity or exercise. We had these books, three of them seemed to be art related books. The other three I don't know what they were. I don't know what we were doing with them. It looked like we were now in a kind of cafeteria or classroom. The tables were the typical six foot rectangular tables with two chairs at each one. We were working at those tables. My classmate Rachel I was there.
