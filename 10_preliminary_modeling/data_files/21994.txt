I had a car that had a visible roof or top. It was like glass and I could see thru it. I walked to the corner and when I got back to where I parked my car, it was gone. Someone drove it off. I was on my way to work and was sort of puzzled what car I was to take to work in Broadway, Ohio. As I was waiting on a side street, I saw some cows walking down the street. Then behind the cows there was a bull. I don't know how he saw me, but the bull came right for me, charging. I jumped up on a freight car and the bull was after me. I then jumped very easily and flew a little in flight from the bull and he couldn't get at me. I saw pictures or movies of people when they were young and then old. You could recognize them very clearly.
