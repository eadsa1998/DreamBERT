I was somewhere, I can't say where exactly. There was a guy announcing things for football players and I noticed him; it was John Evans. Then I looked and it was really Don Evans. My heart sunk. I hadn't seen him in about a year and what a night that was. The next thing I knew I was roller blading back into a locker room. It was a very nice locker room, but it was co-ed. I was getting dressed into a lime green mini skirt and a tight half top. It didn't look like my body. I was beautiful and better endowed on the top. After I slipped my top on, I looked to the right and he, Don, was standing there. I asked him softly to stay and wait for me. He said absolutely. I put on my shoes and went outside. Neither of us said a word. He just put his arms around me and held me closely.
