I'm on a swing thing. There are others and Drew is on one and he likes me and there is a sort of courtship. It is informal and slow. Then there is a short man who is nervous and follows us. The rains have fallen and now the plants are going crazy in a growing fervor. The wooden benches grow up two feet from the force of the plants growing under them. A wall board, or series of wall planks, has plants on them that before the rains were from top to bottom, but now only cover 1/2 the board surface, because it is the boards that are growing like crazy. There is a sense of excitement and happiness at all this wonderful, wild growing; relief. It's been so long since the last rain.
