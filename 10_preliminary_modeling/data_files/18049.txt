I was at Molly's house and we were playing in her backyard and her father came out and said "I'm gonna do my papers our here." Then we saw a porcupine and Molly said, "Oh, a porcupine" and she went up close to it and she stood by the fence watching it and then all of a sudden the porcupine charged right into her leg. Then she showed her dad all the pricking pines. He took them out and he put some Band-Aids on it. The next day Molly took the Band-Aids off and there were just little marks. I slept over of course.
