There are four people in a car. I'm in the passenger side. I am supposed to read the map as we travel. The map is long and narrow, like the road. I have to work fast to keep up with our travels. I get tired. The man driver (we are a couple) gives me permission to fold up the map and relax. We stop because the man of the couple in the back seat has to go to the bathroom. He and she get out to use the woods. We decide to go join them and see them swimming naked in a basement pool. We take off our clothes and crawl through the hole to join them in what seems like an underground cavern, only it's tiled. They are at first concerned because it is dangerous to have us all in there at once, no one up there to go for help if we can't get out. But we relax and have fun, cavorting in the water. The woman decides to get out and swims across the pool and goes in through a door. We start to follow, only to discover we'd walked into an old woman's apartment. She is somewhat surprised to see wet, naked people. We apologize for coming in without knocking. I am a teacher and come in to the classroom. Students are coming in. I erase marks on the blackboard and write, "Barb Sanders, M.S. N.B.C.C. I explain that means I have a Master of Science in Counseling Psychology and am a member of the National Board of Certified Counselors. More students come in and I repeat that naming sequence, and yet again. Three students with rheumatoid arthritis in funny-looking wheelchairs come in and I talk to them. By now the room is very crowded and people are facing both ways as they are seated at long rows of tables. I ask if it would be better if I stood at the other blackboard where I am sideways to them all. We agree that is better. I again do the naming sequence. Then a couple talk and the man says, "Shut up," and smiles. I point out how this is passive-aggressive and begin my lecture on assertiveness, using them as an example.
