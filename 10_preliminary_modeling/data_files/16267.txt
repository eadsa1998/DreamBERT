Lately I've been having some epic dreams, but they escape me as soon as I wake up because I haven't made it onto this tape. But tonight I remember a little bit of pieces of what I dreamt. And I dreamt that I had gone to this concert with Mrs. Dougherty and her class, and I had my mini disc recorder and I was recording it. And at the end the presenters asked for comments, and nobody but two people gave comments. And then when I was walking up to get the newspaper at 24th Avenue and 7th Street, I was still carrying the mini disc recorder and the straight ___ microphone in my other hand to get any kind of other sounds I could, and I saw Mrs. Dougherty at the corner there when I was getting the paper and she said, "No wonder no more people made comments. You had that thing!" Oh, I know, I left it like in the grass the next block away, and then I went up to see her and then she said that. And she ended up walking me home, and I never went back to go and get it. And then I woke up.
