Mom did something and a singer guy made a song called 'Sasha Off Cliff'. We heard gun shots or something across the road. I locked the door (we were at the old house). Mom went to have a shower and I was at the door. Then there was a tap on my shoulder and this guy was there with a gun. There was a knock on the door. I reached into the other room and grabbed a bin. There was another guy at the door and I hit him with the bin and he shot his gun. I threw the bin at him and held it down on him. I was wearing my Spongebob shirt and I got blood on it.
