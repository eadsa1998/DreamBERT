I was out hunting. I saw a rabbit run jump into the water. I could see where he was swimming under water by the disturbing water. I shot at him into the water and I seemed to have missed for he swam underwater further. I aimed again and shot when I went to pick him up. All there was is a pile of fir and a hole thru it in the middle. I had a line of machines I didn't like. Bill G. ran $41 and it wouldn't run off the motor's drive. He put on the belt to the counter shaft to see if it would run as it did when there was not motor drive. Someone was to come and fix the machine and there was a sort of magical meeting before two mystery men came in. I dreamed I saw Vance and Denny at the Boy Scout camp and it was like thru TV or from a distance, and I was shadow shooting at them like boys do with the empty hand and pointing a finger for the gun. I was either thinking in my sleep or I saw an entry in a small field race and the horse had the last pp and was to be a winner like my Sir Walter R. was.
