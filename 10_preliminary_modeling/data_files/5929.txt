Am in a large power boat in the South Atlantic. Water is bright green and weather is pleasant and warm. Many people in boat when all of a sudden it accelerates fast and a man standing in the stern, a friend of mine, falls overboard and disappears beneath the surface. I fear for his safety as someone cries out to beware of sharks. I leap to the stern and then see the black fin of a shark speeding fast toward the boat's stern. Then the fin goes below the surface and I distinctly see the shark flash below deep in the clear water. I am greatly frightened for my friend and I hope he has been able to beat off the shark. Then I look straight up to the sky and realize with chagrin that I haven't prayed for him. I cry aloud to God to save my friend and then look down in water. Surface is crowded with bits of seaweed and debris, but I see no evidence of my friend. He doesn't reappear.
