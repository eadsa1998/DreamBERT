A young woman hugs me. She likes me. I say to the group as a joke, "Hey. We've been going steady for 45 minutes, it's time to have an anniversary (reunion) party." I walk away. Spencer Tracey and I leave. He's helping me. There are two vans exactly alike and people are putting my things in the wrong van. I show them it's the wrong van because the passenger side window has cracks in my van. So we transfer my boxes and papers to the right van. I am impatient. It's taking too long.
