I was at Dad's old place. There wasn't much there and the roof was hanging down for repairs. They were watching TV. I was doing some logic problems in the living room. It mentioned Supernatural so I read the introduction. I realized it was actually about Supernatural. I was going out with Jared Padalecki who was in the lounge room. I called out to Dad and he read through it and I said "after the death of their father, John Winchester, Dean and SAM!" He thought it was funny. I drew a love heart around Sam's name.
