 I go into a small neat lecture room with a group of people. We are going to hear a man give a speech. The man is a really clean-cut, straightedge type of man, and he seems religious. I go in and sit down in a chair next to a person I know. I masturbate briefly, and then stop, realize that I was just masturbating in a room full of people. I'm sitting on the floor on one end of the room next to two women I know from Brimson, but whom I'm not really friends with. The group of people is all straightedge: they don't use any drugs. People start to say their names and a bit about themselves. It goes randomly, different people speak. I share my name and that I'm interested in dream interpretation and analysis. The speaker says that at the last two meetings I have said the same thing: that I'm interested in dream interpretation and analysis. One man there, who may be the speaker, says that he is familiar with my two past lives, or that he knows I had past lives.
