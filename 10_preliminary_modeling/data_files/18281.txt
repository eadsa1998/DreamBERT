I dreamed one of my women friends had a friend who sexually assaulted young children or something of the sort. We were discussing whether we should let this friend come near our children. As we talked, I could see, on this large green meadow, several as if reconstructions of times this person had actually been with our children. I could also see, near the meadow, a long row of motels where this person had stayed, a different one on each occasion. There was also some importance to the number five, as if he stayed in room 5 or in every fifth motel or something. The dream gradually became more and more nightmarish, not in a scary sense, but that something was quite disturbing about all of these, a sort of feverishness. Finally I woke up, very gradually  and still haunted by the vision of this meadow and motels. At last I realized that I had been bitten several times around the arms and back and neck by a flea and that this was bothering me. I went into the bathroom and turned on the light to see the bites and to maybe find the flea. I saw that I had been bitten five times.
