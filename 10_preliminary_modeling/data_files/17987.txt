I was sitting at a small round table talking to my high school badminton team member Maria.  She was talking about playing both the cello and the flute.  Then I was in the back seat of the van and my mother's Uncle Bert was driving the family to a funeral- I saw my (deceased) great grandmother Margaret's arm in a boat.  There was something precarious about the road.
