My dream was set in what appeared to be another planet. The coloring was all brown, except for a few neon lights. This place was not familiar to me in real life, but it seemed to be in my dream. My best friend was in the dream - and she was in search of her meaning in life. She was 16 in my dream, as she is now, and her father encouraged her to find this meaning. The only way she could find her purpose was if her father died. He was aware of this but she was not. He tried numerous times to kill himself in subtle ways - but was never successful. Then he realized the only way to die was if the "mother bird" killed him. This bird was the queen of this place I think. So my friend was told by her dad that he only had 30 minutes left. The minutes were counted on a bomb-like digital clock. When 30 minutes were up, a giant white bird with neon pink streaks appeared and pointed at him and he exploded like a firework.
