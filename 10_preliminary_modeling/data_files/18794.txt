I was in a cabin someplace where it was snowing with this girl from the Hot Shops [a restaurant in S. Miami]. We were married but we didn't agree to this marriage. We were just kind of thrown into it. So we were in this cabin and I said to her, "Well, I guess it's alright if I kiss you now since we are married." (I know this girl personally, I speak to her all the time.)
