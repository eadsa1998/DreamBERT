I was in a room. Jeremy Piven and some other guys in there too. We were watching TV. I went into the next room (which didn't have a door) and I was naked and getting changed. I turned around so that my back was facing them so I could put a towel around myself. Jeremy Piven then said something to Kevin Dillon and when I turned they were looking and Kevin turned back around but Jeremy kept looking. I then sat down and felt really uncomfortable. Then I was at a shop outside, and all these people of a certain age (and other characteristics) turned into females with tongue piercings and I was extremely annoyed about it. People outside were going to break in.
