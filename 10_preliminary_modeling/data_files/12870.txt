I was at home. I did a reality check, which worked. I went to my room and tried to make it a different place, but it didn't change, so I went back down the hallway and wished for James Spader. I went back and he was there and my bed was coming from the window and we started kissing. I lost lucidity, and we ended up having sex. Later, I was talking to Vivian about lucid dreaming. There was a newspaper and I said now the writing will change. I turned around and it changed.
