I was on the porch of the house we last lived in before we left my home state. I was home from the hospital. I was wearing some hospital clothing. A woman next door came out, but we were not on speaking terms. Then the man who lives next door to my home in Plainview came out and we talked about the plants in the garden and the small lizards that stayed there.
