I was playing World of Warcraft. I was on a farm. There were three sets of mobs that I had to kill. I had to change each one to a different setting as I went around killing them. There were two flight masters right next to each other. Ezra was with me later. Then I was watching One Tree Hill and I paused the episode on Haley and Nathan. Ezra was like 'Yes I know she's in the movie' -- we were going to the cinema later. I said 'oh yeah, I forgot'. Jensen Ackles was also in the movie. There was an episode of Supernatural and Sam's fake name was 'RPlecki' and I thought it was funny. I also watched The OC and Summer was in a hospital bed and was like asleep. She was angry at Seth. He came and was watching her through the window. They then had sex in the bed and were messed up in the blanket and her father came in. But he had just imagined it all and was still standing out there wondering what to do.
