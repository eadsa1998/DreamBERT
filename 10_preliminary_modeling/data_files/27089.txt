It was an hour before my sister's (age 22) wedding. I was all ready dressed in my bridesmaid dress. I kept wandering around and my dress fit loosely and was getting wrinkled and dirty. I saw the bride in back of a house--it was not my sister but a friend from home (age 24-female). I wandered around some more--The time went so slow. Then I saw the bride sitting on a rack all by herself--this time it was a sorority sister of mine (age 22). She had a terrible rash on her face. Then I was on an elevator with an usher whom I did not know. We got off the elevator and many many people standing outside a big building. Then I saw my sister. She was not dressed in her wedding dress but in her "going away outfit." At that moment another friend (age l9--female) danced by in a white dress with red flying panels which she held at arms length. Then I noticed that I had forgotten my gold slippers and my mother (age 45) was just telling my sister to drive me home after them when I woke up.
