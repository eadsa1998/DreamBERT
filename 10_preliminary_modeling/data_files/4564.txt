["Elder couple are ill and I help them."] An old man and woman are together, waiting on the sidewalk. I am in a station wagon. I get out to help them into the car. The woman feels faint and sick. I say they need to see a Doctor. I suggest they make an emergency appointment. They don't think they want to go to that trouble. I try and pick up the old woman and scoot her from the back of the station wagon into the back seat. She is limp and frail. I apologize to her if I hurt her or startled her. They finally agree to check in with the Doctor.
