I am in a hold, like a cellar, in a lot next to the old cemetery in my hometown. I am trying to get out. Something about a baby buffalo being there also, but it gets through a hole in the fence outside. I am about to get out when my oldest jumps in. He is being chased by Ross. (Ross was almost like a foster child to us as he lived with us much of the time.) There is another boy with Ross. Ross should be someone we can trust. There is also a skunk in the basement that doesn't look like a skunk. It lives in a hole in the south end of the basement and I don't remember what happens to it. Ross backs my car up to the window to gas us. Then, for some reason, they all jump in the hole. They help me out. I run to the road for help as I am afraid they will hurt my son. Then I wake up.
