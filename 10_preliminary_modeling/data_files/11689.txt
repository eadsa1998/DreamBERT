I was walking down the hallway (at Newtown) from my room, and there were windows where the cupboards should have been and there were these creepy monkeys. I walked past the toilet and there was this thing looking in. It was a light brown colour, and had little black eyes. It looked like the red thing from Looney Tunes. It was called the Easter. It ate Easter eggs, and went "mmm". It was really evil and scary. I went and hid in Mom and Dad's room. The curtains were closed, and the Easter was right outside, going "mmm".
