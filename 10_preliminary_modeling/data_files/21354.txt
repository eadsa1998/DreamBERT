I saw the PP winners of the 1st race at Cranwood in the paper. All I remember is 8 pp 1st 7 pp 2nd. I saw Ray K. He was beside his car. It started to roll and he let it go, then he ran after it. It was going around down a road and he took a shortcut to head it off, but couldn't make it. Then there was an image of him or a double in the car. The car made a stop at the bottom of the hill and when Ray came near, his double or image of him, the image disappeared in thin air. I picked up something. I can't remember now, but it had a #43 on it.
