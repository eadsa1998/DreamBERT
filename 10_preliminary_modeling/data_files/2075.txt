I see a pretty plant. I want to grow one and ask someone how I would do that. He says we have to get permission to dig a pond, and I say, "I own this land. We can dig here." He starts to dig in the front lawn but I say, "No, I want it here on this plot in the back yard." I see a very green space of lawn and open windows around it. He shows me different plants. I am particularly interested in the "Umbrella Plant." He shows me one that has no roots and he lifts it up. I worry that will kill it, but he says, "No," and puts it back on the sand. I say, "I want to help." So he sets me to the task of cutting off the tops of gallon plastic milk jugs. As I'm doing this, Bonnie comes by. She's very tired and stressed out from work. It's a Monday. I empathize with her.
