I had been standing in my bedroom all day watching the peculiar actions of a blimp. It would fly back and forth over the house and disappear for a few minutes. It remained rather high in the air until the afternoon. Then gray clouds began to form in the horizon and the blimp came lower and lower. I put on my pea jacket and reached the backyard just in time to see the silvery blimp land in a field that adjoins our home. I was absolutely amazed. Why should a blimp land here? A small door in the gondola opened and two crew members climbed out. They wore navy uniforms. Suddenly I noticed one of my fraternity brothers (who is a clown and not a very good student) running over to the man who appeared to be in charge. My fraternity brother assured him that it was permissible to moor the blimp in the field for as long as he desired. The captain of the blimp said he must leave soon. My fraternity brother was disappointed for he wanted to use the blimp for an air force demonstration at school.
