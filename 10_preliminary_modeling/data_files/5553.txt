[1997-05-15] I am in a gymnasium of the school for the blind that I attended when I was little and its about mid-afternoon and there were a lot of people there, many of them were from other states, they were having a party and I was talking to a man there whose name I can't remember and we were supposed to start working on a project but we didn't, we were just conversing.
