A beautiful blonde-haired, blue-eyed young woman in ringlets and a gold chip hat (dressed like in Little Women) comes in and hugs Lydia saying, "Oh! You were that cute little one." She then comes close up to me and looks into my eyes before she hugs me. She says, "Do you remember me?" I say, "No, I don't. Are you one of the California cousins?" She laughs and hugs and moves on.
