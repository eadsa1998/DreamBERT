I'm in a plane. We go to Russia. We sneak in through a fireplace and try to mingle with the Russians. There is a factory. We visit it. Then we have to leave before we get caught. As we go back to the fireplace, I stop at a bathroom. Some women are upset with me because I've been there, and they've had to go hungry. They are going to turn me in. I talk with them. They are sullen and resentful but don't turn me in. I respect their feelings. I sneak back through the fireplace to the airplane. I gather up powdered eggs, milk, etc. to take back to the women. It's only fair. We sneak back into Russia. Sometimes we are invisible because the solders or cops are near by. We sneak into the house. The women are in the kitchen, doing dishes. We bring the food to them. We are all pleased with each other. Then it is time to go. We sneak back to the plane but are seen. Now we scramble and get into the air. Planes are after us. It is important to get out of Russian territory so in case we get hit, we won't land on Russian grounds. We duck and fly low because their jets can't. It's foggy and cloudy and I call out the names of the high mountains we are zigzagging through. There is much tension. "Big Mama" mountain is on the left, "Bear" mountain, the Rockies. Then we go up behind the Russian jet, and strafe it with machine gun bullets. The jet goes down. We're over water now. Just before it hits, I yell, "Nuke bomb!" We scramble into our yellow, anti-radiation suits. They are like giant sleeper suits. We put on masks that protect our faces and we breath filtered air. We look back at the huge cloud rising from where the jet crashed. We had gone fast to get out of the shock wave area. The cloud was even bigger and more deadly than a mushroom cloud. Then I see many more of them. "What's going on?" I ask. "Why are there more?"
