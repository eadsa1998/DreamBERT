I dream something that I interpret means I must kill the mother inside me (the negative mother). Then I dream something about that not being right. I must let the negative mother die. That is better. Then I am an older woman who calls my family together to announce that I am running for the Senate. The president of the United States called me and asked me to serve. The women in the family are happy. My husband and son or son-in-law are unhappy, especially when I answer the question of how much will I earn. The answer is $60,000. This is more than my husband makes. I hope he will be able to handle this.
