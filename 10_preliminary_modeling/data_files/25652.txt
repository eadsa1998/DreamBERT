 I'm in Vail, Colorado, with friends, to ski. I'm putting on my ski gear outside by a snow bank where two women are sitting. I have a bottle of Captain Morgan rum in my left pocket. The pocket has a hole in it. I take the rum out and put it in my right pocket. I see my right pocket has a hole in it too. The holes are so big the bottle easily slips out. I get "31 Ram" skis, my brother Wally tells me when I go into the ski rental shop. They are for skiing tracks. There are some garbage bins there. Others and I are supposed to take the bins somewhere, fill them up, and bring them back. I walk over with my bin to fill it. The guy from who I am supposed to fill my bin has an empty bin. He may be a Brimson student I know from intramural basketball. I fill my bin up at the place and I dump it.
