I am at some women's conference. In between sessions. I see Roseanne Barr on a stage. She is naked with an elaborate tattoo on her fat butt. Another woman is naked as well. They are laughing and talking about some topic. Roseanne sits down on a chair with her back to the audience to better show off her tattoo. She is enjoying this. She teases the audience by putting her hand back to cover her anus, like she's shy. Later I am walking around, looking for Charlotte Mesquita. I am walking right next to the naked Roseanne. Her breasts are very small. She is chuckling about her flat fat tummy. Now I go into the restroom to pee.  Lots of women are in the stall, which is large with me. They are combing their hair and chatting. I wipe myself. Lots of shit, and it is messy. A woman wants to use the toilet and I hurry.  A piece of shit falls on the floor and the woman kindly picks it up and puts it in the wastebasket for me. I feel embarrassed she had to do that. I get up and go out, still looking for Bonnie. I walk to a bench on the path with a pile of clothes and so on. I brush my hair which is in a short wedge cut with some of my long hair still in the back. I see Sonja leading a group of blind women in a line. I see Abner in another group. I call to Sonja that I will join her soon. I have a ten dollar bill tucked into my skirt waist to give to Bonnie when I find her. I go to a cabin where a mirror hangs on the outside to see if my hair looks OK. A woman is just inside the open door, sweeping. I can't really see myself in the mirror. I am wearing a long flowing colorful skirt.
