I was doing computer editing, creating and checking web links to other sites. It seems that it's a page, kind of a table of contents for a publication. This page has two entries from each section of the magazine and I think this page is just two issues. I'm working on it because I just recently discovered that there was a problem with them. There is another person involved in this, but somehow indirectly. There is some kind of physical implication for this other person, something that requires much effort for that person. It's as though I hear someone telling him, Come on. You can do this. I know it's hard, but you can overcome this. Look. Look. You're doing it.
