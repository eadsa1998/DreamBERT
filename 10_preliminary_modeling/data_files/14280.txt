I was out the back at home. I was cleaning around the side of the house. There were dead kittens under a slab which was resting diagonally against the wall of bricks. Mom was there. I was then at her place and it was night and her house was different and bigger. She decided to go see a friend of hers. There was a TV show called Hancock and along with some other torrents, I had it ready to download. I started getting scared, as I was alone, and called Mom. She asked if I wanted her to come back and she said she would come by and I said to not worry. I was jiggling the cord from the phone. I was then at someone's house and someone said the neighbour was nice or something. I was in a class and Dad was there, I think and the teacher was there. He gave me a pencil and told me he was going to get me to write a sentence to take these monsters "out of the world and into words". I said "that doesn't really help" (make sense). He said something and he was a monster/bad guy. People would realize they didn't come there by chance? Some time earlier I was in bed, sleeping. I woke up and Spaceman, Cuddles and Gizmo were on my bed as well as some people. I was trying to take a photo.
