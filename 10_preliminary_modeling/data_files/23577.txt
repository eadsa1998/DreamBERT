This large family is going to some type of outdoor church social. They are riding bikes which are somehow connected together. The youngest daughter is being pushed by them. The colors are very bright, neon. A woman asks me for a slice of apple pie. One is wrapped in Saran-wrap but it has coffee stains. There are four other pieces, but each has a bite taken out of it. Sam says that when he wants to save a slice for himself, he writes his name on a piece of paper and puts it on top. A group of men are laughing at me and I realize that they ate the pies for a joke. In my apartment I'm burning toast for this woman and it drops on the floor once it's been buttered. At the social, a little girl asks me why Bibby (our cat) will only sit with me or Sam. I tell her that if we weren't here, she would sit with anybody. We're her parents, so she stays by us. The family seems poor and uneducated. The men are unshaven and tough.
