It was about the late President Kennedy, and it was some of a monologue biography of his youth, just talking about at the age so and so and so and so, but however, it wasn't Kennedy in the picture. There was someone else talking. Besides that there was whatever talking was in the scene itself as if it was a narrated play, but the picture wasn't Kennedy, but supposedly myself. So, in other words, it seemed like they were talking about Kennedy, but I was in the picture. Just retelling that it happened circumstance instance. Most of the time I was sitting on a bed looking at a magazine and carrying on whatever conversation I was having. I knew that I was on the bed because I happened to look into a mirror and actually saw my own face. I knew it was Jackie Kennedy, well, because she was in the same room. However, there were no sexual connotations. We were both fully dressed. It seemed as if she was changing moods with the narration. Mr. Kennedy wasn't really the center of the dream. He was, he just happened to be the guy I was talking about. But I didn't see any guy. It was just me and her. It was not a well-organized thought pattern. What I mean is things didn't happen real logically. One minute it seemed like the interest was in or about Mr. Kennedy, and the next time it was about, well, Jackie and myself. The impression most left was that of referring to Kennedy as a young child, not a young child, but near his youth, more so than after he became president. What was weird about the setting was that it wasn't logical in the sense the bedroom, we weren't on the same bed, or I was on one large double bed and sort of as if on stage, you know, as you look at a stage towards the back of the stage, directly, back, well, it was like she was down on that bed so there didn't seem to be any sexual implication. It was just a situation where she was there and I was in the same scene, and apparently there was some action being evolved around being in the same room.
