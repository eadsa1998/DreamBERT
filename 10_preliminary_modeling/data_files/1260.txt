I am doing a video for the C. dept. Co-worker Josh wants to watch. I feel relieved that I am finally doing something legitimate when he watches. We are taking pictures of president Reagan as he swims in the ocean. He makes a real fool of himself, splashing and diving, because it's too shallow. I think, "Oh, he's going down for the 3rd time." As I walk back out of the water, I step on an eye under the sand. I think, "Yuck! Sharks!" [BL]
