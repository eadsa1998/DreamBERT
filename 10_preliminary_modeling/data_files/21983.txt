I went to see something into a store and to my surprise it was a doctor's office. He was talking to patients of how he restored limbs for them. Then he told me he had put a pin in one of my fingers. It was stiff and he restored its flexibility. I was looking at my fingers and trying to recall the incident but couldn't.
