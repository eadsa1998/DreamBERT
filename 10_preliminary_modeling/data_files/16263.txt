I was going to take the Peavey system to a party like in a courtyard, and Mom stopped at 7-11 and got a bottle of wine for us to drink, like we do coffee there sometimes. And then all of a sudden I was at home working on DP. I was editing a file that had some variation in it as to what was going on and what was going to happen at the party. And I didn't really want Dad to hear it, so I kind of like tried to close it out real fast before it actually opened, and it got all screwed up. And then I woke up. [laugh] Hmmm.
