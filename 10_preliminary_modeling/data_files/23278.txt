I was at a fancy house in the city where I worked, on the front porch handing out invitations to people who arrived.  The details are a little hazy now.  There was a rack of engraved invitations and other kinds of printed material.  Somebody asked me for 30 invitations, and I didn't know if I could scrape up that many.  Someone else asked me to write down something, and I said I didn't have anything to write it on; they told me to use one of Ronald Reagan's cards.  I looked, and there were indeed several Ronald Reagan calling cards.
