 I'm at a party at my friend Binky Ahmed's house. His house is not where it actually is, but rather is in the south. A hurricane is moving through. I'm outside the house with my dad. He has an instrument to see and mark storms. He sees one and gives me the instrument. I look, and see some clouds, some of which are funnel-like. My dad tells me to find the storm and mark it, or measure it, or do something with the instrument to identify or track it. I don't know how. The instrument changes and becomes big and bulky. I don't know how to use it. The storm blows over, without a hurricane in it.
