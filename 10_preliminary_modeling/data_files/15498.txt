I was at a school. Usually I'd leave at a certain time to get to work. People were distracting me and when I checked the time, it was 5.15pm and was late. I was already dressed, but panicked and said that I'd never been there later than 5 minutes early. This guy kept annoying me. I couldn't find my keys. He came up to me with my keys and it turned out he had taken my car. He said he just took it up the road and 'Angela' got in and kissed him. I ran to my car and it was now 5 minutes from start time. I called Chicken Treat and it was the wrong number and some music store. Isaak called me saying "Izzy?" and I said my car had been taken but that I was leaving now. They called in another guy to help me. Outside there was a tree with fruit in baskets and some were rotten. Chris O'Dowd and some others were there. One of them said something about something we did last night -- a 'drunken adventure'. There was a video of Chris blowing himself up in a car (though not really).
