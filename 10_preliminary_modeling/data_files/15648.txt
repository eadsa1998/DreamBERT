I was at a video shop with Ezra. I was in the horror section and had seen most of the ones there, but found a few interesting looking ones. We left and I saw Spaceman and Rover and put them in the car. I drove off and it was raining. I ended up in a lake and the car sank right to the bottom, but we managed to escape just before that. I got back to the shore and then remembered about the pets. I swam back and found the car and got them out and pushed them to the surface.
