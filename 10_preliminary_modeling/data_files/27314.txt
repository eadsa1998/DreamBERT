I dreamed I wished to be married and everyone was happy about the ceremony except me. Although I wanted to be married, I felt I was going against something or somebody. I felt guilty. Then suddenly my father tried to choke me to death. He was very composed. He showed no emotion while choking me. I wasn't afraid of death, but of my father. To be a little clearer, I was more afraid of having made my father angry, then being killed myself.
