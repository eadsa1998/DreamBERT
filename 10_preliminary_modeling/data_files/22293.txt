It was a dream similar to the one on the 6th of September; the same familiar characters (schoolmates) and others I have never seen or I don't remember. My dream was still centered around the girl I love. The same thing happened. I chased her and she chased me. I wasn't able to catch her, because there was always the same distance between the two of us, even when I ran fast.
