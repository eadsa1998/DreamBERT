I was at home when I answered the door. A person was there who said, "Congratulations, you have won anything and everything you want forever." I fainted but when I came to, I started. I got all of the Barbie stuff I wanted, and all of the everything I wanted. I got my parents big houses and adopted lots of animals. I was very happy. Setting: At home, it lots of stores, and the humane society. Characters: A person at the door. Salesmen and women, mom, dad, friends, family. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy. I thought it was the best dream I ever had.
