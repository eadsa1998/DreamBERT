I was watching something with Ezra. James Spader was in it and was wearing a tight red jacket and looked really hot. I thought he seemed gay and then he kissed this other guy and I was happy about it. Ezra said he didn't want to watch it and I said 'it's the 80s, it won't be graphic', but he left. It ended up being quite graphic for an 80s film with a graphic sex scene.
