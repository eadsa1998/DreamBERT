[1997-05-30] I was in some kind of cafeteria like thing, there were tables and chairs, like you would find at a church or something and the cafeteria was echoey and there were 2 nuns there. One nun was sister Kate and I could hear in her voice, she was trying to persuade me to teach class and the other nun, possibly sister Gert a nun from Ireland and she said I've got to get what your assignment is, I'm going to go into a box and draw your assignment. Whatever paper you draw, that's what you'll be teaching and in my dream I could definitely hear voices, echoes, but there are no bodies. They're like spirit. When she hands me something there are no bodies, no arms or hands. When she said I'm going to go get your assignment, I didn't hear her foot steps, she just disappeared and it was like a spirit.
