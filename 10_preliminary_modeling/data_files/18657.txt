Me and Corrine shared the tree house without the good view. There were puppet shows in the tree house and Jasmine was teaching 2 classes on how to make puppets. ??? There was snow in the real, but projected, scenery and the branch started breaking. I grabbed onto the branch I was standing on, very high, with brick walls. Fall. I was assigned the ??? ??? was prettier on the thought there were, Merri!" When I climbed up on Annie passed by and climbed up the tree and held on but I was standing up on the edge.

Someone brought a pumpkin pie that was runny. Corrine's cake tasted good, but I just tasted one bite. The cakes were just alike except for size and shape. The art school had a big sign, 3 feet deep and 20 feet long, that said, NO STUDENTS KILLED BY CARS THAT RAN OFF THE HIGHWAY.
