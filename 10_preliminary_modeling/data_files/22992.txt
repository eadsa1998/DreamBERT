Mother and my sister Nancy and I were at a dinner party at a very nice house-belonging to Paul and Jean Sparkles, I believe.  Nancy was much younger-maybe 10 or so.  Some other little girl was there who was really a brat.  She threw a whole plate of food against a wall and it stuck there, plate and all.  The hostess didn't see it, and I was going to tell her, but Mother reprimanded me and said it wouldn't be polite to tattle on her, that we had to let her figure out the truth for herself.  So I did, but I didn't like the possibility that the suspicion might fall on Nancy.  Fortunately, the other kid was such a brat that I think there could have been little doubt who did it.  <p
