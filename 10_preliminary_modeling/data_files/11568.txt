I was in a strange town, living at a strange hotel. It occurred to me that I was at a convention of some sort. I seemed to be floating not walking around. I spoke to people easily and casually but do not remember any of the people and it occurred to me at the time that I did not know them. I kept looking for clothing stores. I had a desire to buy some clothes. I kept looking but couldn't find anything but drug stores, jewelry stores and fruit stores. I became frustrated and started back to my hotel. When I got to my hotel I noticed that on both sides of it was located a jewelry store.
