I was trying to get away from someone.  I went into a small nook where there was a good-looking man.  I was very turned on by him and we were going to make out, but we had to get away from the person first.  We got into an inflatable raft; I think it had a leak in it.  Once we set out I tried to kiss him again, but we were again interrupted.  The person who was trying to control me/us did something magical.  Everything around us disappeared until we could only see at a distance the small port we'd left from, before everything else had been built there.  We had been sent back in time.  We somehow wanted to set things back to the way we knew them and ran to a casting call for the Wizard of Oz.  We didn't quite make it in and seemingly went to several different castings before we got there just before a small person in a gray dog costume and a person with a pumpkin for a head.  It was first come first cast, so we were in, finally.  At the small entrance to some sort of vehicle we all stopped to have lunch.  I thought we should all share and have the variety, but the man and I were left with corn with tomatoes.
