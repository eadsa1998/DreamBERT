Mom went off to someone's house and Ezra and I were stuck in the car. He decided to have a go driving and was going over the speed limit. He turned corners wide and wouldn't stop in time at lights, which I thought was the 'same thing as me'. He stopped and I said I'd drive now because it was safer. I pulled out of a driveway then turned the car. I was going up the street, fast and wouldn't brake. I turned left and then took the next right, and then I couldn't brake or control the car and it crashed into a house into the lounge room. This lady came out yelling at me. I said the brake didn't work. The window was smashed and there were two kids inside the room. I went inside and she yelled at me still and I yelled "It's not as if I went out tonight thinking 'Oh, I might go crash into a house',". Ezra traded lawyer details and ours was on a poster with contact information and his name was Christopher Leeley, or something. There were pictures of him too. We left and the brakes weren't working well and there was a screeching noise. We found Mom and she was with a dude who had milk.
