Dreamt about my dad again. In this dream we were having a big argument. I think I told you that in reality my mother has Alzheimer's disease, she was just recently diagnosed, there have been a lot of problems with her short term memory and forgetting things, leaving doors open instead of locking them and things like that. In this dream I had a big argument with my father and I said "How can you leave me with this?!" I was so mad because I thought that he had left me to deal with this and he said "I guess you'll just have to deal with it the best you can!" And that's what he would have said. Basically the sense I used in this dream was hearing, we were shouting, we were arguing back and forth with each other. I don't exactly know where we were. We were standing in a room facing each other and yelling at each other, so I could feel myself standing like I normally can. It wasn't a very pleasant dream but it had a sense of reality to it.
