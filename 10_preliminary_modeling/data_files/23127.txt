I was planning to play softball with some guys that I didn't know very well.  I understood that the game was the next morning at 9 a.m., but I didn't know where it was to be played.  Someone gave me a number to call at a military academy, and I called and found out the field we were to play on.  After I hung up, though, I realized that I hadn't asked for directions.  One of the guys said just to ask at some office-I forget which one-but of course I didn't know where that office was either.  But then the game was to take place right away, and the guys were heading from one field to another.  When I had crossed one field, I remembered that I had left my glove and other stuff at the field we were leaving, so had to go back and get it.  Then I also found that I had no sneakers, only a pair of loose-fitting loafers.  I decided I would have to play barefoot.  I ran a few sprints to find how it would be, and I found I could run really fast, and turn on some extra speed for short bursts.  Then there was a little girl that I had to take care of.  She had on a sweater that was all tangled and twisted.  I decided I would have to take it off and put my sweatshirt on her.  I needed someone to help me get it off of her.  By this time, I didn't know where the other guys had gone.
