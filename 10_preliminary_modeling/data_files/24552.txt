First, I was singing in the My school Choir. Then my friend Anna and I went up to the bathroom. For some strange reason, when you pulled the paper towels out, water squirted you in the face. I got squirted. Then we were transported into a desert. I got cut on three thorns. We were trying to get back to My school. Then we came to the top of a building. We were on top. We looked over the edge. There was Bobbie's room. Bobbie and her husband, who said he was 1 zillion years old, came out. Bobbie said, "This hasn't happened in years!" Then they lifted us down. Setting: My school - a choir room and then the bathroom, then a desert. Characters: The My school choir, GG (wearing light blue pants, and a white shirt with some sort of design), Anna (don't remember what she was wearing), Bobbie (wearing a black suit with a white collar) and her husband (I don't know him - he was wearing a red flannel shirt with jeans). Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, worried. It was very strange 'cause last night I watched a movie about the West.
