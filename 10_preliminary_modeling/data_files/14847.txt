I was talking to Mom and I mentioned Sam Rockwell to her and I said his father did something and she said 'I know' and I was like 'how the hell do you know?' and she said we were related to him. She had been talking to him through email for a while and had discovered we were related (not closely). I checked my email and I had emails from him. She had sent him some, pretending to be, saying 'I had a crush on you' etc. One said 'don't worry, I'm still your friend' and something about The Pythons. I found out Mom had also been talking to the members of Monty Python.
