I was with G. in the South Station. While she stood by, I asked for two tickets to Worcester, received them, and laid down a five-dollar bill. Just then G. declared she would not go with me and I asked the agent to take back one ticket. He said that he could not because he had stamped it. I regretfully kept both. Meantime, I had received as change due me a pair of fur-lined gloves.
