["Darryl wasn't the one, after all."]  I am upset with Darryl. Another man with dark hair is with me. We are friends and we like each other. He is supporting me emotionally through this. I go to my apartment and dig through a pile of old things, letters and papers and so on. Memorabilia. I find the letter I am looking for, the one I wrote to Darryl at the end of our relationship. Ginny is around being sympathetic. I need to verify a date. 4/16 or something. I find it and get angry again at his betrayal and abandoning me. It is a good cathartic moment which sweeps any remaining love feelings out of my heart for him. The man with me is very glad, because our friendship has blossomed into a love relationship and I can finally acknowledge it.
