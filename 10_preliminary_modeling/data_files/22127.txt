I was taking a Physics exam. I had studied so much that everything was confused. Then I looked at the time and the time kept running shorter. I was feverishly trying to give a good answer. Later on I solved the questions. Two days later I saw my grade and I had flunked. I was very disappointed. I realized I was a failure for mankind and I started to feel sorry for myself.
