I went to the old house with Mom. A guy broke into the car and took my laptop and some other stuff. We went back and got something back but the rest was gone and I realised it was Quincy who had taken them. I said that I'd ruined Darren's chances of getting a job unless I got it back. Ezra was there. Quincy was on the phone and yelling saying 'she's telling the truth' and that he'd already gotten rid of it. I said I wanted money then. He said "I'll give you $50" and I said I needed at least $300-$400.
