There is a huge TURTLE in our yard, rolling in the mud in a death struggle... No one can approach it, as it writhes in the MUD. It is ugly and dangerous. We have to watch our 2 year old so that she does not go too near to the writhing creature. Finally someone yells: "he's dead!," but we can't see it, since it is in another part of the yard....
