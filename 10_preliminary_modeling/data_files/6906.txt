I was visiting R. After chatting, I said I must leave now and went to get my things. Found my handbag but not my black coat. I couldn't remember how I had brought my nightgown. I was to go to stay at the Y.W. Perhaps they would not have room for me so R. gave me two addresses. I had trouble in hearing them.
