["Secret bus"]  I am walking in an open area. I see some boxes and racks with used items there. I dig around and find a purse and a sundress. I am going to buy them, but then I notice the purse's handle is missing and has a seam open. The dress doesn't have an elastic waist, so I won't fit into it. I decide to leave them, although I like the openings on the purse. I can manage them with my hands. There are people there that are part of a secret group, called the MOI. I follow them, searching for their secret headquarters. I see a bus and get on it. I am now in a wheelchair and notice the bus is very spacious, allowing great accessibility for the chair. I see a display panel and look at it closely. I find an ensignia of the MOI there and realize I have found their secret place. I continue to casually observe as I wheel down the aisle which is a grassy path. There are no visible signs of the bus. No floors, or walls. It looks like I'm strolling down a meadow path. At the back end of the bus, I see some young men in suits who are part of the MOI crew. I notice they have sleeping quarters and a bathroom set up back there. They watch me suspiciously. I pretend to be an innocent tourist.
