I was at university in Communications. I was in my normal spot and Preston was sitting a desk away (in the one near the wall). I had another class after but I had to go on the bus. I tagged on and sat at the back. Brent, Preston and someone else came on and sat together in the row next to me. The next class was also a Comms class. There was a sign-in thing which mentioned why we were doing this course for a "higher TER". Lillian was in the class and so was Preston. He sat down in one of the first seats and I sat in my usual seat. Also, I hadn't seen Preston in this class before.
