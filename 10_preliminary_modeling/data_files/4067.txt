["Buddy Guy And I"]  I am in an auditorium. There is a music concert of blues there. The seats are like theatre seats, raked up. I am seated up toward the top. I am looking down at the performance area, watching the two black men playing their guitars and singing the blues. They are good. One comes up the aisle still playing his guitar. It is Buddy Guy. He sees me and smiles. He nods at me, inviting me to walk with him and dance. We slide down the row of theatre seats  in a gliding dancing motion. It is great fun. We are in rhythm and enjoying this together. We dance back up the aisle. Now we are close together, attracted and feeling warm and loving. I tell him he is being discounted and not used up to his potential by these other people who are more interested in their own egos. He sees it my way and we decide to break off from the music group he was with and go out on our own.
