Bill C. was conducting a meeting. I don't know who was there - if it was all staff or if it was other people. There were more people in attendance than we have staff in waking life. Jane C was there also but she looked different than in waking life. She started being critical of him in front of everyone. Apparently she felt that he had been rude or mean or something to several people and she was saying things like, Don't contact them. Don't make any attempt to speak with them. Then she got up and walked away. There was a woman sitting next to me but I don't know now who it was or if I knew her in the dream. I leaned over and whispered, I don't think they're going to last. I was implying that their marriage was in trouble. The woman said, No. I don't think so either. She said something else as to why she thought that. It seemed that maybe she thought they were already having discussions about separating.
