I crashed my car. I was afraid my father would be made at me, but I saw him and he wasn't upset at all. Then a killer was after me. I went to my mom's house and asked her to hide me out. She told me that I couldn't stay there, that I should go to the police. I found the police and I told them about the killer that was after me. They seemed to think that I was just some hysterical nut. They were driving a convertible police car. They told me to get in and they would take me down to the station and ask me some questions. The killer popped up and stabbed the policewoman in the heart. The policeman went speeding away. I knew I had to think fast and get out of there. I flew up and landed on top of this enormously high pole. I thought, "Oh, great, how long can I stay up here?"
