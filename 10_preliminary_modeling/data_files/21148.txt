I was dozing when Louie came up to me and said, "Look out the window." Irene told me to kiss her, so I grabbed her and did she squeeze me and held on. I walked thru the house, which was big, with my old oily working shoes. I mopped up the floor. I was looking at refrigerators. A man wanted me to work on them. I saw 00 on a ticket. The 00 showed plain and the rest was almost erased. Allen Ruis was small. He was sitting on the ground. A dog came up and licked his face. He was frightened. I could see it on his face. I yelled at the dog and we went away.
