I was somehow visiting the home or cabin of a mountaineer family. I had never seen this cabin or the people in it before. However, what impressed me the most was the filth and poverty in which these people lived. It seemed that there were about eight or nine people living in this one run down cabin. There were both old people and small children and apparently all belonged to the same family. They spoke to me and seemed happy. I don't believe that anything of importance was said. I can't recall speaking to them but I may have.
