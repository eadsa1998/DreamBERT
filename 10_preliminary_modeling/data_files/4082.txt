["This Isn't Right"]  I am in my Grandma Agnes' living room, except it is different. A small separate room is there which has large photos of the grandchildren. Now I am in an indoor open space. I am involved in some kind of performance preparation. Lots of women are there. Ginny is there. Now Ernie is there. I feel love for him. He feels it for me. But it is wrong to be sexual. I take a bath. Ernie comes in. He and I go into another room and lie down on the floor and begin to make love. We want to, but Ernie, in particular feels great hesitation, obviously because of his love for Ginny. I try to encourage him by kissing and so on. But he stops it and says "This is wrong." He gets up, but then Ginny enters the room and we frantically try to appear like we didn't have sex. I am pulling off his T-shirt and trying to cover myself under a blanket in the single bed. I lie under a water blanket and pretend to sleep.
