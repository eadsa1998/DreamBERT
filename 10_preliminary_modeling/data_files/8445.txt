Jo V , Jan F and a friend of theirs had come to visit me. I think I had gone out for a walk and when I was coming back I saw Jo V getting in her car getting ready to leave. Her friend was standing at the passenger side, I think saying good-bye. Jo V had her window down. At first I just waved and kept walking, then realized she might be on her way back home or maybe I wanted to find out where she was going. I went over to the car and leaned in through the window and gave her a hug and a kiss on the cheek. Someone said something about her not going out much, or not going out at all to do anything while she was there. I'm not sure which of the three of us said it. I didn't make a big deal about it because I know Jo V likes her time alone. But I also know that when her and Jan F come to visit they do usually go out and do something. Now I'm standing with Jan F and the other woman in front of one of their cars. Jan F is checking her oil. I said something to Jan F about the fact that her and Jo V did not go out anywhere during this visit. She looked at me, kind of sideways - turning her head slightly down and to the left - look at me from the top of her eyes. She said that her and Jo V are thinking about breaking up over this. I said I recognized that it was unlike the two of you not to go out during your visit. It seems that this third person is part of the problem though also. As though either Jo V or Jan F saw her as a threat to their relationship - that the other might have a romantic interest in her.
