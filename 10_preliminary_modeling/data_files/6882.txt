N., R. and I are starting down to church in the evening. R. wants to go around King Street to avoid the broken sidewalk. I protest it's too far that way. I am tired and will go via P. Street even if they don't. N. is holding me by the arm. I insist I will go down P. Street. Finally N. goes with me and the others via King Street. On the way, we pass an eight year old boy building with blocks. He has two castle facades and a plan built. I ask if he's building a castle. "No, it's a big house for a cattleman." I notice a 4 inch long rubber cow. We go on and I say, "Let's go in." It's a large near empty auditorium with a slanting door. N. goes to front row next to piano at left. I ask if she'd mind going one row behind since there are only two seats in front and pianist might want to sit there when off stool. N. changes. I look back, the room is nearly filled now and I see R. and the rest high up near the rear wearing flowered hats.
