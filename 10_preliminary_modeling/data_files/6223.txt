I had a dream that my mother had died. I attended the wake and saw her lying there. I felt like I wanted to die so she wouldn't be alone but I also had to be there to help my family. They were counting on me. I was indecisive whether to join my mother, thinking I had the chance to be with her or taking care of the family. When I saw how rough my little brother was taking it, I decided to stay and help him. He was a mess. I comforted him and tried to make him feel better, but I couldn't.
