Wendy and Bruce: and Frank and I, and many others are by the Seaside at a resort. We see a dentist who allows us to use his sailboat while he is away. Also borrow some of his other things. I think I am teaching, not sure. At one point there are a lot of people waiting for Frank, but when I arrive they want to hear me! I overhear Wendy and Bruce talking: he says he could take courses at this place, all those marked with "Z." He outlines his program so they could be together. All the while Wendy is working away at her sculpture and then Bruce says he was only joking. Not sure of the outcome for them. See the sailboat being hauled out from behind bushes.
