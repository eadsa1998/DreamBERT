I tried to find my friends in the crowded hall, but got a seat in the front row. When the man moved over, I told him I was looking for my handbag. It had considerable money in it. Then I saw one of my friends and asked her if she had seen my bag. No but I had a phone call upstairs waiting for me. I wanted to hear the next speaker. She told me I was to wait until 10 a.m. to phone. The number was 35804. I began to dial it.
