Dad, Ezra, Mom, Nana and I went for a drive somewhere. The road got cloudy so we decided to walk. We had burgers from McDonald's. We had two each, except there were eight. After struggling our way through the bush, we came to a clearing. This guy was in a car and he told us he'd kill us if we didn't hand over the burgers. Dad handed over four and I hid the rest. The guy ate two and got out of the car to do something. I ate my two burgers then gave Mom and Nana one each. The guy brought us to this place where he lived. There were caves and tents for houses. There were quite a few people there. They kept getting people and either eating or killing them or keeping them. The people I remember were Scott, who was the guy from the car, Dylan and David (who was in love with this girl that they had kept) and the girl that David liked. Scott ended up letting us go and Dylan, David and the girl as well. I wanted Scott to come (because he was hot) but I didn't say anything. We were then on a bus. David and the girl were cuddling and kissing. Dylan wanted to do the same thing with me and when I refused he talked to someone else. I was dressed in a costume. There was this doll in a dress and this little girl wanted to play with it. She said that she was "five, not two". There were older kids on the bus too. I saw The Graduate at a video shop. The end was actually people burning on a cross.
