BJ was spending the night with me. I was in bed already and asleep. She had gone out for the evening and I heard her come in, lock, and chain the door. I thought that I should have given her the passcode but then didn't think anymore of it. I heard her in the office, as though she was getting ready for bed. I thought that I should get up and help her get the bed down, get her bed ready. There was a futon in there and I wasn't sure she would know how to lay the futon down. I wanted her to be comfortable so I was going to go in and lay it down for her. I called for her from bed but I don't think she heard me. So I got up and as I headed towards the office I called for her again once or twice and didn't hear a response. I said I'm calling because I don't want to frighten you. I couldn't see very well so I went back into my bedroom and got my flashlight and went back in. Then I realized she wasn't in there. She must have gone downstairs. I started straightening the office, moving some papers around and reorganizing some binders and such to make more room for her. She had laid her watch and something else on the floor so I picked them up and set them on a table where I had just made room. Just as I was about ready to lay the futon down I realized that I should just have her sleep in Matthew's room. That bed is ready and she would be more comfortable in there anyway. I was going to tell her that and I heard her downstairs talking to someone. It seems that it was someone who works for me and is always there at night. I heard that woman say that it was nice to have someone there at that time of night - someone to talk to. She was just being very friendly. She was a very large black woman.
