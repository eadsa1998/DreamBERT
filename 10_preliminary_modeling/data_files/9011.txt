I am standing in a small front yard of a home. The grass is emerald green. It is surrounded by a fence, similar to a picket fence, but not quite the same. I am standing about twelve or so feet from the house facing away from it. There is a beautiful, mature tree to my right, slightly in front of me. Someone is with me and says something to me.
