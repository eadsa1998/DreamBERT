I dreamed that Norma (18), a girl who resides in the same dormitory as I, and I decided to change rooms. I was going to take the room I had last year and she was going to take my present room. I packed some of my things in a suitcase and went down to my old room. However, the present occupant of the room hadn't removed her things from the room. Since I had no place to put my things, I took my suitcase and went back to my present room. There I saw Norma had already moved in. She had changed some of the furniture around and was standing by the window ironing. I told her I couldn't get back my old room and she only laughed. I started to take her clothes out of the drawer and to put them in her suitcase. She had a lot of money lying on top of the dresser, which I also removed and put in the suitcase.
