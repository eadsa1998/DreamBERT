["Poison frog prisoner bites me."] I am a judge in robes preceding over the court. The prisoner is a tree frog, very poisonous. He is sitting in a glass jar so I am safe. Only as I talk and question him, I see the glass barrier isn't really there and slowly he is slipping through. Suddenly he springs at me attacking me. I leave the chambers and go to a side room where the Doctor comes to give the medicine which will counteract the poison. He has many different kinds of pills. There is sorting of the pills, and confusion on which ones to take and how many. I have difficulty swallowing them. My throat seems dry.
