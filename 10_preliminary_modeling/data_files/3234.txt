I am late for class and am rushing. Another woman is with me. We have a very fat, little obnoxious boy with us who we have to take care of. We decide to take him to the school daycare center. We know we'll meet resistance. The two women see us coming. "I suppose you will tell us this is our fault, that we forgot the phone call you made to reserve his space." I say honestly, "No, we didn't call. We need your help." They refuse us, no room. I turn to the other woman, whose responsibility this really is and say, "I'm sorry, but I must leave this to you and go on to my class." I feel bad, but I must do it. I resolutely do so, handing her this fat boy (maybe 2 years old) even though I feel guilty. I leave her and get to the class. The time has been changed and 1:50 time shows on the clock. The room is already full. I put my classwork, which I am excited about and feel is good work, down in a small spot and stand. There is no place to sit. The instructor (male) comes over to see my work.
