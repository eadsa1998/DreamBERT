I was at Nana's. Last time we were up there I had started making some dessert but had stuffed up and didn't finish. I had some game with recipes for a cake. We came up with the ingredients for it. I tried again and it was stirring, but it was just pink and white lollies in there. I realized I forgot flour and milk and all the important stuff. I asked Nana for a bunch of ingredients (eggs etc). Dad was annoyed at me because he wanted to leave. There was some show where they tested if talking to plants helped or not. One of the girls on it had lost half her weight and was embarrassed to go on. She actually didn't and went on the show.
