I'm driving a motorcycle on a crowded highway. The bike is brand new and looks futuristic, like out of a videogame or Anime. The piece of highway we're driving on looks very familiar to a piece of highway that connects my hometown to another city. It's long and straight and uphill. Every time I reach the top of this hill, though, it sort of just levels off and I'm immediately going uphill again on the same piece of highway I started driving on. The first two times I drive this stretch of road, it's relaxing, but the third time something clicks in my mind and I become "lucid". I realize "I've done this before; I'm dreaming this. I actually get to drive this bike!" I punch the accelerator and I begin weaving in and out of cars. And out of nowhere many more bikes appear and now I'm in some sort of videogame style race. There's a big turn, a left turn that comes so fast that even though I try to turn, I still hit it. But I hit it in slow motion and the side of my bike slams into the guardrail and bunches of the rival bikes shoot past me. Still lucid, I try to turn the accelerator on the handle, but nothing happens and I wake up.
