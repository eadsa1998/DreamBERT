I need to go to the bathroom and go looking for a bathroom. I don't find one and have to go badly. I bend down near a fireplace in a sort of church lobby/activity room. I am standing in a foot of water, and as I pee, the sound of water rushing is very loud. I notice some churchgoers peering in through the window at me and seeing me, but I can't stop. It rushes out in torrents and goes on a long time. The people remind me of Hillary and Charles.
