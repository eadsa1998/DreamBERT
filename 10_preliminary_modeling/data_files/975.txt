It's a hot day. I'm traveling through hot and dusty lands. There are lots of steep hills. I see a river. I take all may clothes off and get in the river and swim up stream. The current gets faster and harder. The water boils around. I go around a corner and see a huge waterfall. It looks like thick plastic. I feel stopped. I struggle to the side bank and sit on the rocks. I hide myself because I'm naked. I call out to Dwight to help me. I exclaim about the waterfall. He comes and looks at it. I ask him, "What are we going to do?" He goes to investigate. Then, I have to cook a dinner for a very authoritarian dad. Dwight gives me directions. I resent having to do things the way the dad dictates. Dad apparently told Dwight and Dwight told me. A younger sister questioned if she could go to store to get milk and we all gasp at her because dad would be angry if he heard her innocently talk about buying impulsively. One waits for sales and buys in weekly or monthly lots to save money. I open a drawer. I find lots and lots of spaghetti noodles. I am going to peel potatoes and look for some fresh potatoes. All I find are rotten old ones. I feel angry and resentful. I look out the window. I see a lighthouse. It is short and fat. I say, "Oh, has it the old lantern in it?" I then laugh and answer myself, "Probably not. They aren't used anywhere any more. It's a shame." Some man is watching us. I plop the dishes on the table, 3 plates. One for dad, one for Lydia, and one for myself. We sit at a huge table. Dwight sits where dad should be. I look startled and then see he's sitting next to dad's place. My plate is accidently too close to dad's plate. I get angry and grab it and move it to my place. The man watches. It's like I'm temperamental and capable of standing up to this dad and he's curious if I'm going to blow up or if I'll just keep all that resentment inside. I feel fake nonchalance. I grumble and say smart things but I don't directly blow up. I feel close to it.
