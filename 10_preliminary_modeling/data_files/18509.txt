I was at a protest and a guy was teaching me how to instigate riots. There were 2 horses for us to use and the one for me was very hoppy. HOPPY and fun. To start riots we needed paintbrushes. The first one for me had dried up paint and the bristles were stuck together and to something. Evelyn came and said (that) she had to go swing dancing, 'cause she got a new T-shirt with fringes. And I said, " Evelyn, I don't know if they wore tacky shirts like for swing dancing." And she said, "That's O.K., I've got to wash it first."
