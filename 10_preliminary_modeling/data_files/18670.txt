I was in Spectra. I was looking for 11" x 14" and 8" x 10" plastic sheets. And contact sheet plastics. I needed some sharpies and a phone machine tape and some make-up and the Asian girl I'd met at class put them on the counter. I taped the pens to my knuckles. She brought 3 packs of contact sheet covers and I told her I only needed one pack, and the 8" x 10", 11" x 14" plastics. Finally I got them exchanged and sat at the bar stool there smoking over the counter. I had a bunch of rose thorns (no flowers) and wadded up used tape to my left, sitting on the bar stool. The thorns were poking into the plastic so I squished the sticky tape till it stuck underneath he counter and I stuck the thorns to the tape. Jasmine had a huge picture of puppies. It was B/W beautiful with the little black dogs in the center. It was for the front page. She used a filter that would make them pop more, the girl who brought me the stuff only charged me $5.84, I just didn't say anything about the other stuff, because she'd skated out on her break. A man's dead mother, Maxine, called. I talked to her son, who was alive, and annoying, and I told him I was on a borrowed cell phone in a store and I had to stop talking because the batteries might go dead. It was costing her money, this talk.
