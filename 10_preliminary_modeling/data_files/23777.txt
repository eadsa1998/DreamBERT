I was back hiking in the canyons in Utah, somewhere near Moab.  It was beautiful and wild.  Just red rock, river, cliffs, and winding canyons.  I had to climb up a rock overhang.  There was some problem or danger in the climb.  One or two other people were with me, but we were the only people out there.  I was exhilarated and energized, being back in the desert, in the canyons, touching rocks.  We had a long hike.  Later in the dream I was at a party.  There were drugs.  There was that drug-feeling among the people: over-focused, over-talking, jazzed with detail and heightened meaning.  Small hallways with wood walls or cupboards.  And some danger there, about being caught or some conspiracy between the people there, not too sure now what the exact danger was.
