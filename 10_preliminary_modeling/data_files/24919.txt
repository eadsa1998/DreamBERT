I was in this weird building, with a few friends. We were all just talking and hanging out, when all of the sudden this weird shadow appears on the wall. Then these ghost-like creatures came flying at us. We tried to call our parents, but the phone was dead. Setting: A room. Characters: A lot of kids, but I don't know them in real life. Feelings and Thoughts: Worried. I didn't know what was happening &amp; if I would ever get out.
