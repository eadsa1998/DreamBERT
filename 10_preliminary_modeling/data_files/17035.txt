My baby daughter is running down a hill - she's initially on the pavement, but then she strays into the road. I'm at the bottom of the hill watching in horror as a car comes down the hill behind her. I run screaming up the hill in direct view of the car waving my arms - I'm not sure if the car has seen her. The car stops in time. I grab my daughter who is laughing.
