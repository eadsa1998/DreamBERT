I can't remember how or when or why, but somebody in my dream was trying to tell me the HIV virus was responsible for causing my underdeveloped optic nerve, and that it was going to spread to the rest of my body sometime in my life, and it was going to turn into AIDS. I actually believed it for the duration of the dream, and it wasn't really all that scary, but then again it kind of was a little bit. And I can't remember anything else that was going on in the dream, but there was a whole bunch of other stuff that wasn't related. But I don't remember any more of it, because, like I said before, I let this go like this is the evening time now, and it stayed with me this whole day. But that's that. It was really, really crazy. Then, as I was waking up, I was thinking how that probably wasn't true, but until I was really awake, I couldn't be absolutely sure.
