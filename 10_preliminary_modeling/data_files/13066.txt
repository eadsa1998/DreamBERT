I did drama, as did Calvin, for semester two and we had it in the chemistry room. I didn't like it. I complained to Mom. I had to do some project on Cleopatra. Dad and Darren were there. Darren and Mom were both on the computer. This police woman came and she asked me I was Izzy Conell. Dad said no, but Mom gave it away. Later, Mom said my name and I said I wanted to go home, because I didn't want to have to talk to the police lady.
