It was announced that Aloha Hour would be across the street. I went out by the front entrance and went to the corner where I could see the entrance by which Mrs. C. would leave but she didn't come. She might have left earlier not having seen me in my usual seat for I had sat near the center aisle. I started walking, missed my Bible and went back for it. The church was now empty but on a post of the stairway was a paper parcel. I looked in and there was my Bible. Saw the janitor at a distance and waved it to him to show him I had found it.
