I was taking another IB course somewhere else incase I failed at Westland. Ezra was doing it too. Ms Myzshka was on the teacher list. The class was big.  The first assignment was a speech and we had to introduce ourselves. It was Wednesday and I was missing out on the MUPC to be there. I decided to leave. I text Mom but then went to Westland by myself. I was one hour early so I decided to skip it altogether.
