A rescue mission.  Snuck into a house that looked like my maternal Grandma Jane's owned by an old man, and had to hide in plain sight several times.  Had to find a silver pen and a phone number. I was found, and poked the man in the eyes, and repeatedly slammed his head against the floor in the kitchen.  I and the others ran down the street to a shrubbed safe house.  There were people behind cars arguing.
