I was back in Austria as an American Army captain on a return trip after a lapse of several years (number of years not clear and location in Austria not clear). Everything was recognizable, but no names were clear. I recognized faces of the men and was welcomed and questioned about the U.S. Now, however, many soldiers had their wives there, and there were vases of flowers on tables, and carpets on the floors of the billets, and curtains at the window. My driver had told me where an old friend was staying, and I was on my way to his house when the dream stopped. His name was the only clear one (Lt. John Nagle) and he had been a close buddy through some bitter combat days.
