I just woke up from a very strange dream. One of the strangest that I've ever had in my life I think. We were somewhere, like part of my mind says it was part of the grounds of the Redwood school and something else says we were somewhere visiting. I guess there was a great many people around and there was seemed like there were lots of activities around everywhere. And the animals, there were a lot of animals around, like there was a circus there. And the elephant was there of course being at a circus, and we had to walk through the feeding area of this elephant and they were saying "That's all right, you can wash off your shoes because the area was...they said that the elephants were eating something like butter, or mashed potatoes and gravy...But you knew while you were walking that you were walking in this really slippery kind of stuff that was a type of thing that you just knew that you had to get your shoes cleaned and they said, "don't worry about it" and we walked for quite a while in this mess and when we came out of it I heard the elephant making that sound, that trumpeting. It didn't seem to bother anybody, it was just there and there was a lot of activity around and it seemed like there was music in the background and everything but I guess the strangest thing about the dream was where we had to walk and it was almost as if we had to walk through some of the waste materials too that the elephant would leave.
