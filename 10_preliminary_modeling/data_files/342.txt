I'm in the diner across from the library eating a "Veggie-Burger" with some other people. They all get finished and go, but there's one woman still here, and she says, "How can you eat that? Whenever I eat any kind of meat I just get sick", and I'm really startled. I thought this was a veggie/soy patty of some sort, and I scrape the melted cheese off (rather a lot, a white cheese with bits of peppers and other veg in it) and examine the patty closely - by George it looks like hamburger - thin, but hamburger - and I pull it apart with my fingers to see if it feels like meat. It does. I take it up to the counter. The woman there isn't the regular person but I show her and complain, "How can you do this? This is hamburger! What a rotten thing to do!" She's somewhat taken aback but doesn't say anything. In the back of my mind I've been thinking they must have thought they could call it "Veggie-Burger" if they just put vegetable things on top.
