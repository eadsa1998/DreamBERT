It is related to the execution of the Cajamarca murderer, since it was I who was going to get shot. But I was already dead. I was inside a coffin and I thought about how they could kill me if I was already dead. I was dead, but I saw and heard everything the others did. Then I saw myself struggling desperately to get out of the coffin. I screamed and cried to open the coffin, but I was already buried and they had covered me with dirt. This is what was happening when I woke up and the dream ended. The dream frightened me at every point and most of all I felt guilty, because I was the one who had committed the crime.
