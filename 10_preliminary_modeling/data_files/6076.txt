I remember being at some sort of a fundraiser. It was a black tie event! The one part of the evening I remember was during one dance. People were to join hands on the dance floor and sort of sway back and forth in a circle. I had two friends on either side of me. And the both of them did not want to hold the guy's hand that was next to them. They wanted me to get between them and the guys. They were squirming away. But I had no problem with it at all! After a while one of the girls, Jean, held the guy's hand after all.
