It was short: I was in need of money and suddenly I remembered that I had $100 or more in a savings account, but I didn't want to withdraw from there. I found a lost billfold and when I opened it, I found that there was a roll of bills. There were $1,000 dollars. I spent them, and it turned out that the money belonged to my mother.
