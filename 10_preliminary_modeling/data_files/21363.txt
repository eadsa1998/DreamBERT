I heard in my sleep, "2-2, 2pp. 1st.r and 2-2nd race." I was driving my car. A kid pushed a pile of cans in front of me and when my car hit the cans, it stopped dead and I hit the steering wheel with my stomach and I sort of knocked myself out for a while. I noticed I had the traffic blocked as I went around the car. A cow or bull was biting my hand, then it hit for my face and it held my breath as it got close to my face and I awoke.
