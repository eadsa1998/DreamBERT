I was playing with my brother and he was running after me, teasing me. I tried to escape him and fell down on the stairs--oddly made out of green jello which started to shake. After that, I found myself back in my country in the apartment of a young married couple, friends of ours, and saw their newborn baby. I wanted to call my mother to tell her that I was back, but I spent a whole hour and could not correctly dial our number. I knew it but always something prevented me from dialing it right, and I was extremely upset. Finally my mother called our friends, and I answered the phone and felt a great relief, but I did not know how to get home and was mixed up in the buses and subways.
