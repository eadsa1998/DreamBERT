I was at my friend's house and we were working on some sort of difficult long-lasting project which we never seemed to finish. Her computer didn't have the right software for the graph program that we needed, so we were asking all of the families on the block if they had it. When we got it, we wanted to put smiley faces on top of our graphs! Setting: At my friend's house, but it was slightly deformed. Characters: My friend, her mom and dad, me, her little brother, her friends and their parents. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy. My friend and I finished our project awhile ago, and we didn't use smiley-faces, and we always had the right software.
