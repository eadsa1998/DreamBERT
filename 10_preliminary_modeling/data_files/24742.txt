I was at Hashy camp in Australia, and we were going to do this activity called the field game. It was freezing cold so Adam and I went into our dark room, to change. We tried to turn on the lights, but there was no switch that we could find. There were a bunch of weird things that we tried to switch, but the best we did was dimming green lights around the room. The problem? They only stayed dimmed. One time, I tried to find a switch and by accident rubbed my hand over some wires. I thought I would get electrocuted, but I didn't. I finally got changed in the dark. The game started by this boy catapulting a big stone off a cliff, and these big men had to hold him back from falling off the cliff. Setting: Hashy camp, out of Melbourne, Australia. Characters: My brother - not very helpful, usually. Feelings and Thoughts: Frustrated. It was actually kind of what happened at Hashy camp, but no green lights. What I mean is that the light switches were hard to find and there was a "field game."
