We are either on a holiday, or in some kind of sanatorium. At any rate, in this dream I know Mary is ill and we are not able to (or we are not permitted to?) make love, or even allowed to tell each other that we love one another. I'm sort of lying down or am in a sitting position where I'm looking up at Mary. It is hard to tell whether we are indoors or outdoors, but it is very bright and sunny. Mary is standing, looking up at the sun. Her hands are raised above her head as though she is reaching for the sky. She is looking up, but her eyes are closed, and she is making low sounds, like she's praying. At the same time, she is doing a slow, weaving dance as though she is making a supplication to God. I have a strong desire to hold her and I do so. I stand up, put my arms around her and begin to kiss her face, eyes, cheeks, neck and her breasts. But all the while she continues her slow, sinuous dance with her head and arms uplifted, chanting what I believe to be prayers - and completely oblivious to me. I joined the dance in order to hold on to her - to kiss her.
