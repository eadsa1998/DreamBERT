I am meeting my director in a department store. I get into an elevator and it isn't working properly, missing the exact mark to stop, so he decides to fix the thing while we are on it, which makes me a bit nervous. Now we go to an area to rehearse and basically he hands me the pages for the scene and talks me through the summary of what happens. Then I need to go to the bathroom and find one and pee. Now it is almost time for my scene. I feel a bit insecure because I might lose the lines. I have a few seconds of almost a panic feeling and then calm down and go. I am playing a silly director and wear a green beret and a butch short haircut, with pretty-colored gray and black hair like Mirabelle. I ham it up, making funny faces and following my director, who is also acting a part around the set because I realize we've never worked the blocking. Now the audience gets very vocal and noisy until we have to stop. I look out at them and they are fighting amongst themselves. We wait for a while, watching. They are seated like in a church balcony, and a bunch in the back, mostly men are standing and pushing and shoving and yelling. Then I see way up at the top, three or four rows of the young girls in communion dresses all leaving. Now they calm down a bit and I say to my director, "I'm going to go get my script because we've really had no rehearsal or blocking," and he agrees. I rush backstage to find the pages and am looking through a pile on a bed, couch thing. Another more veteran actress is saying something and I say, "You must help me find my script first because I'm on now. It's in a white folder." She agrees and I find the pages, feeling a bit bad about not being prepared, but OK because It wasn't my fault and we'll get through this OK. I go back on stage, looking at my director to help me know where to restart the scene.
