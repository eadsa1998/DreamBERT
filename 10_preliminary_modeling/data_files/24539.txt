I'm walking in the big yard of my grammar school. I'm just leaving when two people who work there pass by. One of them, a black man, is wearing a starched Army fatigue shirt, buttoned at the collar. I want to tell him it looks silly, but I say nothing. I walk past someone who knows me. He begins to say my name loudly, then goes quiet. I warn him not to give me away. I tell him I know that the two people want to kill me. I tell him I'm going to tell the police, who will come here and arrest them. Recollection ends here.
