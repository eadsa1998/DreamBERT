I was seated at a card table playing poker with three other men. I was losing and felt that I should be winning. I had the impression that the game was unfair. In fact I was the only one losing. The other three men had lower cards than I did, but for some reason I was letting them take the money. They were kidding me about it and I was getting mad. On the next deal I showed everyone my cards, which were the highest on the table, but the other three men took the money and divided it among themselves. I once again showed them my cards and asked why I could not take the money. They gave no answer. I then picked up an ashtray from the table and started threatening them. In a fit of anger I threw it at a cat that suddenly appeared in the room. I hit the cat and felt relieved. The other three men excused themselves and left the room. I was looking for an answer as to how I could get my money back, but I never found one. The dream ended.
