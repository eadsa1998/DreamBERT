I was at Mom's in the toilet which had a single bed in there. I was complaining. She then said that she would put the toilet back. Later, I was in my room and I was watching Big. Tom Hanks and Elizabeth Perkins were in a pool. Elizabeth had a husband and dismissed Tom. He turned into a kid and then turned back.
