 There is a small gathering that seems to be at Hill Park in Oak Valley. People have the option of seeing some kind of show. If they see the show they must laugh at it all, even if it isn't very funny. There are some Chinese people who toast their friend or relative who is on stage. My high school classmate Muriah Dinks is there. She chases me around flirtatiously. I escape from her into a bathroom. I urinate for a long time. There is the threat of her entering the bathroom because she knows I'm the only person in it. In a smaller group two people are naked and are having sex in an odd position.
