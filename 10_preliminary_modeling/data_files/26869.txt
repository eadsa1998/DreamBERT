 I'm traveling north on horses with my housemate Stephen Ramos and a second person, who may be my housemate Hank Anderson. At some point I think the second person I'm with is a woman. We're near the artic circle. When we get to a certain point, which may be the northernmost island in the world, we get off our horses. We let our horses go when we get there. The horses, which I see as a metal radio-controlled car-like object, continue to go north. We turn back, walking on the ice and packed snow. We jump over ravines, snow chunks squishing beneath our feet. Some of the snow slides, breaking off in a small avalanche. The woman is swept down into a v-shaped ravine. Stephen is swept after her, but not as far. I tell him I'll grab his hat, which has fallen off. I do, then slide down the ravine to help the woman. I grab her hand. She has trouble getting her footing as I haul her up. Her feet slip on the snow. The snow is then gone in that area, and she slides down a rock ledge. She catches her footing on a rock just above the water. We make it back to the ending place. There are three people, including my friend Kevin Simpson, there that I know. I'm happy to return. I'm very tired. My greeting with the two others is lukewarm, but with Kevin my greeting is strong, excited, and happy.
