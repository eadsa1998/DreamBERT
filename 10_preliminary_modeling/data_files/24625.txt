I was at a sewing class and you picked out your design on the computer. The lady that was teaching us how to sew took me outside. We started running around the town. It was getting dark and I got scared that I would never see my parents again. But the lady brought me back to a room that my family was in. Setting: It took place at a sewing class outside. Characters: There were people in my dream (sewing teacher, family). I knew almost all of them. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, scared. At first I was happy, but then I got scared.
