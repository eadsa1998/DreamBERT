It's during WorldWar II. I'm being treated like a princess because it's my birthday coming up. Everything seems to be going my way - focused on me - very smooth. Lots of events planned throughout the week. Jeff S. is asking around about who wants to go to Paris to cook. Me, me, me - but he kind of ignores me and only talks about it with the everyone else. I'm living in this kind of large building with different wings and guests are staying all over the place. I climb around it like it's a jungle jim. On the day before my birthday they are having bands play in a concert barrack across the way. I kind of dont want to go - I want to go to Paris. But I go with my camera. It's a long hall and is set up to have about 3-4 bands. There are 3-4 stages going all the way down. One band starts playing. I start shooting but people are rushing over and getting in the way of every shot. Another band is setting up so I go over. They are all females. I start shooting again but my camera keeps freezing and all the audience rushes over again (they are also all females) leaving the other band to play to no one. <br/
