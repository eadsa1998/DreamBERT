["Overdose."] I am in a hospital bed. It is early morning and I am being admitted to have surgery. A nurse comes in and gives me a purple pill. Another one comes in and gives me 2 more of them. I say to her, after I've taken them, I already had one. I realize I'm overdosed. She assures me I am safe. She says I will just sleep real good. I become very sleepy. There are photos of ancient relatives on the bed table. They belong to the previous patient. Her family comes in to gather her things. I point out the letter and the cigs are hers also. I guess I'm having my surgery and hope no more mistakes will be made. I am worried but am compelled to sleep by the meds.
