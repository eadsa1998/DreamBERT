Ezra, Roland and I were at this school place. There were five levels for each grade. They were in Year 9, in the easiest one to escape. Year 11 and 12 had too many bars. People were leaning out of holes? Outside somewhere, Ezra swapped something with another person for long guns. Mom and I gave him a permanent marker. I had to leave for some academic summit [I finished rewatching Freaks and Geeks yesterday]. Ezra and Roland wanted to leave, so I helped them escape and then a lady chased and caught us. I said I had to leave for the summit. She suggested that I call Mom so I did, but she didn't answer, and then I discovered she'd left her phone here. The lady was then Anastasia. Mom lived across the street, so I went over to give the phone to her and she came out and got it. I was watching the end of Freaks and Geeks and Lindsay dyed her hair blonde, which looked nice, but she was mean. I then decided to ditch the academic summit and follow a band.
