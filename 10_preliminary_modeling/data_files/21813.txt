We were in Carter's basement and he had three heads or three pictures of a man and said, "If you guess (he mentioned the name of a man whom I didn't know) the picture of the man, you will win $1800." I looked at them and thought, "If I guess the right one, I would win $1800 later." I made a guess and a bar was thrust in the hole of the mouth of one of the men and it fit, so I won. Then Carter tried one of the other pictures and it also fit, so I had a 2 to 1 chance to win. I heard full count. I can't recall clearly, but there was some sort of same name in syllables in the first and second race at Ascot Park.
