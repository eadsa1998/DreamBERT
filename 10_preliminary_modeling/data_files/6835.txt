Twice I had been told the old red dress would be all right but when I was about to get in the car, I insisted I must change as it wouldn't do. "Won't take me but two minutes." Hurried back thinking my blue and white narrow striped dress would do. But I had to stop and put peanut butter in a dish. When it was all in, found it was slopping over on the ground or table. I noticed specks of dirt or crumbs and several slices of stale bread mixed in it, pulled then and threw them in the garbage.
