This container thing was in space and 'fell' into this gravity thing which suspended it. This guy checked it and then turned it over and the gravity changed and it floated down to Earth. This alien thing was around. Some guy who looked like Jason Patric was there too. I was at school and I sat with Elana, then I was wondering why I was sitting with her and went over to the bench. A bunch of boys were near by and they were throwing ice-cream. Someone called out "Calvin". The boys left. Mr Willingham told them off. We were hiding out and Eugene kept hiding out. We were hiding because it was the end of the world or something.
