I dreamed I was back in the Marine Corps and it seems I was dug in with some of the guys I was in with before. We were just getting ready to move out when I found out that I didn't have any ammunition left. The word was passed to move out and I was still looking for ammunition. As we were running along and approaching the enemy I was getting panicky and I finally as we were upon the enemy, the dream ended.
