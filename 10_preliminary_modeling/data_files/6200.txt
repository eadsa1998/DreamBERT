I had a dream that I was younger. I was over at a friend's house during the summer. We (people I used to be friendly with) were playing gin by the pool. I remember that I wanted to go home. I kept looking at my watch. I saw on my watch that I did not have to stay much longer. They did not want me to leave because they could not continue to play gin. I wanted to go home but I did not want to say it to them. Then my alarm went off. I got out of that situation.
