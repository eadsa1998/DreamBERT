 I'm in a room fighting with a man. He may be my old classmate Binky Ahmed, Lyle Zeffman, or Daryl Yeller, who are all there. We each have a knife. We swing at each other many times, maybe slicing each other. I do not notice cuts if I get them. We are both more concerned with fatal injuries. I drop my knife so we can fight with our hands. I punch everyone, hitting them and moving on. I walk back to an area that enters into my uncle Gary Redding's farm. There are many kids outside, like recess. My classmate from Brimson, Kyle Mendelson, is there. Two boys throw a baseball. It's dangerous for them to do this, I think: the ball could hit some of the kids that are around. I walk up to the porch of the farmhouse. Gary comes down the stairs, and I go in. He doesn't recognize me, though he got a phone call saying I was coming. I say that I'm Natalie's son Kenneth. There are fish mounted on the walls that aren't as big as the ones Grandpa Redding had mounted when he was living there. Some of the fish look made up and fake: all colorful and plastic. There is a large piece of paper on the wall with sleeping arrangements written on it by grandpa Redding. It seems there is going to be a family reunion or gathering. I'm sleeping in the living room with my siblings. Gary's wife Carla Redding is there. She has short dark brown hair and looks very middle aged and plump.
