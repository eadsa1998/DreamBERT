Andy had his family come for a visit from Canada. When the government found out, they gave them maid service while they were here. Then all at once a cop came in and a cop of the olden days. It was Mr. Lasko. He was nervous and shaky. They got the orders to go home to Canada. They had to awake the kids early in the morning. It was still dark. When they were leaving, Grandpa Lasko ran over and kissed the man goodbye and then he ran over to the lady and kissed her goodbye. I was watching him from a lower level. As he walked, he was sort of shaky and walked like Charles Chaplin. Then he would stop and shake nervously. I was eating meat and I saw the fish bowl beer glasses they served. Ann got married to another man and still I was her husband. It was confusing. She got a postal card. It stated she would be home shortly.
