There was a robot guard lady. She was big, and made of iron. She was going after a sleeping friend in the blue-light-covered colder upstairs part of her house. It was difficult to defeat, because of its mass. I hit it, dented it, and smashed at it on every joint and from every angle. Eventually, it fell. I dodged its blows because it was slow. I hit it. But then it turned into a more feminine robot. It was still muscular, but somewhat attractive, with blonde hair and a pierced nose. It got even softer as I began to talk to it. It looked like the hot Krishna girl. It opened its legs and I began having sexual intercourse it. She said it was very enjoyable, because I was passionate, not self-centered.
