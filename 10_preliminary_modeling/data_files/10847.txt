At the beginning of this dream, I entered church and sat down next to the aisle. Then I started talking to an unknown lady next to me about a fellow in the choir (one whose name I do not know, but one whom I have wanted to meet). She proceeded to tell me what a fine person he was and then she got up and started to leave. I called after her and asked his name. She replied Roy Neru and then left. I continued then to watch him in the choir. Later in the dream I saw him in another part of the church and I was very disappointed with his build and stature--he was very short and extremely fat through the hips and waist.
