I checked the kick plate along the bottom of the refrigerator. Dreamed that the left side of the kickplate was broken and was hanging by a thread and to the point that it couldn't be put on. In reality it is breaking and I have a replacement downstairs to use when it does break. It was so vivid. I pictured myself in our kitchen looking at the kickplate, that is examining it by touch, and the piece was just hanging by a piece of plastic. It was very real. One of the most real dreams I remember having. Nothing was out of place.
