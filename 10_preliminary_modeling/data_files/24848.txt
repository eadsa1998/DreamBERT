I was with my family. We went to buy something at a store and I found this CD I kind of wanted so I put it in a bag. Then I tried on these ugly rainbow-colored shoes. I put these in a bag. Later, we're driving and I see that I have stolen both these things, which I didn't mean to do. Then we see some black gangsters fighting and my mom sighs, "please don't start." Then they start punching people out and Tupac gets rolled in front of our car &amp; starts screaming something at us. Setting: In a shoe/CD store. Also on a street from a car-windshield point of view. Characters: My family in the dream was just a generic family, I don't know them. Tupac is a famous rapper who died. He had some good songs. The gangsters were random, but one was Snoop Doggy Dog (also a famous rapper but he's alive). Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, worried, indifferent. Well, yesterday I was looking at pictures of Snoop Doggy Dogg and Tupac. Even though in my dream Tupac looked nothing like Tupac, Snoop Doggy Dogg looked the same.
