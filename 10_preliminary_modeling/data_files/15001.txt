I think I was someone else. I was with a friend outside and I realized there were zombies. I took a car and drove off. My friend realized and she caught up with me. I had a boyfriend in another city. I drove to the beach and there was a guy with a boat. I went on and got across.  Then I was driving on the road in the other city. An ambulance kept trying to knock us off the road and after passing us, turned back around to get us. The streets were full of cars and it was night. I pushed past some cars and drove to this building and ran inside and we split up. It was a place for poor people and there were lots of people inside. The next day, police came looking for us. My friend was now Ben (Lost). There was a close up of his face and he looked creepy and fat. The zombies were smart and ended up taking over.
