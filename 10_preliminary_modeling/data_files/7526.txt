I am in bed, and Mary is in another bed. These beds are at right angles to each other at their heads. I can see Mary's face. She is sleeping soundly and peacefully and looks lovely -- as she did before the illness. My radio is at the head of my bed (either in the wall, or on my bed). Something is wrong with it and I'm trying to fix it by fiddling with the dials. But it is dark and I can't see what I'm doing. I need light, but don't want to turn on the overhead light fixture lest I awaken Mary. Mary looks good. I can see her "full face," just as I remembered her when she used to take a nap on our sofa. she looks lovely, resting comfortably and relaxed.
