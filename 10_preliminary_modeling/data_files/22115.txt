It was a beautiful party with lots of noise. The band played constantly and everyone danced without pause. A beautiful girl attracted me and I looked at her, without taking my eyes from her for a moment, a long while. I liked her so, so much that later I was married and living in a mansion and I had lots of money and properties. My two children looked like me. My mother was visiting me and she cried when she told about the time I was born and grew up at her side.
