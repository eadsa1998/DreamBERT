I am across the street, in our neighbor's. She has several small children - one is a pretty blonde girl who I make a fuss over. (This is the house I was born in). I am tearing up bread crumbs (I had to do this in cooking class today and remembered doing it for my mother). The little girl wanted me to come &amp; play but I couldn't because a fellow I date was upstairs in the bathroom, and I was waiting for him. Finally fellow came down - he had become someone else.* He came in, grasping neighbor's hand, &amp; her father's hand, firmly. From then on he seems to wander, being either L. or P. without much discrimination. The little blonde girl &amp; her sister &amp; 2 brothers are going to a party, and leave, all bundled up. They all disappear - trouping into the fraternity house across the street - blonde leading.
