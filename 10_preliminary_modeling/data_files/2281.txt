It is Willie's funeral and I am coming in. As I get to the door, I am standing with a guy who looks like Nat Ivy of LLG and like Willie. He's cute to look at, but he keeps embarrassing me with his outrageous comments. He looks in at the gathered people through the glass windows. He says, "Look at those niggers." I am scandalized and shush him. He points to the black people in the back row. He and I walk in. I'm kind of cuddled up to him and following where he goes. He goes to the front of the room and dances in a closet with skeleton/Star War troopers. It's kind of kinky, sexy. I am embarrassed. He gets out and we walk around to the back of the room. We watch an instant review of a video where this blonde guy comes in and realizes Willie is dead and he yells and sobs, "No! No! It isn't possible!" He's embarrassed he was caught off guard. I see my cousin Dora seated facing us, people around her. I want to join her but can't because this is Willie's funeral and yet I am with an alive Willie. We sit down on a side bench and play silly "lover" games with our hands, like we can't touch each other and then accidentally touch and hold hands and then break away, giggling. We repeat that over and over.
