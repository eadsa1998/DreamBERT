I am in a house. Each room is small and compact, so I don't have to expend energy moving around. When I sit on my bed, I lean over to the dresser to get my clothes. There are shelves above the dresser. The bathroom is a small room off the bedroom. Then there are a series of small rooms in a row - a laundry room, a garden. Then a woman comes in. I am setting up a VCR to look over our work. A man, two men come in, one is my "husband." They want us to move so they can use the VCR. I get very angry because we were here first. I refuse to leave. The other woman cajoles me to leave. She says it's no big deal to us and would mean so much to them. I disagree and argue all the way out. I point out that the man is being manipulative; he has a room of his own and a working VCR. The man wants his credit cards back and I think about hiding them and keeping them.
