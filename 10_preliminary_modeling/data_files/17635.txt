A 3-inch tall deer came into my boyfriend Jeremy's room. It was really cute.  I held it and such, but we didn't think it was safe, so took it to the zoo. They didn't want to accept it because care costs money. So we'd have to pay them, but would eventually yield a profit. The deer was small, so we just snuck it through the bars. At that point it was actually a little lizard wearing a horse blanket. Then there was a chimp, and the zoo was asking an exorbitant amount for it too...So Jeremy came up with this brilliant little scam. He wrote a computer program. I don't remember it exactly but there was some sort of robotic thing, and a spray. We were in this Icelandic world. Off in the snow someone was pushing on the rump of a rhino or wildebeest while the polar bears just sat around. Well someone was driving on the ice and it cracked, and Jeremy's spray came to the rescue and the plan was going to work.
