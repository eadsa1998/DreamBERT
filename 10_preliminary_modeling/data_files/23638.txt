I'm being sued for malpractice because of sexual misconduct. All accusations have been disproven. We are in Leiden, my alma mater. There are students who come to my aid and there especially is one young man who is coming to my door. At first I have seen him standing near the canal along the Academy building. He stands outside and I let him in. Then others enter as well. One is an extremely brilliant one I trained with whom I envied. A young woman from law school says, "The time you didn't work is lost. You will not be reimbursed. But there will not be a criminal or civil suit. The case is probably going to be thrown out."
