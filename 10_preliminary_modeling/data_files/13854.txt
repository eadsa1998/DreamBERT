I started a new account on Runescape to see what it was like for new members now. The skills only showed up when you talked to a tutor for that skill. I was telling Ezra. Then it was Dad's work (I wasn't there) and Gunther hadn't come in and he was due for his shift hours ago. He was getting worried and then he came in, drunk. Dad got home late with some random movies, including Singing in the Rain.
