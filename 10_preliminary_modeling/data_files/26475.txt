 I walk on a bunch of tennis courts. My friend Melanie McDyss is playing a game of tennis next to me. I'm going to play a game with my brother Wally, it seems. Wally goes to grab some tennis rackets form inside. Then it seems I'm playing with my schoolmate Reed Maxwell. A fat man and his son come up to me before we start playing, before my partner has returned. They tell me they have an appointment to play at 6:30, to take up seven or ten courts for a big game. It's 6:15 now. I tell them I'm sorry, and I try to accommodate them at first so they can play and we can keep the court. They become rude and belligerent. I tell them to give me some respect. The son is big and fat and strong. He starts pushing me. I turn away, and I think and say, "What are you doing?!?" This guy is a big, dumb, ignorant, foolish idiot. My uncle Rusty Redding is in the background watching this guy push me. I don't push back because I think it is inane and uncivilized.
