I am talking to the baby's father who I am now estranged from. I think we are in the big city. Other friends of ours are around and he goes to play video games with a close friend of both of ours who I dated before him. I then walked around the building (which I do not recognize) looking as if I had lost something. The lighting is hazy and the scene is in color and soft focus. I remember talking to other people and feeling frustrated (I do not recall the details of any of the conversation, but I do remember trying to see into the room where my friends disappeared).
