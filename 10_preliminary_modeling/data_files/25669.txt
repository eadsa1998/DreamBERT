 There is a river by a mountain. Homer and Bart Simpson get buried in the mountain. I'm with my roommate Stephen Ramos and my friends Kevin Simpson, Kristy Puffy, and Kevin's mother Karen Simpson. There is something valuable in the mountain. We have three necklaces that allow us to breath underwater. I give my necklace to the others. I have a "Sluuu necklace", which is mine. I give it to Kevin so he can breath underwater. Kevin comes back and says there is air in the mountain! I swim, following him under stairs in the water. I go through a narrow tunnel area. There are spikes in the tunnel. I have trouble holding my breath. I imagine the inside of the mountain to be like a treasure.
