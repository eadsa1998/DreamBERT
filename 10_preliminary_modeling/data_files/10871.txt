I seemed to be in a strange city with my skating partner to participate in a skating competition. At the hotel I was surprised to find that my partner (33-year-old male) had a three-room suite while I had only one room which I did not see. I was admiring his suite which seemed to be furnished in old-fashioned taste (like his home really) and was inspecting the things that belonged to him (as I have done in his home). After a while we began to wrestle playfully and I kept wishing it would turn into love-making (as I often wish actually), but it didn't (it never does in real life either).
