I was in class, in Math 102, and the professor called me to the blackboard; and since I couldn't solve the problem well, he had to help me. At the end, he told me that he was going to raise me two points and he continued calling on people. He called on a girl that knew nothing and she was embarrassed and she blushed, and all of us whistled at her until she left the room.
