I return home after being gone for a few days. Dovre and Ellie are there, Ellie is a young adult, Dovre is maybe 7 or 10 years old. I ask several times, "Where is Paulina?" They don't answer and finally I get worried. I demand to know where Paulina is. Ellie flirts with a young adult native American man, pulls his waist belt and they walk off. I realize Paulina is in trouble and Ellie is refusing to answer to me. I yell at her and demand to know. She just leaves with her man. I realize she is going to marry him and I don't even care to rescue her. My concern is Paulina. I ask Dovre who finally says Paulina is in the hospital and so is Charla because Ellie abandoned them without food or water or help. I am appalled. I walk and walk down the city streets looking for the hospital. Dovre comes with me. I ache and hurt terribly and am driven to get to my girls. I get there and walk down hall after hall until I'd gone full circle and found the admitting office, which is right near the nursery. I look in to see Charla as a tiny baby, maybe two years old, screaming in fear as a nurse tries to work with her. I also see a baby girl with a huge extended vulva and scratch marks on her little thin legs near the pelvic region. I realize she's been sexually abused. I want to rescue Charla but must find out about Paulina first. I ask about her and they tell me the room she is in. They want to know where I've been and why wasn't I around when the girls needed me.
