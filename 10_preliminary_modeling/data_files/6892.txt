I started to wash a white article when a woman came by with a load of laundry and this article and tub was for her. I made a lame apology and went to get my clothes together but the cement floor was dirty with a dog's or cat's feces which I cleaned up. I got my pan but now there were two more with laundry to wash. I wondered if there would be space but I wanted only to wash a few articles. Then I was washing a red figured dress by pouring water about two inches deep on it as it lay spread out on the bed. I told a woman to remove her yellow dress from beside it lest it get wet. She said, "yes, it might discolor your dress." I said, "I was thinking about your dress, not mine."
