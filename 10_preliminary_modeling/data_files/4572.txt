["The walk on the beach."] I am at a beach parking lot. I am in my wheelchair. I see the ocean near by and want to go down to the beach. The people I'm with are busy, so I decide to brave it on my own. I am concerned I will get stuck in the sand. I find a sandy path down to the beach, take a deep breath and try it. I slide down and manage to get on the beach. I am happy. I look around and travel in circles on the beach. I see some other people get stuck in the deep sand and I decide to head back before I get stuck. I find the path which is now a stairway ladder like thing. I now have to step by step go up. I try 3 different times and fall back down. Then I manage, precariously one step at a time. I get to the top, feeling good about making it. I turn and look at the ocean again. It is now swirling up to where it was. I am glad I got out of there in time.
