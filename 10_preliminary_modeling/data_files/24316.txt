Deep sea fishing, getting hooked, being horrified that I was reborn with a defect. I reeled in a giant sea bass. I still wanted to throw it back, even though it was huge. It wasn't a record, and it wasn't a fighting game fish like a marlin. The George Bush critique  play that was supposed to be therapy for my time at war. It's not therapy for me to merely do it. I need to let everyone else know. The problem with the girl dropping stuff all over the racetrack and causing an accident by the car sucking in the ball bearings.
