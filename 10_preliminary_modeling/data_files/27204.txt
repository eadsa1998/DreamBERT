I was in a large modern hamburger stand. I was waiting for a bus. I saw several buses outside that would pull around a circular plot of grass in front of the store. I stood at a tall window looking out of the window. While waiting I ate potatoe sticks and fritos (both of which I do not care for). My arms were full of books and I found it difficult to eat.
