I had to kill these 3 guys because they had a jewel thing which was needed to stop some evil thing. This building had exploded but it looked ok. Upstairs there were evil things, made from a good effects computer game. I killed two of the guys and one was Will Smith. The third guy was in a car with some person and they had locked the doors. I got them to come out and explained to them why I was doing it. The third guy came up to help me. It was all effects up there. It was all made of holograms but I still had to pass it. I was at a 'Timezone' place. It was pretty evil. Mom was there too and you got heaps of points, but it was really hard. There were strange people around.
