I was in a large house with some relatives.  I was trying to find the bathroom, so that I could use it before going across the street to get in a military formation which was already gathering.  When I found a bathroom, it was tiny, like a port-a-john, and while I was in it, one of the relatives, a pre-teen or teenager opened the door.  I was embarrassed and told him to come back later when I was finished.  I felt a lot of pressure about getting to the formation on time; I felt sure I would be late and get in trouble.  When I finished in the bathroom, I rushed across the street, where a large battalion-size gathering was already in place but still spacing themselves out.  I didn't know where I was supposed to go.  I ran in among them, where it looked like there might be a gap, and one guy told me where to stand.  I asked him if he was the platoon leader, and he smiled and said no.  I was relieved to know that I had made it in time and had not been noticed by the commanders.  Before everyone was in place, we were dismissed for the day and told we could pick up coupons for free beer.
