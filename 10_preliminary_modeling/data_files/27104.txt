I was standing with my family (mother &amp; father, ages 45 and sister, age 22) and several other unknown people by the runway of an airfield. We watched a very large airplane take off. The crewmen were sitting on the wings and not until the plane had taken off from the ground did they begin to crawl into the plane in single file. It seemed very dangerous. The plane did many loops and turns in the air and I was afraid it would crash. Then there were many miniatures of this large plane which would dive into the ground and then bounce back up into the air. Next a group of jet planes flew by. One of them crashed by my sister. The plane when it crashed turned into a toy airplane. Nevertheless everybody ran except my sister. The next thing I knew, my sister was blind and I felt that it were my fault. I felt very bad but I do not know why.
