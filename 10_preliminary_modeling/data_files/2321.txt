I am at a big social where crowds of people are milling around getting acquainted. I feel shy and look at all the people as they swirl around me. A man, stocky build like a strong teddy bear, asks me to please be kind and dance with him so he won't have to continue this torture, of being alone and looking. I agree and we dance and dance around and around. He is comfortable, fun and kind. I enjoy his company and vice versa. As we whirl, he says, "Look at the face on that woman," and then turns us so I can enjoy what he saw. We are very much attuned to each other. Finally, I say, "I have to stop. I have arthritis and need to take some aspirin soon or I'll be hurting badly." He is concerned and helpful.
