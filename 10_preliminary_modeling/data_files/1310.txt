I'm moving and I must go to the biology office to get some books so I can know more about the department. I have a cut on my finger. The department head says co-worker Josh told him to watch out for me. He stares at me and we both laugh. We don't know why he said that. A good-looking guy, a teacher, is watching me. The secretary gets me 5 or 6 books and I leave. I get in an elevator that is as large as a room, with furniture in it. I go to the back and then turn around and go to the front, stepping over furniture. I get out and I'm in search of another department office but I can't remember which one I'm looking for. I go down the corridor. I see Co-worker Josh in the cafeteria. I show him my cut finger. He asks me if I'm going into the cafe line. I say, "No, I'm on my way." I continue on. I see a violent man and his woman. They hit and throw things. I try to sneak away from them. I go into an empty office to call security. I try to lock the door but he's pushing on the door. They get in. I'm pretending to talk to some friend but it's really security. I don't fool the guy. He leaves the room, starting a dangerous fire outside the door. I go to a small window to break it so I can escape. It's too small, so I scurry out to the hall and find a bigger window. I escape.
