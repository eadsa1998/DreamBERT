I was at school. Calvin and I were in a group with Seamus and Dmitri. We were sitting outside at a bench. Seamus had this Pokemon book, and we were organizing the pages. I put my pages over there and Dmitri said "When was the last time you were over here?" We were discussing Pokemon from the book. I remember we were talking about Steelix and this other thing that Dmitri said looked like "Aqua girl". I said "I've never heard of it, what's it from?" He started laughing and said that he had made it up and I was like 'What the hell? That's not funny'.
