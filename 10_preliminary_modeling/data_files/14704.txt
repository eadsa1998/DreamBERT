Mom's house was weird. There were lots of different sets of stairs and there were no walls on the rooms. It was only temporary. Ezra's room was near mine and we heard this noise, but it was just a cat. We then ended up in an alternate universe or something. Some stuff came through with us and it had this thin black tape (it was like film from a video tape) hanging off it. This guy helped me to move my bookshelf which had come through but the piece of black film was attached to another shelf thing which had to be carried with it. I thought that if it ripped it would disappear. Some people there got suspicious of us and so I told Ezra to pull the fire alarm. A friend of mine was there and I told him to grab some of my dream books and put them somewhere safe and he did. I hid under a desk and the water started pouring down. Everyone, except a few people, ran out. Ezra and I finished moving the shelf. I mentioned the word 'movie' to someone and they didn't know what a movie was. Later, I was watching a movie that had Michelle Williams in it. At the end she got together with this guy and said "Oh I'm a Virgo aren't I?" and giggled and I said 'I was going to say that' (it was a reference to something that had happened earlier in the movie).
