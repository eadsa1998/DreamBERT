I was trying to make a correction on a document to reflect something that had changed related to the document. I opened the document to make the change and realized that the piece of information that I thought I needed to change was in a pdf, which meant it would already be correct and I wouldn't need to change it. I opened the pdf anyway to make sure and then I got confused. Then another thought occurred to me, making me think I did need to edit it anyway. Then another thought, which made me think it was okay. I went round and round like this for quite some time. I was becoming agitated, mostly because of my uncertainty about the right thing to do.
