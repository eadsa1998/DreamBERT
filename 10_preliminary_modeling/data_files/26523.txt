 I'm eating dinner at a fancy restaurant. I order steak, but am served ground pork with linguini. I ask to see a man's menu to clarify the order. The waiter won't take this item off the bill, even though I didn't order it. I say, "Then I'll eat it!" I get a box to go. I go talk to a manager. The restaurant is expensive.
