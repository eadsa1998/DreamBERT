My husband goes to bed and I am waiting for my old boyfriend. I go to see if the boyfriend is on the couch. He isn't. I go outside and see some kind of weird plane in the sky. It comes down and I see it is my boyfriend and another man. It is some kind of important invention. I am taking pictures of my boyfriend's father and the flash keeps falling off my camera.
