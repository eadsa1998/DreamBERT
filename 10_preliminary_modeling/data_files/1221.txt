Several good dreams about Mitch. In one he hugs me. It was sensual, and felt wonderful. I responded. I put my arms around him. I felt his soft skin. He wasn't wearing a shirt. It felt very good. In another dream, Mitch complained that he was so depressed because there were lots of things he couldn't do because of his disability, and he kept losing more as time went by. I said with gentleness, "Even able-bodied people can't do lots of things." He gave me a weary look like, "Please don't say that. It's so dumb, an able-bodied response." I gestured at him to wait and I said, "I know the able-bodies can maybe do more than you, but please listen to me, somehow it just doesn't matter. Don't get hung up in depression. That's what stops her."
