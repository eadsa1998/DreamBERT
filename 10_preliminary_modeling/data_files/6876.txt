I went into the small classroom and laid down my two small heads, one of which has a hole in the crown, and my handbag to hold a seat and went to the toilet. First stall had no latch so went to one on the left but came back to first to finish. Then I went down to cafeteria and back to classroom to take exam. Bag is missing. I ask permission to leave to hunt for bag. Return to cafeteria to see if bag left there. Receive some large oatmeal cookies in a paper. Ask for bag. They hadn't seen it. Quite worried. But then I know this is a dream. In the big classroom. I tell students about the exam room in Stockholm with desks marked with red, yellow and green rings e.g. 7th grade arith. are told to take red seats, 8th grade English yellow and 9th grade green. Seats so marked so members of same class would be separated thus cheating more difficult. I ask class what they think of the plan.
