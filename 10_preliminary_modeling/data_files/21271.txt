I heard someone say, "Yes, go ahead; why sure," to my answer. I wanted to dream if Approval would win again. I was an usher in church. I passed the basket and Jimmy Clear gave me $21 to donate to the church and he said he wanted a receipt and I told him I would get it for him. A fellow had two bags of money and was going to put into a wall safe. There was some kind of trough and bottle of whiskey in it. I poured some good whiskey into it and told Martin Kmetzs to give me a pint of it when it was aged about 10 years. I was overexposed. I just had an undershirt on and I was in school. I walked by two girls and my penis was exposed and I was conscious of it. One girl stopped to talk to me and I leaned against her leg and tried to hide my penis. It started to get hard and hot. We talked about shoes. I told her how our shoes got dirty working on the coke yard. I heard ran when I awoke, then no, no, no. I was working on the coke yard with Grandpa and we were looking for an extra oven to pull, but it was getting time for me to go home and change to go to school.
