I was walking in a park one day when I realized I was trying to get to a house on the very top of a hill. I remember this walk very distinctly for it was very rugged. I remember where there used to be steps, these were now just a rolling mass of mud with a steel ridge on either side. You could either walk on the ridge or slide up the mud. There were other obstacles, too, such as high walls and waterfalls. It was a very long walk which seemed to take hours, but I at last reached the top. When I got there, I was shoved into a room with many others. There was a man there discussing posture. He looked at me and seemed very happy. He picked on me immediately, saying I was bowlegged. I listened and listened to him. At the end of his long speech, a very fat woman tried to help me by saying, "You must be very still while in bed." Then I said that I knew I was bowlegged and that my mother tried using braces on my legs but nothing helped them. However, I was taking a Body Mechanics course at Reserve and they had promised that that would help me. Everybody looked relieved and I woke up.
