I was walking into a dark place with flashing lights. There was loud music playing. I saw a girl there holding a child's hand. She had brown shorter hair. I did not live in this world. I would go there when I drank a beer with two blue strips of tape on it. One dimension's time zone was slower in time. Back to the girl. Someone, I think the child, was dying. Me and another man were pumping tubes in midair. Then I felt extremely sad all of a sudden. I was then back to the other dimension. I then drank something in a large bottle with the two strips of blue tape on it. I was then in a third dimension. This place was an island where people were like slaves. I was a slave with the girl with the short brown hair. The man who tried to save the child with me was a slave driver along with the boy from "The Wonder Years." The two slave drivers and I were going to leave on a circular raft. I hid the girl and someone else under the edges of the raft. When we left, the boy from "The Wonder Years" asked me to open my mouth to see if I was smuggling any people off the island in my mouth. I unbelieving asked him why. Then he pulled a head out of his mouth. Then it all stopped and I woke up.
