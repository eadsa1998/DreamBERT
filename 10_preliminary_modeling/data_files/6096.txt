In this dream my friends and I were at my work just hanging around having a good time. I had to leave so I jump in my car to go and cash my check. Somehow I ended up on Route 128 on the side of the road in a house. The house was really my hairdresser's. I went there to cash my check. They ended up giving me $20 for my $70 check. But also while I was there my manager was there getting her hair cut and trying to figure out what style would look best on her. She really doesn't like me, so in my dream she just ignored me. Next thing I knew I was leaving but as I left the beat-up house there were no stairs. So I jumped down and started walking to my car. When I realized they didn't give me the right amount of money. But the money I was to receive now was greater because I won it on a scratch ticket. Then my alarm woke me up and all that money I won from the scratch ticket was just a dream -- Bummer.
