I was at home but it was different. Jared Padalecki was my boyfriend. He wanted to move in and I cleared out some stuff and Darren got some boxes made of this cement stuff. Then we were in a train/bus/plane thing. There were beds and we were sharing one. The vehicle was also alive or something. I took it with me when I left. There was also a young boy and some others. It could only go back down if people gave it money. It let us back down.
