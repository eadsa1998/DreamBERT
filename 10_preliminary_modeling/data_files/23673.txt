Early in dream, I was looking for studio rental space for Tom M.  Saw about four places.  Then I was out with friends.  Unclear.  I met a man who I felt like I may have met before.  He was deformed, but not like the Other one, seen in channeling.  This man's eyes were strange.  I think he was bald.  He was a bit pitiful.  The Other one in channeling was confident, strong within himself.  This man was needy.  I invited him over.  We went to my childhood home, to my oldest sister's room (my room during high school).  We talked, but did not have sex.  I think I stopped him from touching me a few times.  I knew he liked me.  Finally I just wanted him to leave.  His eyes would change from one long eye - a slit, to two eyes, to other deformed eyes.  It was very early morning.  I told him he would have to sneak out before my parents saw him.  He almost cried and said no, he wanted to meet my parents!  I was horrified, but managed to tell him that my father was very mean about me with men and he couldn't find out that he was in there.  He was upset.  I went out of the room and discovered Dad awake and ready for work and Mom up too.  I really did not want them to know I had brought someone home, especially someone that pitiful.  I thought of having my middle sister help me get Mom distracted, wait til after Dad left, and slipping the guy out.  His name was Hardy??  Well Mom asked me about the man in my room!  So she knew.  Then Dad was creeping around the bedroom door and I had to tell him I really didn't want him to go in.  So he knew too.  Then I opened the bedroom door.  Hardy was gone, but he had left a note, engraved on three pieces of thick leather, telling me how much he loved me.  My family saw the leather notes, they had pictures and complicated flowers drawn in.  They were beautiful.
