A friend of mine (m, 23) took me into a building in search of something (I don't know what). He opened a door and there was a winding corridor cluttered with dusty antiques. We followed the passageway until we came to an open room. Several men popped up from behind objects with rifles, and we were stopped. Then two girls (probably about 25) came in with the leader (m) of the gang who was fat and about 35-40. My friend was taken away and I was led into a waiting room where I sat with the two girls and a man. Eventually another girl came out of the room adjoining the waiting room and said it was my turn to go into the leader's bedroom. The scene changed to the hallway where we had originally entered. There was my friend and several policemen (I was just an onlooker for this portion) and they were in the process of collecting the gang together.
