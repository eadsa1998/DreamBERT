I was sitting at my desk waiting for class to begin when a girl I had been dating quite frequently entered the room. I was rather surprised to see her for she had been vacationing in Florida the past week. As she passed behind me to get to her seat one of her girlfriends asked her where she got the fraternity pin which was quite prominent on her blouse. She replied that she was pinned to Dinny Bernaway while in Florida. I was quite hurt to hear this for she had turned me down when I had asked her to go steady a few months earlier.
