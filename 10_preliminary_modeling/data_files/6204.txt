My friend (Joel) and I were in a big house. There were four young girls playing somewhere in the house. These girls were approximately ten or eleven years of age. At first Joel and I were just watching the girls socialize in the backyard. They were congregated around the swimming pool with what looked like dolls. Anyway, we went back in the house, where the girls were playing in several rooms while Joel and I were watching TV downstairs. Suddenly, we heard several knocks right above us. We figured out that the father was coming downstairs. As soon as he made his way down the stairs Joel hesitantly took off running. I followed him outside until we were not in clear view: He then (desperately) asked me to call a cab from the payphone in the backyard. He told me of a party that was going on that night. He suddenly flipped me a coin but I didn't react to it quickly enough. He flipped me a second coin as if he were James Dean. I proceeded to call the cab and I woke up as soon as it arrived.
