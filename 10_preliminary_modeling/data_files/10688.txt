I called my ex-boyfriend Sam to get mad at him for breaking a promise I didn't think he was going to keep in the first place. I am downtown and some girl asks me who the guy is with my brother. I tell her that the one wearing the mechanic shirt is my ex. I say, "He's not a mechanic," and walk away. I am roaming down the street. I go by a sushi restaurant where an old fling works. There is a circusy feel to the area. A lady asks me if I'd like to pet her pink elephant.
