I don't remember my dream too clearly, but I was at a party. It was my graduation party, but it wasn't the party I had gone to where everybody was dressed formally and everybody was very elegant. It was another party in which everybody was dressed as a hippie and there were very few classmates. The house was country style and in my dream I didn't see or hear an orchestra, but we danced and had lots of fun.
