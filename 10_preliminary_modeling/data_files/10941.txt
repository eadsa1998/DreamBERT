I was waiting in a theater for a friend. I saw a girl dancing on the stage. She was dressed in a lovely pink ballerina gown. When the show was over, the man I was waiting for came over to the last aisle in the back where I was sitting, and we started out. Then the girl came out too and I congratulated her on her exquisite performance. She looked less happy than she had on the stage, and I felt guilty about that because I was going out with my friend and she was not. There was a bench in back of us and on it was a cake that had been made for her. I think I made it, but I'm not certain.
