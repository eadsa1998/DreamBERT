I was in my house. On top of the bookcase in the sunroom were piled books and record albums (the bookcase is about seven feet high and there are not generally books on top of it). I was searching for some playing cards which were mixed up with the books and albums. As I was doing this, my Sunday school pupils were coming in the door. They stopped to say hello to me and then went on into the kitchen where the class was supposed to be held. My pupils are 4th graders. Only one little girl stands out in my dream. She said something to me, but I can't remember what it was. The cards that I was searching for had a blue bicycle design.
