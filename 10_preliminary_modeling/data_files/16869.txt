I was in a flat - my home supposedly - which was like a bungalow - ground floor flat, a bit boxy, by spacious and modern with a large central hall space with a split level down to a living room. My partner and her sister Cat were in the living room. It must have been early in the morning because I hadn't got up yet. I slipped past the open living room door to the bathroom to have a shower. For some reason, the whole end wall of the bathroom was a floor to ceiling plate glass window. At first I got a shock because I was half undressed, as there was a football stadium right on the other side of the window, so that the players and half the crowd could see right into the bathroom. Then, an equally bizarre realisation was that there wasn't a real stadium outside - rather, the window was in fact a floor to ceiling plasma tv screen, which was showing a football match.
