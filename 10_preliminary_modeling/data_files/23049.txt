My wife Bonita and I were traveling in Russia, by train.  We were at the train station, which was much like a subway station, fiddling with a Falk-type map to see where we wanted to go (a bridge across some river to some island in the river -- I couldn't find it on the map), and another Falk map to figure out which train to take to get there.  It was really a mess.  I thought I had time to study it a while, but while I was looking at it, a train pulled in.  In the meantime, I had to exchange some money.  I had American coins in my left pocket, Russian in my right, and I was afraid of mixing them together.  I was standing at the exchange window while I was studying the maps, so I frantically began to try to figure out the exchange system, thinking it would be better, if possible, to exchange on a coin-for-coin basis.  There were several types of Russian coins on display there, but some were in kopecks and some were something else, besides being in different amounts.  There were also a lot of coins, including American ones, lying on the floor in front of the counter where people had evidently dropped them, and I couldn't resist wasting my precious time by picking some up.  We finally decided we had better get on the train before it left, even if we weren't sure it was the right one.  After we got on, I began trying to think of how to ask someone how to get where we wanted to go.  But I couldn't think of the word for "station," nor the word and correct aspect for "go" in this case.  Norman was suddenly there, and he said "station" was "some Russian word."  I knew that meant "man," but thought it might also mean "station."  I asked him whether it took the preposition and what  he said didn't sound right to me.
