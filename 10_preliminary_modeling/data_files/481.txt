I am in a museum where I have a room. I want to put up new doors. I need to use the phone but a rude woman is on the phone and says something. A woman operating the museum remarks how rude that is and so do I. Then I accidentally drop a door on the rude woman and say, "I'm getting out of here. This is someplace I don't want to be."
