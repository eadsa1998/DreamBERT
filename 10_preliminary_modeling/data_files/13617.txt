I was at a shop. Mom and Ezra went off and I found this Entourage shop. I was thinking of getting an Ari thing. I went back to Mom and told her. Ezra went to get food. He found this place and the guy gave him a free sample and gave me some too. It was really nice, but it was fattening. We got food from somewhere else and I tasted Ezra's chips and they were really nice. There was something about a Top 100 guys list. George Clooney had won from 1986-1996 or something. There was a car with Colin Farrell and some other guy in it. A friend of Mom's said "thought you weren't eating, that you were on a diet" and I said "I am, but these chips are so nice".
