I am preparing to do a performance at a meeting. The woman boss is talking and I realize I don't have my scripts with me for the play. I start looking around the office. I make a mess with all the papers I look through. As I am frantically searching, I also notice that the audience is off in another part of the room, partitioned off. If we moved ourselves into their room, we would be seen better. I check and see that there is plenty of room beyond the office partition. I wonder why we were told to do it in the office in the first place. I am worried that I can't remember the words or the sequence of things we are supposed to do. I am unhappy, and frantic. [BL]
