After coming into work at Basch Jewelers, I went downstairs to leave my coat and books. On the way up the steps to the office I passed a girl who was going down. Just after the girl passed, I realized it was Millie, a high school girl who worked part time. I was quite surprised because she had been out sick for the past two weeks. After greeting her, surprisedly I noticed she looked rather pale from her illness.
