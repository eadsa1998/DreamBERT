My chest was hurting real, real bad in school so Mrs. Smith [ her teacher] just said " I have something for your chest" I said "what is it, what is it, what is it?". "It's a needle and a safety pin" she said "Needles for sticking the needle where it hurts in your chest. Then putting the safety on the needle".
