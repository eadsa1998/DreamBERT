I was to leave for California the next afternoon early. School was still in session and I planned to attend the classes all day, but soon realized that it would be impossible. I found it hard to convince myself that it wouldn't make any difference. I was not packed, and mother was to help by getting breakfast for me, but she didn't, and I couldn't find any clothes to take. Finally I packed my winter bathrobe and that's about all. I was to fly, a fact which has been a source of fear in other dreams, but was not too important except that I remember saying, "Everything here is finished anyway. I've started nothing new." My sister and a girlfriend were going too, but the arrangements were vague. I was to fly alone.
