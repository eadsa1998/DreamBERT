That my roommate confided in me that during the summer she met A. - he was searching for me and seeing her instead, he captured her. (Wearing a long black cape, he choked her and carried her away.) He confined her for the summer in his harem (He is a Moslem) where she was cruelly treated and given only ice cream to eat. He had many women &amp; their boy children in this low ceilinged structure (the harem) and periodically went on forays for more captives. My roommate learned to love A. and since she was jealous of his love for me - she told me of the summer to arouse my jealousy. I accepted the recital, quite calmly.
