 I'm in line by myself to get tickets to an alpine slide. There are two lines. I see my grade school friend Patrick Bergman and his sister Heather there. My grade school classmate Misty Ryan is in front of me in line. I feel socially inept for being alone. A person from my high school named Shawn is there. I catch him trying to budge in front of me in line. I verbally reprimand him, but then joke around because he intimidates me and I don't want to upset him. A ticket costs $1.50. I give the woman a dollar and try to slide two quarters off her work desk without her noticing while she is helping the person in front of me. The woman selling the tickets is the short, big gray-haired woman at Mason Cafeteria. She catches me sliding the two quarters and verbally reprimands me. I give her a $5 bill to go along with my dollar to pay for the ticket. She gives me back a bunch of one-dollar bills with a $5 bill on top, some coins, and my ticket! She obviously made a mistake, but I don't say anything and quickly move out of the line. The woman behind me sees the error and says something about it. I try to get away with the money and ticket.
