I am in a closet when I hear that my Father is coming to town; I drive a limousine, with Dad in the backseat. I take over and drive the car very carefully and with difficulty through traffic; I take all the people home till I get to Father Andrew's where Wendy is staying. I will help celebrate Nevena's birthday party. And Dad is left behind. -- Dee Palmer (from Church--but Nevena's grandmother's name = Palmer) I see her trying to get up a steep hill, see her struggling to get a foothold; but can't see if she makes it. At Father Andrew's house: I arrive first, then hear Father arrive through garage downstairs. Hear him say to Nevena: "Your shoes are in the closet." Wendy is dressing up in Nevena's clothes: uncertain how to play part.
