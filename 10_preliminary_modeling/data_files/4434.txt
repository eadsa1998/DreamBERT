["Spies everywhere."] I ask a man to help me carry my things up a flight of stairs. I have a wooden tea tray, with papers on it. I also have a bunch of snow I am going to analyze. I want the man to carry the snow. It's heavy. I put it on his little red wagon. Then we walk up the stairs. I see he left the red wagon and I am upset. I need the snow to do my analysis. I see a toy on the stairs. I wonder how it got there, because I thought I was carrying it with me, but here it was, ahead of me. Now we are in a room. I look out the window. I see flying machines that are like erector set helicopters. I realize the spies are in there. I tell the man we need to go into the room because they can't see us there. We go in. I look out the window again and I see water with toy boats and erector set devices traveling by the window. I realize these have microphones in them and if we talk, then the spies will hear what we say. We are surrounded.
