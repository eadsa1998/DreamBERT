I was at the university when they called my name over the loud speaker and said that they had to see me at the administration office. When I was going there, Lester, the concierge, was looking for me. When he found me, he told me that I had been named president of the committee to help the victims of the May 31st earthquake in the zone of Barranco (that is, to collect the donations in Barranco). In the office there was a sign that said I was the president of the committee and they should give the donations to me. They told me to put it on a wall with tacks. I climbed a ladder, but it was shaking, or perhaps it was me. I didn't like the idea very much because it would take time away from my studies and besides, I had to work in the afternoons.
