I am in a huge Victorian house with other people. There are lots of kids. I am going down the halls and seeing groups of kids spilling out of the rooms and into the hallways. Now water is rushing in and I must run as fast as I can upstairs to the roof. I make it to the small windowed room at the very top. Now that room is like a space craft, NASA to be exact, hexagonal in shape, or the cone tip on the rocket. We must escape. I and some others are put into a suspended state, sort of like the beam-up thing in Star Trek. It disengages all our molecules, stores them and when we arrive at the new planet, which will support human life, we are reassembled. We travel hundreds of years and then I am reactivated. I guess earth was being destroyed and the smartest and best leaders, especially with good facilitating skills, were chosen to start the new home.
