I dreamed I was at home (Trujillo) talkig to all my family when I suddenly found out that my mother was taking a trip and I felt very sad. When I came out to say goodbye, I saw a boy who lives in front of my house (and whom I always liked) getting out of a station wagon. He looked at me in a strange way, like a combination of sadness because I was sad, and happiness at seeing me again, and he stood next to me. I don't remember any more.
