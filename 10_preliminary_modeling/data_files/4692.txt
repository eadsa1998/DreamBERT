["Moving to Alaska."] I moved to Alaska where I am staying with a woman and her husband. She works as a teacher in an elementary school. I go with her to try for a job there myself. We drive through the snow and mud for 10 miles. I am driving a van. A white one. It sure looks like we could get stuck. I'm nervous and careful. We slide through. I remember to keep the gas going fast so we don't bog down and get stuck. It's a curvy road. Then we stop and the woman takes off her high heels (She's wearing a light grey business suit). She walks barefoot in the snow. I wonder how she can stand it. We get into the school through a series of back porch doors. A male teacher is behind me and trying to help open the doors for me, but I hurry ahead and get them myself. I see the woman teacher who will interview me and I shake her hand, being friendly. Trying to impress her. I'll know I'll get the job. She asks which grades I'd prefer to teach. I answer 3rd or 5th. I like the older grades. She complains the big office won't really pay attention to her. I sympathize with her.
