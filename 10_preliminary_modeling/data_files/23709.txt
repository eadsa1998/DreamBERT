We're in the Soviet Union.  Touring the 'new' effect of politics on buildings.  I separate from my family / tour group.  I go in a theater.  Natasha Richardson is on screen.  Very sensual, moving her torso, breasts in a tight tank.  Several scenes of this and audience reacting.  Then Natasha comes off screen and floats or slides up the aisle to me.  Rest of audience 'goes' away.  Just me and her.  I know who she is.  Very sensual and close.  I want to be close to her sensuality.
