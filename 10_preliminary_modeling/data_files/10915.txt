The early part of the dream I can hardly remember. I only know that I knew a poetic, artistic young man, and he died on the corner of Euclid and Adelbert Roads. There was no accident or anything unusual. He just lay down on the sidewalk and expired. The second part is not much clearer. I was in a sort of drawing class. We had to copy a make variations on a girl's figure. She had a very full skirt and very padded, broad shoulders. We drew her outline on the paper by drawing around a figure of her made in chocolate. Somehow, I couldn't find my chocolate figure and had to borrow someone else's. That figure was getting melted and soft, so that as I traced around it, I got chocolate all over my finger. I thought I was copying the girl's figure front view. Suddenly I looked up and it had changed to back view. I had to erase a great deal.
