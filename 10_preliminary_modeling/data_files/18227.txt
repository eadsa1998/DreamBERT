I and several other people -- I don't believe I knew any of these people in particular, but they were all about my age ---were being chased by this group of other people, some of them older people, some of them around my age. One of them that I knew, this boy named Scott in my French class. Why we were being chased I'm not exactly certain. We were being chased thru this huge classroom, class building on campus, not an actual one, but just one in my dreams. It involved this running thru classrooms and in and out of classrooms and up and down these stairs, being pursued and not knowing when you saw someone coming toward you if this was one of your pursuers or one of your friends. But finally I got caught by some of the people. I guess some of the other people who were with me got caught too. We were all real exhausted from this big chase and so we were sort of lounging around trying to catch our breath and everything.
