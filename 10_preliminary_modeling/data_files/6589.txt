Riding on a river steamer. Great crowd at stern. One man takes a baby, small but acting as if older and happy. He ties it up under his arms where all can see. Baby laughs. Baby belongs to some woman. (Associated woman with self.) Steamer goes on stopping frequently at crowded towns. Passes one almost black boat with no windows but through open front see a woman passenger. The boat is like a Chinese one. I talk to passengers about boat and decide it's a freight boat. Our steamer has sides that open up. I see a two year old baby standing by open side looking over and rush to seize it and carry it over to other side and ask it to sit with me. A door is swinging in the way of our seats. We go to kitchen. Cook explains some article cooked. See a large oblong tank filled with hot water. Cook hands us things to eat. Nearing destination. Scramble to dress to get off. Must change my white shoes and stockings to darker ones. Change lying face down. See wharf where we are to disembark. It appears crowded. No place for boat to dock. Previously one man left behind and one nearly so jumps on after boat is leaving. R. tells me she has had invitations to walk on shore from every male passenger. She shows me letters to herself and J. which advise her marrying a man even if he is foreign. I see three bridges for an instant. On one is my name in full. My name appears to be drawn on a letter and over river at the same time.
