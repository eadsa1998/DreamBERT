I was in a bedroom and was awakened and saw M. and two others in a narrow bed. They had been away. I said, "They don't notice us. I'll wait to welcome them later and will sleep longer." I put on my old pink dress. R. asked what length I wore my dress. I said this one was shorter than most. I shortened it when skirts were shorter. Someone admired the dress. Then the doctor was to examine me. I took off all my clothes except bra and old fashioned open drawers. He said he wanted a sheet. R. had the sheet and cutting folds apart partly slit the sheet. It will have to be mended.
