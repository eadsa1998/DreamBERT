I am traveling with Pedro and we stop at a hotel for lunch. I have lost my purse and wonder if it is still in the van we came in, believing I placed it on the floor of the van. I run out of the hotel along a winding path that leads downhill to a brook and in my hurry I fall into the creek which is quite muddy and I get my left foot wet, full of mud. I hobble back to the van and believe that I find my purse.
