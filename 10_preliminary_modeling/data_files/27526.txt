I was walking past John Hay High School when a teacher, about 60, whose class I had observed the day before, walked out of the building. She carried a pair of scissors and started to cut a bouquet of lovely autumn flowers. I remember orange marigolds, yellow chrysanthemums, and red flowers of one type. She held up the bouquet and I admired it. Strangely enough there were carrots included in the assortment of flowers. She offered me a carrot and I ate it. When I returned home I found that someone had sent a bouquet of flowers and this surprised me.
