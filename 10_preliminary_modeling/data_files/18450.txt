I and some friends were in an old deserted church. It had been opened recently by some college girl and a friend of hers, ostensibly to pray in, but actually so they would have a place to have intercourse. I and assorted friends were investigating the place, however, because we suspected a vampire was living in it. We were searching through the church, looking behind doors. I saw some feet under a curtain, so I tackled the figure, but it turned out to be someone either neutral or on our side - I forget who. Then, while investigating the pulpit, I noticed a small hole in the wall, and decided that the vampire must live in that. We settled down to wait for night, in order to capture and kill the vampire so we could use the church. Meanwhile, we sang some hymns and occasionally I threw things at the hole up on the wall, trying to throw things inside it to disturb the vampire, but without success. Finally it was night, the sun down, and the vampire flew out of the hole. He was in the form of a little brown bat. He flew around and at us, and I was slashing at him with a sword. Finally my friend and I caught him, held him by his wingtips, and stabbed him frequently with our knives. The vampire said that we couldn't kill him that way, but we replied that we could mutilate and weaken him. We wanted to get him to change back into human form so we could keep better control over him, but he wouldn't. Finally we forced him into a small cardboard box and pinned him down in it. As the dream ended, it was near morning and we were discussing whether to just expose him to the sun in the morning and thus finish him off. I think that's what we decided to do.
