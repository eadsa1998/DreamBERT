School is just about officially out for the year, and the last report card I get is algebra, where an 86 has been written over a space where "I'll tell you why" has been erased.  I am determined to find out the reason for the low grade.  We have a big assembly at school that night, and I am supposed to give the Lord's Prayer, but a teacher says I can leave if I want to.  I am glad, because I have to go to a conference the next day, but I feel guilty about leaving in front of all those people.
