I was watching my brother Steve and Mary taking care of Judy. They were on the front porch in Rivertown. I was standing on the street. Mary came by with a lady friend and they were passing me without recognizing me. I spoke up and Mary then stopped and we talked. Andy P. came by in a boat which ran on the street. He was piloting it along. I was in Rivertown walking down the street and there were a lot of dogs. Then I came to a field and there were bulls. One was very big. I flew by him. Then I came by Walter Luzina. He got kind of tough with me. He was a leader of a gang. He roughed me up a little and then said, "Now punch me. He held still and I was punching him on the chin. He would get a little dazed, but didn't drop. I must have punched him about ten times. Then something else happened. I had a knife and I'm not sure what happened, whether he tried to stab me and I took the knife from him. I think I killed him, then I broke the knife blade and I took off in flight so I wouldn't get charged for murder.
