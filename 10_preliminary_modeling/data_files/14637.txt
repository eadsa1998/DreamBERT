I was playing World of Warcraft, but it was real. I can't remember properly, but I was in village, hiding behind walls and trying to find a way past (I had to run in between buildings to leave). I realized that I was friendly with them and neutral with some others, so I just walked in. I went into a house and a dog started to growl, so I got a broom, which had a long, yellow feathered end and a short pole. I don't know what happened, but I was then in a forest running.
