I was in my classroom at the university talking with some friends, when the professor came in with some exams we had taken. He started to give out the exams. I didn't want him to give me mine, because I thought I had flunked. But I went to the table where he was and I saw that I had 100 on my test, but then I saw that the grade was 50 instead of 100, but it really wasn't 50, but 95. and then it was transformed into 93, and that was my grade on the exam. He gave me the test and I felt a great relief.
