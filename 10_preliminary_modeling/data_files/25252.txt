 I'm in a Food-n-Fuel gas station. I get $12 in gas and buy a bag of cheddar cheese chips. The bag is small and flat, and costs 99 cents. At the counter the cashier rings up my total of $29! I am furious! All I got was gas, chips, and a bottle of water. It should be no more than $15. The cashier says that someone has to pay for it. Reluctantly, I pay for it, and I tell the cashier that I want to see the manager. This person says that the manager won't be in until tomorrow at 11:30 am. I am thoroughly disgusted. I go outside. There are two or three of my friends with me. We sit. A black police officer comes and talks to us. He empathizes with us. [Note: I needed to get gas today. Today is the 29th of July].
