Dee or Gaye Dilson is driving me from my house out to Crescent City for some kind of affair there--a barbecue, I think.  At the end of Longhorse Blvd., I discover that I have no shoes and ask the driver if she will stop and let me run back to get them.  But it is 6:15, and we are supposed to be there at 6:30, so, since my sandals are in the car, I put them on and wear them.
