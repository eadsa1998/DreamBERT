I am in a big house with lots of rooms, and there are a number of friends and relatives there.  We are anticipating a terrorist attack, and have turned out all the lights and are avoiding the windows.  I don't know how long it has been going on, but I am very tense and worried.  Eventually, though, I look out the window and see that the streets are normal-cars, pedestrians going about their normal business.  I feel a little foolish, and tell everyone that our worries were for nothing.
