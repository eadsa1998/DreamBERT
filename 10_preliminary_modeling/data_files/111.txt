I'm at a restaurant with Bill Wold and another male - (I'm? we're? they're?) harassed by the waiters about another girl. We all leave; Bill and I are going back to the Center. I'm going on the bus; Bill calls a friend to come pick him up. [We'd been sitting outside at an umbrella table.] The bus is slow and it's cumbersome getting off. Bill isn't here yet. I go to a room at the Center, where there's something that wants protecting. I've gotta wait for Bill and this door won't latch properly. The hook's too high for the loop. I try to keep the door pushed to, but it's too much effort. Bill and his friend nearly bust the latch off getting the door open. Then I'm being chased by a man in a mask, on a residential street. I run, yelling for help - a woman looks out of her door, then steps out, then others do the same. The man turns and leaves. Then I'm in a very strange public restroom with a central/circular configuration of toilet stalls with high- and low-separated partitions - you can see other women's upper bodies. I look at a couple of pairs of very pointy tits, extremely curious.
