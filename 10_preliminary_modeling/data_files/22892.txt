Somehow I had managed to get into the agency without a badge.  I have dreamed this dream several times now, ever with any explanation of how I get in the building.  I was able to escape notice by floating over the heads of people.  Also by going up to the second floor, where apparently there weren't so many guards.  The longer I remained inside, though, the more anxious I became about getting caught and figuring how to get out, because they check badges on the way out too.  There were a number of short stairways on the second floor, and small rooms with glass windows in the doors.  There was also a very low passage that I tried to crawl through until it became too narrow.  I thought I was done for at 11:00, when the corridors began to fill with people getting off for lunch.  The only person I saw, though, was Norma Grimson, who, to my surprise, didn't seem to be surprised at seeing me or to wonder about my lack of a badge.  Apparently she and some others were going to a luncheon, and she asked me if Bonita hadn't given me the message about it.  I asked, "Connie Hutchinson or my wife?"  She raised an eyebrow at that, and replied (I believe), "Connie Hutchinson."  I would have liked to go with them, but I couldn't get out without a badge.  Later, after numerous close calls, I somehow came by the badge of a Navy officer.  His eyes and hair looked enough like mine, but he had a rather smashed-in mouth, with missing teeth.  I left in a crowd at 5:00 and rushed through the gatehouse, holding my thumb over the lower part of the picture.  I held it up for the guard to see, and he let me through.
