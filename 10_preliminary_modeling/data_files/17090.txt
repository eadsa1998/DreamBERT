My mother and I were driving home.  Over the park we saw a moving star of light.  We pulled over and slowly the star worked its way toward the car.  We let it come in through the driver's side window.  It hovered and took shape as a hummingbird, as if communicating with our subconscious.  For a moment it had fuzz like a baby chick; it looked like the fuzzy inside of an artichoke.
