I was in a mini mart store robbing the clerk, and he held up a picture of me and my husband, and said, "You've robbed me before," but he was very nice. I ran out to a car and my husband was driving and there was someone else (never really saw him/her). I said, "Let's get out of here, the guy knows us." My husband had a gun and (this part is not clear), we were arguing about something and I grabbed a gun from the glove box and it fired and there was a hole in the dash. I noticed then we were in a big car like a Cadillac and then I noticed my window was cracked -- I guess from the gunfire. We looked for a place to hide out and we stopped by a farm. The guy said we could stay in the horse pasture or the sheep pasture.
