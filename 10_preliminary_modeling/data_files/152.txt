I've just come back from somewhere and found that "we" have been taken over. ("We", I guess, means the whole country, and by Russia, looks like.) There's not many people around and some of them are in groups in houses packing up to leave. There are some poor people at my house with my parents [not my real ones], they've taken them in and we're going off together. (Don't know where to.) This poor woman is sitting like a statue while my mother is folding blankets. She has a ragged white one herself and mother takes it last, folds it, adds it to the bundle. I understand what's happened but I'm not taking much of a hand myself. Finally I ask my mother, by the way, I haven't heard yet, are we taking any of our own things? Like clothes, you know - are we just going with what we've got on or are we packing a suitcase or something? You know all my Units pack flat, though I'd hate to have to leave some of the other stuff, I'd be well enough off with those.
