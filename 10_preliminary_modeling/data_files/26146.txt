 I'm in College Liquor. My professor Marianne Stash is there. I see a group of four or five women, about 25 years old, who aren't particularly attractive. I go up to one in particular who has blond hair, and invite them over to a barbecue that I say we're having. There isn't going to be many people there, I know, and don't say anything. I walk over, they are going down a staircase to a lower level of the store. I write down the address of our house and give it to them. I feel like I may be showing off to Marianne: I'm inviting them over to show her what a "cool" guy I am. <br/
