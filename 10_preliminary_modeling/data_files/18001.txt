I was in a class for...'social modeling' I think.  I was sitting to the left a girl named "Amartya Sen".  She had tan skin, was kind of tall and lanky, and wore big glasses.  I had supposedly met her as a freshman, and I asked how she was doing.  I uncharacteristically asked if she'd like to meet up after class and catch up a little, and we'd made plans to do so.  I looked to the left for some reason, and I noticed then that I was topless.  I was going to try to cover up, but I decided I had already talked to Amartya topless so there was no reason to start caring now.  Class was ending and I looked at my watch.  It was after 5 already.  We went to my longtime classmate Brett's house.  I went to audition with a man (his father?) and my friend/coworker Jason was there.  There was only one line we had to audition with, I don't think the script had been fully completed.  I think I was reading the line off a flower message card.  I wanted to play the role sort of exasperated, adding a sigh.  I was very excited to try out, the prospects of doing something new.  I went to read and just couldn't seem to, with Jason in the room.  I didn't feel embarrassed or overly self-conscious, yet I remained silent.  I went back to the living room.  There was a dog.  Brett's mother offered me Newton-like cookies with a white cream/strawberry filling, and they were very good.  Asked her where she got them without gelatin.  I talked to her like a friend.  Then I climbed around on the roof trying to escape.
