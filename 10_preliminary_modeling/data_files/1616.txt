Merle comes by to visit. His wheelchair is a miniature clown car. I come into the living room to see it and I laugh. Two people are with him. I ask myself how I will be health-wise in 5 years. I look up on the ceiling and I see myself floating back down in some bubbly water. My eyes and my mouth are wide open and I'm staring. I feel queasy and think maybe I'm swimming and I try to make the image look a little less frightening and "dead." I then ask if I'm going to be in a relationship. I look around the living room and don't see anyone. Later, I go upstairs to talk to Jerome. Dickie is in his office and I sit next to him and tell him off. I wait for W so I can tell him off too. I see a window and notice I am now where the "health" image had been floating and I try to see it from another perspective. All I see is the living room from a ceiling view.
