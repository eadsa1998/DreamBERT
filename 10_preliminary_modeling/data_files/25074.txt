 I go into a classroom. It reminds me of my 5th grade classroom at Carter School. My desk is in the front left corner of the room. There is an old turkey sandwich wrapped in napkins in it. It is like homeroom in high school, but it is college. My friend from college Yvette Ullman is there sitting next to me, and we talk.
