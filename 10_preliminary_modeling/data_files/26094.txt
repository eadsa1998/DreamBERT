 I'm wearing a pair of overalls that are size 40x32. They are huge! I'm in a store. I'd like a pair of 34x34 overalls. I see a pair of red overalls. They are long, but I'm not sure the arms will be long enough. With me in the store is a woman who may be Stephanie Peterson, a woman I'd like to date at Brimson.
