As a car that is like a bus starts off, she runs after it and I follow saying he'll wait for two. He does take us on. When we reach city and ask about return, he shows us on a paper there's none till next day. I say, "my brother lives here and I'll borrow money from him." for I had left with no money or baggage. The driver, we seem to be in his house now, has changed to a blue and white shirt. He asks what brother does. I tell him he's a Federal Income Tax Reviewer, checks big corporation returns, etc. He says he must look up his address, asks for telephone directory and pencil and picks up a round case from the table and a pencil falls out. He tells how his sons fail to return pencils. I tell her I think my brother will let us both sleep there.
