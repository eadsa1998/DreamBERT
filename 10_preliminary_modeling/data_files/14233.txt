I was at school, which was at North Midvale, in the classroom. The kids in the class were mucking around and nothing was happening so I put my head down to rest and teacher gave me a warning. I asked why and she gave me two more. I said that people were mucking around and I decided to rest and I get in trouble? She gave me a note to see the principal and I threw it on the ground and she said that I'd be better off walking home and I said that I was. She followed me until I got past the gate and gave up. I was then walking on the path and I was like 6 or so. There were other kids around that age watching Bob the Builder on the path. I was thinking it was lame. Eugene was there and said it was lame too. He was young as well. Some time later, we were at his house and I was going through some photos. His brother Rodney and father Abraham were there. I was hoping to befriend him now so I could go out with him in the future. There were photos of me too. I kept going to ask questions about computers, but remembered they weren't up to the same standard yet.
