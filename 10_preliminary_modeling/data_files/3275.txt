I am swimming in a pool. Dovre's swim coach, an older plump athletic woman, watches me. I am a very good swimmer. She is impressed, but stoically watches, not encouraging me. I swim fast and do laps. Now she wants to train me for the team. Now I'm on an airplane, with a small girl with me. The coach is the pilot of this small craft. The little girl doesn't want to sit on the seat I chose for her right next to me because it's a "holding" seat. I assure her it is not a holding seat. The pilot coach also assures her. He sits reluctantly. Now in the back of the plane is a famous male movie star and the other women of the swim team are all agog around him. I watch him and he watches me. We are interested. Now we are at a party, perhaps at my mansion, and I change into a lovely evening gown. I am now drunk on bubbly champagne and fall, and stagger and giggle.
