At home my mother was talking to great Aunt Mimi.  I went to the bathroom, but it didn't look clean, so I went to the one in the back.  I found I was on my period.  I came out and interrupted.  I had 40 minutes to get back to school for class.  It was a test day.  I went in and there were only a few people in the room.  They explained the test was sort of a group thing, so without understanding I copied answers, although the two papers I could see differed completely.
