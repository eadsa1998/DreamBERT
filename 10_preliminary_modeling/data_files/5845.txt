[1997-07-24] I remember dreaming of some of the stuff that happened to me while I was in the hospital recently. I dreamed of the tubes that were down my throat for breathing. I remember the tubes vividly, I believe they were made out of plastic and I remember it being taped to the side of my face. I couldn't yell and I couldn't talk I couldn't really do anything. My left arm had a restraint strap on so I wouldn't pull the tube out. I also dreamed that they took the strap off and they left it off for about 2 days I guess and finally I did pull the tube out myself and the funny part was that they did leave the restraint off and as I awoke, I did pull the tube out. The dreams that I've had lately are mostly about my time in the hospital.
