["Going to Russia."] I am with a group of people. We are traveling together like a group from MIUSA. A man like Drew Carey who is like Arthur is there. I like him. His wife was killed or died and he had her stuffed and placed on the bulletin board of the classroom so we would remember her. I move her aside when putting up another poster. Someone takes her to put away so she won't be injured. A Warren Beatty type man is there and there is some friendly competition between Drew and Warren about the group. I side with Drew. We are outside now, walking down a sidewalk. Apparently we are headed for Russia. It's an exchange learning group. We arrive and are speaking with a Russian woman. She is trying to better her English. She speaks in Russian and the interpreter tells me what she says. Then I explain to her that her syntax or pattern is wrong. I then tell her how to say it right. Drew and I are friends.
