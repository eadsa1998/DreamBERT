I am in the military.  Unlike in other dreams, I seem to be in the proper uniform-desert fatigues, yet I still feel like an outsider.  I keep worrying that my socks are going to get wet, but I see that I am wearing boots.  My unit is preparing to go to battle.  We are going in jeeps.  Everyone seems to be in pairs.  I ask one of the pairs if the jeeps can take three people, and I was told that they could, with one person in the "rumble seat."  As I was coming up the stairs of a building, I met Dahlia Walters coming down.  I told her I was "about to make war, not love, for a change."  She smiled and responded something which I did not understand-I interpreted it to be a book recommendation of some kind.
