There was some species/game thing called Protpets. There was this thing called Zanuzez, and it liked me and I liked it. This lady had come to school with lots of these pet things. The Zanuzez thing kept growing and it ended up turning into this ferret thing. Anyway, we were all supposed to get one to catch more. There was some sport thing going on. Jake was there and something 'bad' happened. I think Jake and this other little noob got bashed. There was also this little sports cabin.
