["Buying real estate on the bad side."] I walk down 40th street, on my block. I see Lucy who has bought lots of property on this side of the block, which is the bad or lower priced part of the neighborhood. The places she bought are run down and dilapidated. I realize it is a good business move. I say to Lucy, Maybe I should buy some too. She agrees.
