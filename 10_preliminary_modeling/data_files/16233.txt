I was at Melinda's house and we were having a big party, and we were trying to cram all these people into this small little house. And there was like this carport thing in the front, and there was this blonde lady that was about 25 who was trying to tell me how to set up the sound system and what to do. And I don't remember if I set it up or not, and I don't even remember what she was telling me, but I do remember going in the bathroom and seeing this huge like garbage disposal like type thing. And people would throw their garbage in it, they would throw their dirty laundry in it, and there was a little toilet on top. People would even go to the bathroom in it. And they would like flush this _____ handle that would be like flushing a toilet. And for some reason I had the notion that it was getting plugged up and stuff and we were going to have to take some of the dirty laundry out of there. That was cuckoo, man! [laugh]
