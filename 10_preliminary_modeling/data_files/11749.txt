I was at school. I went to the toilet and there were two creepy guys. I flew over a whole house with a bike.  Me and some others dressed in costumes and broke this guy's neck. This group stole something and then we got it back. I was then with Terrence and some others and Mom picked me up from school and it was about 10.00. Then I was on a boat. Julius was friendly with me. I saw Victor Garber and he was really old, but looked just like Dad. He talked to me.
