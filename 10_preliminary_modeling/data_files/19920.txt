I was riding through the country in a bus. I came to New York City. I could feel the difference in the ground when we came to the city. The vibration of the wheels seemed to penetrate to the rocks that New York is said to be built upon. Later I met my sister at a shopping center. The streets were flooded. We came to an area where the ground was gray. We went through the mud to where my mother was waiting in a car.
