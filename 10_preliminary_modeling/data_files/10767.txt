I dreamed that a man continually would come to my dormitory, ring the doorbell and while he waited at the door, I would hide in the living room behind a chair until I would see him leave. I seemed to be aware of the fact that I was terribly afraid of him, although I had never seen him before and he didn't look like anyone I had ever seen or known. I believe that a story had been going around the dorm (in the dream) that man would come around to all the dorms and attack the girls. I woke up after the dream (6:30) and was very much afraid. My heart was beating very quickly.
