I was down by the jail. Al. V. was sitting with the prisoners. He had about six months of a year served. The police were getting oranges to eat. The oranges were like grapefruits. Some had a reddish color and the passer said they were a cherry orange. I sat with a girl. I leaned on something and picked it up unintentional and it was the girl's wallet. She had two ten dollar bills wrapped around. The whistle blew and I looked at the clock and it was 11:15 a.m. and there was another clock with 11:25 a.m. I told the girls that the clocks were different. I looked at the 11:15 one and the large handle moved fast to 11:25 a.m. I watched as it moved. It was the time. I was getting my gun ready to go fox hunting by Joe Lucas. He had a farm way out in the wilds and the game was to be good. I looked at my shells and they seemed to be soggy and half full.
