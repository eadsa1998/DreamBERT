I was seated in front of a group of elderly bearded men who sat solemnly like a tribunal. Each of these people had a large cloth bag seemed with a drawstring, on the floor next to him. One at a time they would bring forth and/or take something from their sack and make a speech about it. As I remember, the articles included a book, a hat, a pair of socks, and a pipe. The talks were discussions of the characteristics of each article. The speaker would say a few words, and then his companions would tell him to sit down, and another person would start. This procedure was repeated several times. One of the men kept laughing at everything that was said, and finally his companions told him he must stop or else leave. Then a large French door was down in front of the whole scene, and the dream ended there, as looking at a blank wall.
