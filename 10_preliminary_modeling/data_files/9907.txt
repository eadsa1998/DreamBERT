Mother (mine) is sick or just in bed and Dad is somewhere else. I see this dark-haired Greek man declare his love for her. I am shocked and I don't know whether to tell her I heard it all. Later I see Dad as we carry her over creeks on a stretcher. I see her count on her fingers the number of days--perplexed. At the Retreat Center: we register in a large place. They tell me I will teach again, but I must go through medical exams and wait a long while. As I wait, Rigo (Art School director) comes over and lies down full-length next to me and then goes to sleep. Frank laughs when he sees that and I see the same Greek guy trying to seduce a nurse in a field of gold-rimmed flowers in heaven.
