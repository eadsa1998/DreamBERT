I had this horrible dream that I was drinking with everyone from Spain and I wasn't that tipsy, but I went up to Ben and sort of got really close to him and put my hands on his shoulders. I told him I wanted to hook up with him. Later, he came up to me and told me wanted to too, but that he felt sick. Kathy and Jenny were there too. Then I woke up.
