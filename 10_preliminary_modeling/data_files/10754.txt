In this dream I found myself in a new home with apparently new decorations which I have been busily planning for what seemed to be weeks. I was married and my husband (really my fiance) was about to come home from work. I was anxiously awaiting his arrival and flitting about from room to room. I could see every detail of the furnishings. What surprised me was that we had been living in this house with only a bedroom suite and a piano (which is mine - "a dowry") but I had saved and planned and now had carpeting and some furniture. My husband knew nothing about it and the greatest surprise for him would be when I handed him a bank book $0.00. I was anxious to see his reaction.
