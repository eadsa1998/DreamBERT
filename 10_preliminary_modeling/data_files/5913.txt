I climb aboard a bus, a long luxurious travel cruiser, and look for the most comfortable seat. Find one with a long space in front for legs and I flop down. No one else seems to be coming aboard. I then hear a noise and note we are parked near a railroad track and a train--a long freight train of yellow fruit cars--is coming around the curve of tracks and the curve is so arched that the bus can be hit. Then it is jarred by the roaring train and the upper outside corner near track is smashed by train. But this doesn't bother me. I remain comfortably seated and waiting as damaged bus remains in position.
