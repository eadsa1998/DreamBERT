I came in to work and two screws broke on the dogs on one of my machines. John Serino, the boss, was actually joking and kidding with me. I was outside and looked at the sun and it was so misty that we could only see the sun and there was no glow or shine from it. I was in Rivertown and the street was covered with snow. We had piles of snow piled up. John Viatrak was up in a tree and two fellows were throwing snowballs at him. I was repeating Lincoln and someone said something about Lincoln.
