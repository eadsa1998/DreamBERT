In this dream I remember going to downtown Miami in a car. My father and another man were with me. I recall that we got downtown and parked the car at the garage where I work. We even went with the car up in the elevator. My father asked the attendant if the car would be safe, and the attendant replied that a triple lock would be used. This seemed to satisfy my father. I also recall telling the attendant that I worked at the garage part time. Then the three of us went down to the street. We were going to go eat and then watch a parade that was scheduled. It seemed to be the New Year's Eve parade, but this time it was held during the daytime. I remember that my father didn't like the restaurant that we decided to eat at and he wanted to go back and get the car and go someplace else to eat. This made me mad and I told him he could do that if he wanted to, but that I was going to eat and then watch the parade. The three of us split up and then I remember walking down Biscayne Blvd. South toward the curve in the road. This seemed to be after I had eaten. I remember seeing the Vanguards Drum and Bugle sitting in a very grassy area. I recall very vividly their red satin blouses and the bells of their instruments shining in the sun. I recall asking one of them if they were going to lead the parade and he said no, they were not. This is the last that I recall.
