I dreamt that a very good friend of mine was going to die. I was astonished and walked around in a daze. Then later, I remember she died. She went through sort of gyrations before she stopped; got up, sat down, stared. The kids had to hold her down. This took place in my dormitory. This girl is my age. The other girls in the dream were just girls in the dorm.
