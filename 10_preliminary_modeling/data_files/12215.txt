There were lots of tornadoes. I was running away from them and ended up in a bunker place. There were these parents and a kid there. The mother was called Astric and she was a quadriplegic. The kid was called Rottic and had AIDS. They all got killed. Tornadoes were going to wipe out the Earth. Rascal was near this snake. Calvin, Silas, Samantha and I were at a shop?
