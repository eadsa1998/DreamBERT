I dreamt that all of my friends had come back from a trip and that we got together to talk all night. Each one of us had a different opinion about diverse matters such as present society, progress, technology, and the dehumanization and exploitation of man. Every once in a while fights would flare up, and at other times laughter, and we all felt very happy to be seeing each other again. The place where we sat to talk was the house of one of the girls (where we normally get together).
