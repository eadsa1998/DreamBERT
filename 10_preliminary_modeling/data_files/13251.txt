I was at 'school'. I asked this girl for a muffin and she gave one to Calvin, but not to me. I offered $5 and then she gave me heaps. I was looking for this nice thing I'd tasted before and it tasted like Venetian ice-cream, but nicer and sweeter. There was a weird banana thing. Samantha was there, cooking. Ms Powell was there and I asked her for the recipe. She said "What are you going to do with the recipe?" and I was like "Uh... make them?". This girl said her name was Hermione Granger.
