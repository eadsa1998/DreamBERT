I had a lot of dreams last night, the first being that I was in the mall in Rome with Isaiah, and we were going out, but I didn't really want to be going out with him. I couldn't figure out how to break up with him. My father wanted to take a book out of the library for me on James Dean, but it turns out he had to buy it since it was a Roman library or something. Next, we were all at school, but it was a girl's school and Mrs. Persky and Mr. Chloe were married. Hermione had hooked up with Sirius and then Sirius had died, like in Harry Potter. Everyone was really mad at Hermione. And then there were some other dreams in there about Lou.
