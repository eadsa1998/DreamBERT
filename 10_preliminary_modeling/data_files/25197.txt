 I'm floating in an ocean, on a surface. The surface is like a foam pad about two inches thick, covering all the water. I'm not getting wet. I'm in a group of people. I see a meteor. Another person points it out too. It goes across the sky, which is a mixture of green and black. The sky becomes mostly green with a black shadow-like image of dangling spider-like legs. The black streaks contract. As they do the surface of the ocean breaks. I don't want to fall in. Other people do want to fall in. People want to go to Candyland, as it seems, which is a fun place, or so I hear. I don't want to go because I'll have to swim back. I fall into the water, which is very warm. It is sweet and thick, like chocolate. In this place everyone is playing a game. The goal of the game is to accumulate something, or some things, in a certain proportion. To begin, I run and climb up a series of air-filled plastic tube mountains. The area is wet, like a water park. I think I will do well. I beat the crowd up the structure and grab money and other items, including a checkbook and passport. The things I accumulate are money, power, and wealth. These clues are later no good. I clutch my hand full of paper bills and other wealth. My friend Bubba Hacker is chasing me. I run and jump off a tube structure, diving into the pool of water below. I over rotate in the dive and land on my back. Bubba follows me. <br/
