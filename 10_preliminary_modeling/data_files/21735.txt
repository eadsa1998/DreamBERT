I was pushing my brother Mike's car. I gave him a good start and then it was so dark, I could not see. I saw a pair of headlights and that's all. Then I gave him another start and he started and my car stalled. I looked up and the traffic light was green and I was trying to start my car. It finally did and I drove off to get away from the traffic because I couldn't see from the darkness. I was over to see someone I knew. I liked their home and would like to live there because I liked the location. Then I was supposed to be rich. I was so happy, it seemed such a happy and new life.
