I went to Tony S and Dorothy S's house. The level of comfort with each other that we once shared wasn't there, at least for me and Dorothy S. We sat in one room talking for awhile and then got up and went to another room - maybe the living room. I think we were having a dessert as we sat in the living room and talked. But as we went in and sat down Dorothy S said something to me about my long absence from their lives. I made a casual comment as tears began to fill my eyes, and I tried to fight them back. I knew it was time to discuss it. I don't know that I went there to discuss it, but I'm pretty sure that I went because I felt it was time to bridge the gap. As I sat there I tried to remember why I quit going to see them. Was it something they did or said? Or was it simply that I was the only one putting any effort into the friendship? I think their two younger daughters came into the room. I didn't recognize them. They had grown up and changed so much over these many years. They had several young girls with them that they were babysitting. I initially thought these young girls were their daughters and quickly realized that was impossible due to the years that had gone by. We talked for a short time about their daughters. A large group of other people showed up. I don't know if it was planned or not. At least some of the other people who showed up were family. Dorothy S began to talk with them. I didn't know if I should stay or leave. At that point I wanted to have the conversation with them about my absence, but not with all of these other people there. I decided to stay a little while longer and just see if these other people were going to leave. Tony S stayed in the room with me. He said he was feeling uncomfortable. That's unusual for him to ever be uncomfortable around someone. I mentally debated again if I should stay or go.
