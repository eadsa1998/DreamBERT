I was writing a story. Though the atmosphere was very informal. I started out working from the shack in the police station I cover, then found myself in the sixth avenue office. I was calling and calling the police to get more information, but the assholes wouldn't reveal anything. From a witness of the incident, I got shady details. There was a tour bus. There was an accident. Nazi KKK members were involved. It had the makings of a good story. The injured man was a fat Hispanic family man on vacation with his wife. I tried to talk to him, but his English was bad and I couldn't understand. I didn't know if he was talking in Spanish or Portuguese. Back in the office, I was trying to work, but several co-workers were more interested in going out after and making other plans for the day. I was working with Jenny Kee on the story. Matt and Kelly and Matt's girlfriend were off trying to do something in a meeting room, one of the ones with the glass walls, so I could kind of see inside. I didn't want to get involved. I was writing in a part of the office that reminded me of my bedroom. Simon, my editor, was working on a computer from the window sill. He was able to sit on the whole thing and work from a laptop. A co-worker came in and asked him something, but she annoyed him, so he snapped at her with a sexist comment. Dean, another editor, came in and said, "Cut that out or you'll come with on the six minute walk." I figured that meant a trip to HR. Journalists despise HR. I despise HR.
