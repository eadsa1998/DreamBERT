Ginny is gone and Ernie is sad. I want to comfort him and he resists because he's afraid it will be using me. I reassure him it's OK because I'm his friend. I tell him how Ginny came to see me and I gave up all the activities I could to be with her and I'd do the same for him. A bad man comes through and demands to know where the bathroom is. I take him down a hall. I look in to the right and see a broken bathtub and it is dirty. I look across the hall and that bathroom is messy too. I apologize for Ginny. I say, "She usually keeps it clean, but she's gone for a while."
