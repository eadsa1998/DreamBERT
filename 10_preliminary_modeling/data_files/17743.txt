My boyfriend Jeremy and I had a second, black refrigerator in the apartment.  I was looking inside trying to condense everything into one.  There were some slimy fish things in there, and I was disgusted.  We designated the black fridge as Jeremy's for his seafood products.  He pulled out some frozen starfish, supposedly his favorite.  Then we were at my parents.  My mother was fixing something to eat.  In the freezer I saw a box with a picture of bug-eyed flatworms.  On the counter were bowls with food- maybe creamed corn in them.  I asked which was mine, and put something else in the middle.  My mother said, "no, it has to be cooked first, take it out."  I tried but it wasn't going to work.  Then I was on a tour with a small group of people.  We went into a small room; it looked something like a sauna.  There was a panel on the floor and a large man jumped on it.  We went through the passage it created.  Our tour guide below took us down an aisle of what looked like a store.  He handed out things like an orange and a stretchy doll.  There was also a truncated cone in pink, with lace.  The foam rubber material was nearly everywhere.  At the end of the aisle we were in were some supposed condoms in syringes.  I rounded the corner and talked to the tour guide, a tall, blue creature- an alien.  I asked him whether he would recommend one of the ones they had, or if I should stick to human condoms - I didn't know how different alien condoms were.  He said to try the "salman kashie."  I remember seeing the "salman jahnie" on the rack.
