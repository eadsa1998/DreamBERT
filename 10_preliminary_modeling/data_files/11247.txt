I was walking down a wide highway. On the right, the buildings which I saw were huge and far apart. One building which I noticed was a large glass enclosed thing with new cars in it. In front a girl, with her back to me, was standing there. She was dressed in a white negligee. This excited me, but when I came closer I noticed that she had cotton and adhesive tape all over her body like they covered sores, so I kept walking.
