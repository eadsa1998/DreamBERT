I arrive at the front door to my house and discover that at just that moment a burglar is picking the lock in order to gain entry. I grab him from behind, shaking him roughly. "So", I say, "you thought you could break in!" Just then a policeman appears on the sidewalk and I turn the foiled burglar over to his custody.
