My mother and I are strolling outdoors on the landscaped grounds of a college campus. Suddenly the flat quadrangle we had been crossing ends abruptly at a small cliff. There is a vertical metal ladder at the edge of the cliff which my mother carefully climbs down. Now it is my turn, but I hesitate, wishing for a better way to descend. I now see that nearby there is a small cable car suspended from a loose wire cable.  I grab the car with my hands and turn it so that the door faces me. I jump inside and the car starts moving wildly. It bounces up and down and sways to either side. I wish to steer the car, but find that I can not see where I am going: my eyes are closed tightly and are unable to open.
