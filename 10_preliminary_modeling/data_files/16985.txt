I'm in a dramatic city set into a hilly topography - a bit like Edinburgh. My partner and I go walking through the city and get a bit lost in the labyrinth of streets and bridges. We may be on holiday, staying on a hotel. At night we go out drinking. I forget where we have been and find it hard to get home. My friend Sal is there too. We climb to the top of a large hill where something strange happens. I have the image of stingrays in my mind in bright luminous colors.
