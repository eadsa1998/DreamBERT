I went shopping with Mom. We were in a little shop with lots of DVDS. People were shopping in the main shop so it was quiet where we were. They had The Shining remake, but it was different. In the movie, the house was little-ish and a guy went there. On floor 217 there was a creepy monster. In the house, there was cat food and lots of water. Two guys went to check this cat in the bath.
