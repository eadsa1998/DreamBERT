Jillian and I were at 'school'. We had to go outside and throw water balloons at each other. There were also holes and they came out of them and we had to miss them. There were little and big water balloons but only the big ones counted. Seth Green came out and one point and I threw a water balloon at his foot. We went inside and she went to get our scores and I dried off in front of a fire. A teacher told me to apologize to Seth Green and I was wondering why. After we threw the last balloon (and I won) these two teachers thought we might have lied. I asked "Aren't there cameras?". There was a Runescape poster and Jillian said it sucks and I said it owns.
