A small airplane is seen flying. I seem to be flying it as it goes through its flight program. I seem to also see scenes from a picture, a movie, but just possibly readjusted with the inclusion of different character. Both of these incidents are happening at the same time. I was referring to the flying of the airplane, the landing of the airplane to someone else. The situation was as if the person I was talking to was in the picture, and I was also in the picture. It's a little bit difficult to exactly explain the setup because the feelings that were conveyed in the dream are difficult to duplicate over tape. Recognition of anyone else in the dream was next to nil. It was one of those things I knew I was talking to someone. I assumed I was referring to someone or talking to them. However, a description would almost be impossible to clearly describe.
