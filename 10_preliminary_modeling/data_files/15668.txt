I was at a stocktaking job at an IGA. I had done this one before but didn't realize until I went in. There was a muffin shop next door and there was a guy dressed as a muffin and dancing around. Esther joked that this job would take 30 hours. We had trolleys to take around with us. Elijah was there. I went to an aisle but had forgotten to put my stuff down and get a scanner.
