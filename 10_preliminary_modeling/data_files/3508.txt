I am in a huge ranch house. I live there. I am walking back through the rooms. Perhaps I heard some noise that makes me think someone is prowling around. As I pass through a series of large rooms, I notice a man in an alcove where a telephone booth is. He's not supposed to be there. I go to him and demand he leave. He's some reporter from National Public Radio (NPR) wanting to interview some things that are going on around my ranch house. I am not interested in these events, nor am I happy he's around. I tell him to leave and try to lock the window screen. I realize there are a lot of windows that are part way open and so on. It would be impossible to get him out if he kept trying to get in. He goes out to his crew. I go back to the main living room where my "dad" sits in a chair and I see a lunch pail or file box by him and realize this sneaky man has gotten permission from my father to not only do his news stories but to be in the house. I am very upset. I've decided I really don't like this good-looking man. He is in the other room, at the doorway, listening to me, smiling, because he likes me. He likes my feistiness too. So I now know he's going to be around and there's nothing I can do about it. I grudgingly go sit on the couch next to him, which is the first sign that I am realizing I do like him and am attracted to him. He is Republican and I am Democrat, but I have the feeling he is starting to make a decision to change as he is getting fed up with the Republicans. He has a packet of material, a press release kind of thing, political. He's signing his signature. A man (maybe the "dad") watches how he signs his name and does some in imitation to help him out. I go look at the signature, which is a wild scribbling in black ink, then a series of pastel colored hash marks in a sort of vague flower shape. I notice that each time he does his signature, it is uniquely different. I start to do some of the packets for him, imitating his signature.
