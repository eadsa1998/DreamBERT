I went back to sleep, and I had another dream about Jungle Park. How come I keep having all these stupid Jungle Park dreams? I dreamt that we were at Jungle Park going to a craft fair, and I was walking along with some old lady showing her some different craft booths and things, and I had this feeling like we were getting lost, but I wasn't really sure. Then we went back into the main building and I saw the old mechanical horse that I used to ride on all the time.
