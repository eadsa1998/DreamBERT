The feeling I experienced when I woke the other morning was one of depression and fear. I traced this feeling to my dream of the previous night. In the dream I suddenly found myself on the front porch of the dormitory I live in. X, with whom I am in love and date steadily, was standing at the foot of the porch steps and asked me out of a clear sky for his identification bracelet. He said he was in love with someone he had just met and that is all there was to it. This shocked me immensely and I begged and pleaded with him, but he would not listen. I ran into the house and brought out the bracelet, then very ceremoniously I fastened it on his wrist. He left without a word and the next thing I knew, I saw him in Mill Creek Park in Youngstown, Ohio, with this girl. A horrid feeling of lonesomeness, longing, and envy came over me. I burst into tears and began to run. I ran and ran for ages it seemed, then I woke to find this lost, depressed feeling still prevalent. It lasted through the day until I saw X again and told him about the dream.
