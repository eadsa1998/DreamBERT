 I'm deer hunting at Grandpa and Grandma Redding's old farm. I'm using a small bow with wooden arrows. There is another bow there, with single strings. I see some deer out by the pine trees near the mailbox. I take a bow and arrows out of the case. I walk around the house to the big porch, where the deer were walking. I get there and my friends Stephen and Franco Ramos are there. The deer walk really close by. I'm not sure if it's okay for me to shoot. Stephen looks with bulging eyes, indicating to me I should shoot, but he doesn't say anything. I pull back the bow and shoot at one of the two does from my hip. The arrow is short: 12-16 inches long. I hit the deer high on the hindquarter. It runs away. It will live, which makes me glad because I don't want to wound a deer. Grandpa calls in the deer, and says we hit one but it got away. He plays with fishing weights and jigs in his fingers as he talks. I'm really excited about hunting since right away I shot at a deer. I see a big buck with a huge rack! I stalk the deer, waiting for it to move. It gets spooked and runs away. I'm still watching the two does that I shot at from across the field. My grade school classmate Rita Bauer comes and starts chopping up vegetables for a salad. I'm mad that she is making so much noise, and I try to quietly make her leave, which she won't do. <br/
