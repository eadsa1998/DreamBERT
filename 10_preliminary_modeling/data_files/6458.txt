I am sitting at a 4-partition desk like they have got at the junior college library, intended for studying. I'm sitting in front of a large window of some sort, at this desk, 'working on my style'. Laura and I have dinner there and she leaves. I get frustrated with the stupid blue desk lamp -- it keeps flickering on and off -- and so I throw it out the window. I turn on the computer and hook it up to the window (which I'm using as a movie screen) to watch an animated movie, which is done all in blue tints. I put the movie in because the box said it was "Heartwarming". But -- a hick cop on the street shines his light in. Apparently I'm violating some sort of law by watching a blue film. I must stop. Not wanting to stop, I simply pull the shades. Now on the screen I get a Windows error box. It says: "Stop. 3 Minutes." I stop the movie and wait. Another message: "Revert To Wood. Now." Everything goes black. I wake, inexplicably scared.
