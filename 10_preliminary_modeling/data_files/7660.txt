We went on a trip with a group of friends [unknown]. We were in our hotel room/suite, lying on the floor. I was on top of him. We were kissing and laughing. We were having a good time, though it was nothing sexual. Some of the men friends with us came to our room. I decided to go into another room and study for a little while. I had books and papers spread out all over a chair with ottoman, like my black leather on in the living room. I decided it was time to stop studying and get ready to go because we were all going out. I started my shower and got out to get something. When I did, I realized that a couple of the men were waiting to use our bathroom so they could also get ready. I took one of them to our other bathroom so he could use it. The next thing I know I am in the shower and Tom Cu and one of the other men come in the bathroom with me to start getting ready. Tom Cu is upset because Mary Cu said we're all going to be late now. It was my fault because I had waited too long to start getting ready and then tied up the bathroom. I apologized. I got the sense that he wasn't going to stay mad very long. Still, I said, I'm sorry Rick with kind of an attitude. I don't know why I called him Rick. Later, I thought I should have told him that everyone could go without me and I would stay, study, and watch TV.
