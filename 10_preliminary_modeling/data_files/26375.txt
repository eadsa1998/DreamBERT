 I walk into a video store. It's about 3:00am. I have permission to check out movies: I know someone who works here. The lights are on and other people are there who also have special access. I walk by some computers. There is a woman working there. I wonder what will happen if I don't check out the movie properly and the alarm sounds as I exit. I'll feel awkward trying to explain that someone gave me permission. There seems to be one man in charge of the store. He goes to the door when someone rings the bell. I walk on and start to look at photograph and wedding albums where there are many photographs of naked couples. The couples are covered in blankets or bubbles, their bodies partially obscured. I see my cousin Helen Ralston's wedding album. I look in it and can't decide which woman is Helen. There is a blond and a brunette woman. The brunette woman is much prettier and I hope it is she. I find more photographs that make me realize that Helen is the brunette. She is beautiful.
