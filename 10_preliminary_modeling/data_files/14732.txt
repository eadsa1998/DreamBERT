I was talking to Dad. We went past a takeaway place and a lady served us and she knew him. He ordered 8 of some chicken thing. He said she got angry at him the other day and made him eat cold chicken things. I told him about this guy playing Rock Band and said that I put a link on Facebook and to go to 2.30 minutes and he said he just looked at it now. He couldn't get to it because it had been deleted or there was maintenance.
