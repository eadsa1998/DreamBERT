I'm in a park with my friend Rick and part of it has been closed off so that all the people (there's a lot of handicapped people here for some reason) are stuck in one end of the park. We are camping out without a tent and there are people everywhere. I am bleeding heavily (on my period), so I have to go to the washroom which is the typical campground building and I find a shower stall which is somewhat clean to change pads. I thought my pad was soaked but it's almost dry. My other pads got wet somehow so I have to sue a pantiliner and I'm afraid it won't be enough to contain the blood. A woman ranger comes in to put soap in the dispenser and walks in on me.
