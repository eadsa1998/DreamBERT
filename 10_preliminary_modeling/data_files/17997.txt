I was in college, in the lunch line with my former friend Jenna and her older sister.  I was thinking how it was surprising, it wasn't a dream, that Jenna and I were friends again.  Moby was at the school.  I had a very deep respect, almost a crush on him.  We had ice cream.  I took sorbet because Moby did, being vegan, but I took a dab of cookies 'n' cream, too.  I was going to make a sincere effort to eat more vegan.  We were taking a trip somewhere as a group.  We passed a snake of some sort; I think Moby's favorite animal was said to be a white viper.  I was riding a bike of some sort (as Moby?) along a Cliffside across the street from a housing tract.  The front tire was wet and leaving marks on the ground.
