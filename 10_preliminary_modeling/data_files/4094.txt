["Baby Bird On My Shoulder"]  Charla wants to buy a baby bird. It is cuddled under it's mommy's body. We are outdoors looking a a few birds that seem to be roaming free. Yet it is a pet store. The birds are the size of ostriges without the long legs. Emus, maybe. Charla tries to get the baby out from under its mommy. It doesn't want to come. So I act as a distraction to get the mommy busy elsewhere. Charla captures the baby. I carry it on my left shoulder. It doesn't fight, rather it cuddles up in my neck and enjoys the comfort of being close. We see several display cases with bird cages and bird food in them. I check prices and am surprised and not unhappy about how much things cost. I check another case. A metal bird cage costs 51 dollars. That's the cheapest one. I return to the first case where I originally had thought it was too expensive glad to see it costs less than the second case of things. We get a package with cage and food.
