I had come across the cutest penguin.  He showed himself to be intelligent and I named him Confucius.  He was large, an empire penguin.  He was about 3 feet tall and an armful for hugging.  He could definitely comprehend what I was saying.  He provided great companionship and I was happy to have him with me on the boat we were on.
