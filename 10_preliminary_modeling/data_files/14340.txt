It was my birthday or a little while after. We were at Mom's old house and I was in my room on my laptop/computer. My aircon was still in the window, but it was hanging out quite a bit, so I pulled it in a little. One of Mom's friends had given her a birthday present to give to me. It was a bracelet. I started complaining in disgust and told her to get rid of it. She told Ezra to put it in my room and I said to put it in the bin. I used one of those metal grabby hands to pick it up and I threw it in the bin in the kitchen. There were cones with chocolate eggs in them and I was eating one.
