I'm at home and call this number where, after you call, some lady calls back. I thought I'd get in trouble for calling for some reason. Then I'm playing music in my cellar, and I seem to remember something about Kim or Gail at my house, but I'm not sure. Then I'm in the woods, or somewhere like it, and these two guys are fighting over who should get to "carry the cross." It actually sounded like they were fighting over who got to "be Jesus". They want me to decide for them. One was 16 and the other was 26, and the younger one was mad because he thought I'd discriminate based on age.

Then I'm at home, but it's not really my house (Jamie's house in the dream was really my house
