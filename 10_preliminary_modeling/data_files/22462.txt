This time I dreamed I was where they were filming a movie. The hills were green with little yellow flowers and at the bottom there was a lake of which half was built like a swimming pool and the other wasn't. One had very clear water and the other didn't. A boy and a girl were playing their roles, but then a fight got started and we all ended up fighting with some intruders.
