In this dream I was standing with my ticket in my hand in an outside railroad station waiting for my train. Next I found myself going with a handsome man in a brown suit (age 35-6) into another train. I was aware of what I was doing. I had missed my train and was taking another with this man. I think I must have known the man in the dream-but outside of the dream, I don't. We went into the Pullman and ordered some drinks.
