I was buying a loaf of bread. It was a long French loaf. I was pricing a new motor for my car and it was $300 for a motor and grill. I was selling some copper. One of the pulleys were too short on the motor and I gave it to the man selling the motor. He looked at it and the old one and nodded his head of approval. I was walking along with Rose Lasko. I held onto her hand and I was floating along with her three inches above the ground. We stopped in a restaurant. She went into the other room and I sat with another girl. I looked up at the sky and it was midday and it was dark. I saw some stars. I told the girl, "This is the darkest day I can remember." I drove down a side road and the ruts were so deep that cars were sliding on the ground, about three feet up on the ground and the ruts were down. It was solid earth about three feet high and as wide as from right wheel to left wheel. The wheels spinning against the earth moved the car ahead. I came to cars coming the opposite way and the fellow got out of his car and said, "You better go back on the main road or you will be stuck in the jam up ahead." So I backed up to the main road. I looked on the bed and I saw tiny bugs moving around. I scooped one up and he was like a beetle fair-sized. I tried to squeeze him with my fingernail and finally did.
