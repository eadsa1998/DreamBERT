I am running in fear. Something is after me. I run across the hall to Theresa's door. I call out, "Theresa, Help me." I am temporarily covered by the protective wings of a huge bird. I enter the house and call for Theresa. Her family comes downstairs and asks coldly, "What do you want?" They block me from Theresa. I must run. I go across the hall. It is in hot pursuit. I make a phone call. It doesn't help. I see it. It is Burt Lancaster. He has a huge rifle. I shoot at him at the same time he fires at me. He won't die. I feel fear.
