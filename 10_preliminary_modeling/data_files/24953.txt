 I dreamed about the characters from the television show "Blossom". Blossom's father is in the kitchen with a woman. It's around lunchtime. They are going to have sex. Blossom and her boyfriend come home over the lunch hour, but not to eat. The father says to the woman something like, "How are people going to know we love each other if we don't prove it?" He is implying that they prove it by having sex. Meanwhile, in the living room, Blossom is hearing the same words from her boyfriend. He is a physically small, unsure, afraid kid. Blossom is in her pajamas. I see the potential trouble: the father and woman friend are going to walk through the living room to get to the bedroom. Blossom and her boyfriend will be there, and will get into trouble.
