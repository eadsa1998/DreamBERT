I was in San Francisco and something happened and 'they' wanted to keep an eye on me, so sent PDQ to kind of kidnap me and keep eyes on me 24/7. The first place he took me was this boat or something and I tried sending information that I was 'near the bay' and that this tall building landmark was in sight. Then he took me to this safehouse place. He gave me this weird food to eat. After 48 hours or whatever, they were satisfied and let me go. PDQ said he was impressed I didn't kick up a fuss and made some weird joke about me trying to eat the lid of some food.
