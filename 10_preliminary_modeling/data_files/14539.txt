I realized that it was the 8 June and so I was going to get The Sims 3. I was on the computer and on some site which had Eugene's profile on it. It said he liked The Sims 3 (I had been on here before, and it used to say Sims 2). Mom was babysitting Amelia. There was a pub and another shop next to each other. I had somehow transferred a problem to the pub and something in there started hissing and someone tricked a bum (can't read it properly). Also, someone asked me to get something out of their car and I asked if their car was the "fat brown thing?". But then I was supposed to go to the daycare because their son had it. I went over and was getting the thing they wanted out of the son's pants. His name was Devon. I was then outside a shop and I was thinking it was Midvale shops. A lady got off a motorbike and had a gun. I pretended not to notice and walked to the street. I walked across with some other people. Nicolas was in the crowd and saw me and started running, saying to get away from him. I ran after him and called out "Oi! Nicolas!". I looked behind me and I saw someone on the bike coming after me. I went down a path which was on a hill, and then there was a loop. I tried to call Mom but I couldn't, so I text her instead. Then I was lying on my stomach, pulling myself along these pipes and it was a tight fit between them. There were lots of others behind me and they complained about me going slow. When I got to the end, there were copies of Sims 3 on USB's (there were four of them). They were a weird shape. I checked one of them, but it wasn't on it. The second one had Sims 3 and the first season of Angel. I used my iPod to transfer them over.
