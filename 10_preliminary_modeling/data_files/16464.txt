Mom and I had to get on a plane, not surprisingly, but in the dream we had this flight scheduled for 7:30 in the morning. But you know how Mom is, she diddles and she daddles and she doddles and she doodles, and we didn't get out of the house until 9:30, so we had to take, I mean we had to reschedule to the 10:05 flight. Now in my dream the way it worked is, it would be just like a bus, you catch whichever one you can catch, but you know in life it doesn't work that way. And so we were at the airport getting ready for this flight, and I think we were shopping around in a few of those little stores that they have, and I can't remember a whole lot, but something happened that made us miss that one too. I think we couldn't get on it because our bags were too big, and we had to take one that left at 2:30. And I think before I woke up, we were finally on that flight, but we weren't really going to get into town until 7:30 at night, which really we're getting there at like 6:00, or no, we're getting there at 4:45, but we probably won't get to Aunt Christine's house until 6:00. But in my dream we wouldn't even land until 7:30, and I was thinking, "Oh, my gosh, what a terrible chain of domino effects this was -- diddle doddle, diddle doddle, and we didn't get out until late. Oh, my gosh." And that's really all there is to it. Although this dream has its literal implications about us getting on a plane and all, I think this dream referred more to life and what I feel I'm missing out on. I guess I just feel like now my dependence will never disappear, and what I could miss out on and that I might finally get to my destination, but it might be much later in life than I had hoped. So that's that.
