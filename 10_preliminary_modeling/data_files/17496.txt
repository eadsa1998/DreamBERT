A friend and I were wronged.  I was sitting at the table trying to explain it, and I almost said 'fucking' I was so upset.  I didn't even remember the initial wrong we had been accused of, since we hadn't done anything wrong.  I got my philosophy reader to look it up.  When I got back, the family was in the rumpus room watching an odd version of the Brady Bunch with Christopher Walken and Alyssa Milano.  There was chaos and a leopard-like photo shoot.  The family could all get this yellow or blue glimmer in the corner of their eyes and affect something.  They all started controlling a record and soon you could see the vinyl streams from their eyes to the record.  I was upset that nobody cared about my problem.  A girl had flirted with my friend and he made a face back to her.  After that we were ostracized.  I moved to the Hebrew class and I didn't understand anything being said.  The other students were trying to get me to insult myself, that much I knew.  Passing the "I am" words around the room, and some guy gave it to me.  He threw an orange pen at me.  At this point I couldn't even care.  The pen hit me in the right eye.  I just covered it with my hand.  When I looked in the mirror I couldn't see my eyeballs, but just the bloodshotness where the pen had hit.  At some point I decided that when the teacher came by I'd throw a hacksaw at him.  I ran it across several times but with no luck.  Somehow he was able to mentally manipulate me and I used the hacksaw on my right pinky.  Then, I was actually myself, with the male 'me' that I had been.  He was a goalie in a soccer game.  I did my best to help him, but I couldn't do much.
