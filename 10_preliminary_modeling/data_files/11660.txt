I was playing catch with Al (my frat brother) on a paved highway. Suddenly a jeep pulled up behind me and an army captain was bawling me out for not saluting him. (I had suddenly become a sergeant.) The captain was in his twenties, but I do not recall his face. He was short and heavy set. He further chewed me out for not having my shirt buttoned. He told me I would have to pull extra guard duty for a week. The extra duty would only be from 7:30 to 8:30. Then I was strolling down Abington, towards a Mather class, and I (once again a civilian) remarked to myself that this was only a dream.
