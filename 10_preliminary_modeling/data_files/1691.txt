My male attendant and I are standing next to an old junky car. He tells me to wait, stand there and wait while he arranges the broken front seat. He isn't very effective and it takes a long time, I am annoyed. I go use the women's bathroom and come back. He says "Oh, I thought it was broken." I said, "No, that wasn't the men's room. The plumbing is broken there. I used the women's room and it worked fine."
