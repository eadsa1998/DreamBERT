["Quilts."] I find some quilts and remember that I had made them a long time ago. One has autographs and sayings written on the back. I look closely and see that I had asked people who had used the quilt to sign the quilt with comments. I look at them trying to see what they said. I am in a large nearly empty room. A young girl, maybe Caroline as a child is there. She is crying. I say to her sympathetically, come here and I will hug you. She shakes her head no and walks away from me turning her body away from me. She doesn't want to be hugged. I respect that and continue sitting on the floor, watching her. I say again Can I hug you? She nods her head sadly and walks hesitantly into my embrace. We hug for a long time. Then she moves to indicate she is done and I release her. Then I stand and I am dancing contact improv. I pick up a small boy in my arms like he is a puppy. I balance him and dance slowly around. He wants down and I put him on the floor sill curled up in a fetal ball position. A man is outside the open door and wants me to go out there on the porch with him. I go outside in the bright sunlight.
