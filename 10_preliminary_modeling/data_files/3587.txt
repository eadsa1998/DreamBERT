I am staying at a house, perhaps my mother's house. Ellie is there as well. There are many rooms but I sleep in a tiny one twin size bed, if fact, I don't even sleep in the bed, I am uncomfortably curled up in my wheelchair and sleeping. Ellie starts to move her things to a bigger nicer room and it occurs to me I could do that too. I mention to my mother that I'd like to hire a part time helper as I can't do things for myself and would like to be comfortable. and I want to move to a nicer bigger room and sleep comfortably on a bed.
