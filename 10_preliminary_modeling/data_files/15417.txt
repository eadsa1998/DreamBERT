I went through McDonald's drive thru with Ezra, Selena and Lorelei. First we were walking and then we were in a car. It was night, but we got breakfast. I had a burger too. Ezra's patty was red and mine had egg in it. I grabbed them and went inside and complained to the manager. She said it would be best to talk to the person who made them and it was Kayleigh. I said 'I know you're friends with Ezra'. She called Paul and after one ring and no answer, she hung it up. She listened to my complaint and looked sorry. I said something about Mom and she remade my patty. A guy in there mentioned to Ezra that he liked me (saying that I was hot) and Ezra teased me and the guy about it. Ezra filmed on his phone and got the guy to say "will you have sex with me?" and I said "go away".
