I was on the beach and playing in the shallow end of the water. There was a little jellyfish nearby. A stingray was also hovering around and I was a bit nervous about the stingray, but not the jellyfish. The tide kept coming in further and I kept moving further back and Dad, who was in the water, joked that I'd end up off the beach.
