I have a cousin (male) whom I haven't seen in ten years. He was Satan and I was having sex with him for money. My mother kept telling me not to read his letters but I secretly did anyway. Whenever Wes (my boyfriend) was in the room, Satan stayed away. Then there was a bunch of people in my apartment trying to keep Satan away and protect me but I kept trying to get out. I didn't want to be protected.
