I was in the car with Mom and we were on our way to her place, but had only just left home. She stopped on the side of the road. This car pulled up next to us, a car length away with two people in the car. Then, another car pulled up in the middle of us, and this one had Lafayette (True Blood) in it. I said "Two of em!". They did their thing and then I was in the back seat. Mom put this envelope on the back floor on my side. I looked at it. She had made it up. It said Sasha Wyatt with a face on it. It was to me from Westland University and was green. It had money in it and she gave it to me because it was a lot of money and she couldn't do anything with it. I was then at her house and I was complaining that I wasn't going to get into university because I was going to get a low TER. She said that it was my fault and I said I know, but that I could've done well in the exams but it wasn't going to boost me enough. She asked why I put veterinary science first and I said that it was still what I wanted to do most though I knew I wasn't getting in. Then I was Dad and Ezra in the car. We saw Samantha walking on Princess Rd at the park, so Dad asked if she wanted a lift. She got in the back, behind the passenger. The time capsule was there so I moved it. I had written who I had liked on a small piece of paper and it was on the top and said "Kohler" and I was worried she was going to say something. She lived at an apartment block and I walked her up. I kept leaving my bag and running back for it. Her father didn't like people coming into the area so we left.
