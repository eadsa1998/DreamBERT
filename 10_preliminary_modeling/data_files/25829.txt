 I'm going up a mountain, trying to get to the highest point. I climb and climb. I get to the top. There are people there. Snow is on the ground. The view is beautiful. I see down upon the clouds. I'm walking and then I am in the back of a pickup truck, which is surrounded by fog and clouds, so I can't see the ground. The truck drifts in the spot like a boat anchored in the wind. There is a kid that I know on a snowboard. I say something about skiing but realize the snow is soft and mushy. The snow is deep. The whole area is very pretty. I go into a garage-like space. A man follows me, parking some sort of vehicle there, so I must move out of the way. I go into a gymnasium-like area, where there are several different rooms in which activities can take place. There is one activity where a small hard ball is hit up against a wall. There are two people playing this game, and some spectators.
