I was saying "miss" and then there must have been an interruption/commotion. After, I think someone answered me with a rude remark. It was some sort of takeoff on a play and the part that I was reading, but the surroundings were not correct. It came and went quickly, or so it seemed. P.S. I think that I was so excited about this new dream journal that I tried to control my dream too much. That's why I can't elaborate. Setting: In a green room instead of a stage, as if the play was in real life. More like an office painted green. Characters: I was there, but as a different lady. Everyone else was unfamiliar. I think they were all busy, bustling around, with no time for my lady, even though she worked there with them. Feelings and Thoughts: Neutral. I don't think much of it. It seems normal, and this particular one, unlike others that I've had in the past, doesn't seem to be trying to get a message through to me.
