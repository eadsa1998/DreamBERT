I am upstairs getting dressed; I wear heavy horn-rimmed glasses. I see a picture of a nude reclining and want to paint it, but am too lazy to get started. -- Then I go downstairs, to the front porch, where Wendy is sitting by a small table where she and DANA had been painting. Dana has just left with Zena. I ask Wendy, 'Why didn't you call me?"
