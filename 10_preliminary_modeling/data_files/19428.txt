There were these three little girls who looked very sad and I asked them if they wanted to play. They said yes. I asked them why they were sad, and they said because their owner was mean and all they were made to eat was ice cream. I said, "You mean your mother?" and they said no, their "owner." "We are not real children. We are 'dolls'." I couldn't believe it. They were so real. I decided to help them get away, but then the mean lady came home. She was so ugly, very skinny. She reminded me of a drug addict. She said, "You can't take my children," and I got in a fight with her. I was holding her down. One of the dolls called a department store and had a more improved doll sent over, one that could eat and digest anything. When it arrived she said, "I'm your baby now," and I let the woman go and we left.
