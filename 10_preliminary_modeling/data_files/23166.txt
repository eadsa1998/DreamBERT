I was at the large home of a patrician couple maybe 10 years older than me.  They were so similar to the Spears that I asked them if they knew the Spears.  They said they didn't, and I felt foolish about having asked.  Why would they, just because they are similar?  The woman made some coquettish remarks-something like how handsome I was-and her husband just grunted.  I didn't know if she was being playful or whether there was serious intent behind it.  Clouds started to gather and darken outside, it looked like there was going to be a serious storm.  I saw ragged wisps of cloud hanging down along the edges of the clouds, and I went out to see if there was going to be a tornado.  As soon as I looked out the door I saw a funnel not far from the house-a narrow one.  I ran inside and told the couple that there wasn't time to go to the basement-just to get under something.  The wife lay down in the kitchen, the husband lay under a table in the living room, and I lay near him with my hands over my head.  Fortunately, the tornado missed us.
