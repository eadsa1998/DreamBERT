I am at the coast at a seminar thing. A lecturer, a famous man, is preparing to lecture. I've been to several of his workshops and am returning for this last one. I see I'm early, maybe a half hour early, and not many people have arrived yet. It is outdoors and I decide to secure myself a place near the front on the grass. I lay something down on the ground because the patch I choose is a bit muddy. The lecturer tells me to move back a bit, as he'll need more room to conduct the lecture (like a symphony conductor). I move back; I am annoyed. He didn't have to tell me in that cold way; I'm quite willing to be helpful. Now it's over and I and the other women are returning to our home, only when we left home to come to the workshops we were girls and had left our toys out. When we returned, we were women. I start to put away the toys, only I still want to play with them and decide it is OK to keep them around for when I feel playful. Then Ginny calls and says she's booked us for a weekend at the coast to attend this really neat workshop entitled "The forest and the river." "Maybe," she says, "you're all tired out from the last workshop and don't want to go." I say, "No, it's OK." Then we can stay Saturday night and just have fun at the coast the next day. Ginny kind of hesitates, then agrees and I realize maybe she hadn't planned to pay for both nights.
