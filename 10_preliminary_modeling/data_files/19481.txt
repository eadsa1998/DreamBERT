I was paying grocery bills at 3 stores at 15 and H St. One bill was Muese's and amounted to $8.00, all items being given on a yellow charge slip. In paying grocery man I noticed that he put the money in his pocket. We argued about the propriety of this, and I called him crooked, being convinced he had cheated me. One of the clerks in the store had a cancerous nose -- most of the nose having already been destroyed. Went away and reported to Muese, who thought we would be able to straighten things out, but I was doubtful, and told M. the man had put the money into his pocket.
