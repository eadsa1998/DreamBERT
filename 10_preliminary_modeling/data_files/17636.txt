I dreamt about my deceased paternal grandpa Ernest.  He was there at some family gathering. Then, he was dying. Everybody else just pretty much stood around. I think my father said something to him, and I knelt down and gave him a hug and said goodbye...I was happy I got to say goodbye, but I was upset that nobody else seemed to care- it didn't seem right that someone should go and their family doesn't seem to care. Then I remember something of crawling into a little cubbyhole.
