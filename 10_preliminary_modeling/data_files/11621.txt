I dreamed once again that I was driving my wife's automobile which I do, not infrequently. All of a sudden the auto began to spin crazily in circles, as one spins when skidding in snow. I was overcome with anxiety for I anticipated an accident. As much as I tried I could not control the auto nor could I see where we were going. The windows were frosted and therefore a view was not to be had. After I could hear the screeching of brakes and awaited the crash but nothing happrned. At length the auto stopped spinning and I again pursued my original course.
