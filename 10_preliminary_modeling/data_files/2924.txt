I own a huge house or apartment building and now have lots of renters, who have broken the hinges on my K-mart special appliances. It is time to eat and I seem to have a husband and a son. I go to the glass doors of a freezer unit, like in a store, only it's for home, and open the door, angry that the door isn't properly shut and the food could spoil. I get a hunk of frozen hamburger meat out of a Costco-like package. I take it to my husband who makes patties out of it in the shape of sleeping people, their heads resting on the hamburger buns. I decide that I'll charge each renter $5 a month on upkeep of the appliances and need to start collecting the money. I shout to them to come on over and start paying. I have a clipboard with lots of forms and papers and I struggle to find the right one so I can record who paid. One older man hasn't paid his rent and I'm trying to get that too. It's a lot of work and I'm not enjoying this experience.
