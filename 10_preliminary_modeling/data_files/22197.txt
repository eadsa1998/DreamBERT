I don't remember my dream very well, but I will try to be as precise as possible. I believe it was about my studying at a university in the United States. I was at a meeting with a group of friends. We were discussing different aspects of life, especially politics. Later we were joined by a group of girls and the discussion became very interesting and everyone participated in it. We were forced to end it because we had to go to classes. I left with a lot of books under my arm. I felt very happy. I had very long hair, like Paul McCartney's, and I looked taller than before. I was walking through a corridor that was filled with boys and girls. I had made a lot of friends in the brief time I had been there. I felt more independent with that way of life (I am an advocate of the American system; boys and girls are more liberal, unbiased and honest). I felt complete. While I walked to class, I met many of the friends I had made there. They all greeted me. I felt very happy. And that is all I remember.
