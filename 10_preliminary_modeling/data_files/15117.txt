Mom and I were walking outside. I had a lot of money in my pocket as well as my debit card. There was a group of guys and they stopped us and told us to give them our money. I jumped over a wall and ran. There was a big building, like an empty shed that looked like a classroom inside. I had a fake subscription. I turned into a bird and I had to touch the tip of my tongue to my top lip to help keep the transformation. I thought it was similar to trying to get lucid.
