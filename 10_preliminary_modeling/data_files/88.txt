Bobbie is working at a kind of carrel, imagine a bigger micro reader or charge machine, where it comes over your head. What she's doing involves cards, or something to move about, and I'm coming in from the next room, expecting to do something else, but I can see I really should be helping her. At least, I have the impression that she expects me to, or at least wishes I would but that isn't said. I don't want to, and I'm wondering if I can get away without it. There's an identical carrel behind her, and I start to do something at it. Bobbie goes out for a minute.
