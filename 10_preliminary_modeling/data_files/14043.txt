I was with some friends on a street and we were trying to hitchhike. It was early evening. We were thirsty. Eugene was there and we were going out. I was thinking that we never made it out of this and were never found. This guy pulled over and I thought he was dodgy but this girl and I went to get in. The girl sat in the front and I opened the back door to get in and I said "Eugene" and he quickly came over. We were in the middle of the back. As we drove, I put my arm around him and he did the same and said "it's ok". The guy did something and when he stopped, I jumped out and ran and Eugene followed. The guy stabbed the girl. I got really puffed out. I kept looking behind to make sure Eugene was with me and the guy was close behind. There were houses around, but they were all empty I think. I was trying to text our other friends to tell them not to get in his car so that we didn't all die. We did manage to get away.
