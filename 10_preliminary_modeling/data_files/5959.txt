I am visiting a museum in a small city located in a vast desert. In the center of a large room stands a dinosaur skeleton which greatly impresses me. "When did people first realize how big dinosaurs were?", I wonder out loud. "It must have been very exciting for the first person who found such large bones!" There is an expert (paleontologist) standing next to me in the museum who replies, "You can see yourself where the bones come from." Upon hearing these words, I run out from the city into an endless desert plain of red-brown sandy soil blown about by a constant wind. Soon I come upon a quarry which is rectangular in shape and perhaps six feet deep. I walk down some steps dug into the ground and look around in the pit. There is a vague awareness of other people in the quarry also looking around. I quickly find some bones lying on the ground, and in the excitement of this discovery, I go running back to the city. I reach a modest ridge just on the outskirts, and get my first clear look at the highly varied architecture of the city, which appears to have grown in my absence. There are buildings in the styles of many ages, and as I leap off the ridge and joyfully bounce from the top of one building to the next, I imagine that I am jumping from century to century. As I jump from the roof of a two-story 18th Century Colonial brick house to the top of a 20th Century glass skyscraper high in the clouds, I wonder, "If only they (the dinosaurs) could see how much we (humans) have accomplished!"
