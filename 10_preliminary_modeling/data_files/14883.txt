I was at Nana's. She went out because of an emergency, but it wasn't. I heard this thing about how Ryan Kwanten had recently purchased 3 TV shows and one had already been cancelled. Another was a reality show where the people do competitions and get eliminated. I watched a bit of it and it was good. Then I was watching The Great Dictator. It was actually funny and good, which I thought was surprising since it was Chaplin. There was a jetty and people were walking onto a boat. Chaplin was behind them and by the time he got there, the boat had left and Hitler's had arrived. Hitler got off and Chaplin got on. The crew thought he was Hitler. Then I was outside somewhere and I'm not too sure what was going on, but I was with Seth (The O.C). They were after us and we were trying to get on a boat. We went through a house and into the backyard and we were getting shot at. We went into the pool. We lifted our heads a bit later and there were more shots. I had trouble staying underwater. I managed to get somewhere with cover and we 'fell' over the fence. As we went over we saw Summer (The O.C) in another backyard. They shot and we saw bodies in the pool. There was a road next to the house she was at and there were three rows of houses. There was an alley next to us. She unlocked a gate and I was now Seth and I ran to the end of the alley. She had trouble opening the gate and then we hugged and kissed on the lips. But then I was me, but not, and I was actually going out with Seth. We left and there was this thing were people heard something and then went into groups of three (and no-one knew anyone else). We were going to pretend that was going on if we were caught. We went back onto the street and it was in America and these people were celebrating. But they were actually the bad guys. I went to go surrender to them at one point, but they started coming at me so I quickly 'flew' around this corner.
