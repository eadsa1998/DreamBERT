 There is a boy from southeast Asia on a bridge over a river. He has groceries/food, which may be in a sled. The owner of the boy will shoot him if the boy jumps into the water. Many metal musket balls will be fired into the water if he jumps. The boy walks slowly off to the other end of the bridge. It is kind of dark, and the owner probably won't see the boy move slowly. When he gets near the end of the bridge, he runs. He makes it to the other side. I meet the boy on the other side of the bridge, where there is a high rocky cliff below us. We find a spot to jump. I tell the boy to go for it. The boy jumps, and his the rocks on the sloping cliff, tumbles down, and dies. I am horrified. The dead body of the boy floats to the surface to the river. I feel guilty and ashamed. I didn't jump after the boy, to try to save him or to get into the river.
