I was in a pick-up truck with my friend Marcie. I left her there because I needed to go get something. As I was walking away, I fell down and got all tangled up in something and couldn't get up. I saw another truck from the floor and as I looked up I saw a man wearing plaid pants. A foreboding feeling came over me and I knew this was not good. The man walked over to the truck where Marcie was and I knew that he was going to rape her. He seemed to be a middle-aged Hispanic man. Then suddenly Marcie turned into my mother. I felt really helpless like I was just observing this attack but couldn't do anything to stop it. Then I was in a hotel or something with my family and Marcie and her mother. I felt really guilty and I was crying. Suddenly an overwhelming sense of bliss encompassed me and I was in a car (this old car my dad used to have when I was little). I was in the car with my entire family driving in the ocean, being propelled on top of the waves.
