I was walking along with the traffic and a policeman was also with me. I took off a part of a job finished and he would inspect it. I took off about four pieces of finished product and he inspected them. Then he said, "Let the traffic roll on or we will bottle it up." I looked at it as it rolled on in two lanes and the road was muddy. We looked at an old mansion. I noticed one of the small decorative small steeples was missing part of the top. Then a city official stopped on the road by the mansion. He knelt on the ground and said a prayer for the official who lived in the mansion. I thought that was a very wonderful thing for a man to do.
