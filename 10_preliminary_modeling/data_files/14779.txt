There was this hot guy who I think I was dating. Tony Soprano (The Soprano's) was his best friend. He thought he was alive, but they told him he was dead and he realized. But then they were in a motel room. Tony was under the bed with a slit throat and then he came back to life. We kept telling the guy that he was dead for a while. Then I was in a big pool that had like, beds on the side. It was fancy. He sat next to me and I told him Tony was dead. I was crying and he did too. I leant on his arm. Mom mentioned something about 'strawberry corn field'.
