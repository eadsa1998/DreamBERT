I was an medical intern, one of a small team of interns. There were learning exercises that we were to complete as a group, though we each had to figure out the solution ourselves. I was becoming increasingly frustrated because I was having trouble doing so. Part of my frustration is that I am usually the first one to get the answer but this particular time I was the last. I kept trying and not getting it. I was getting so frustrated. I could tell the others were watching me, almost with pity. I hated that. I never did figure it out.
