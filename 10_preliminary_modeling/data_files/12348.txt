I was at school. Evelyn did some weight thing and it said 42/52. There were chairs and something and glass. There was a big screen showing people. We were outside sitting on grass. I was sitting next to Calvin and Seamus sat next to me. Elijah joined later. There was a dog looking for someone and it got the wrong people. I was wondering where Dmitri was.
