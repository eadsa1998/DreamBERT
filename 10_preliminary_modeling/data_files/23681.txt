Important dream, more substance, neat things happening but I can't remember any of them.  Surroundings unusual.  I go downstairs.  A man is there who I like.  Events I can't remember, playing.  I get on elevator and just before the door closes, I pull the man in too.  We go up.  We are happy, smiling together.  Rob? or Dan?
