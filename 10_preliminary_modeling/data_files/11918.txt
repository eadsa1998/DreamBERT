Ezra and Jayson read my diary. I found out because they kept taking my stuff and they took two pictures of Timothy Olyphant from my diary and then they showed me them by giving me a bag full of stuff they had taken. I was really annoyed but they didn't say anything about it, they just smiled evilly. Then they wanted a million dollars off Peter Gallagher. I had his email and told him and then I had to go with Mom, Ezra and Jayson to somewhere. Also, it was the last day of school in Year 7 and Mr Macklin gave out all our work and I didn't bring it home, but Mom and had gone and got it.
