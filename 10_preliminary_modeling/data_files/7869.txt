I was asleep in my apartment and I thought I heard noise in the next bedroom. I thought that the noise sounded like it was coming from my parent's bedroom, on the other side of my one wall. In waking life the other side of this wall is the neighbor's apartment and my parents do not live with me. I picked up my flashlight from the floor on the left side of my bed and shined it in the doorway. I was scared to see what the noise was but shined the light there to look anyway. I was shaking and very frightened. Finally, my parents entered the room. Just after they did though I realized they were a kind of apparition. They floated into my room and fell on me in the bed. Just as they did was when I realized it was an apparition of some type. It startled/scared me.
