Two men who sort of remind me of Howard are nice and like me. One is a rock star (only John Fischer, the TV weatherman) He walks up to me and kisses me. He's leaving on tour in a few moments, so I know I'm safe. He leans me into the back wall of a station wagon (we're standing outside). Then he pauses, closes the back hatch and walks us to the front of the car because we might get tempted by the bed in the back of the car. I like his kisses and regret when he has to leave. I get in my car and wave goodbye as he leaves in his car. I hand him my name and address.
