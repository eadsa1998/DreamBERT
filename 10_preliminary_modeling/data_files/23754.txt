Rikki [a visitor at the time, a friend of Paula's] gave me some large tablets, they looked like vitamins, and he said I seemed stressed out or unhealthy, so I should try these tablets.  I took about 4 or 5. The tablets were really a drug to make me lose consciousness or control over my actions.  Rikki was trying to drug me.  After I took them, we were preparing to go to sleep;  Paula, RB, Rikki and I all slept in one large room, each on our own cot, like we were camping out or in a dorm.  I said goodnight to Rikki, his cot was next to mine.  He turned to me and said, no darling, you're not going to sleep alone.  I'm coming in.  He was planning to rape me or take advantage of me, so as soon as he touched me, I screamed as loud as I could.  I was able to really scream in this dream.  By screaming several times before he hurt me, I turned him in to the cops.  He was arrested and/or jailed.  Later, RB and I were joking around.  RB said something like, "I better be careful, you might take this the wrong way and turn me in too."  I said, "No, RB, I would never do that to you or Paula.  It was just Rikki.  I knew the tablets were drugs and that he was planning to set me up to rape me.  That's why I let it go to that point.  I had to make sure he got arrested or jailed, got put away.  But you and Paula are different; I would never do that to you."  For a minute I wondered whether I had set him up, like entrapment, for a bogus charge, just because I was mad at him and sick of him.  I think I had this doubt because of RB's comment.  But then I remembered that he had really attempted to rape me, had said he would, and had started to touch me.  So I was justified in turning him in.
