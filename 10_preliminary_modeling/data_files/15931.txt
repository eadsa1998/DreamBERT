We had this hangout in like a cave? I crawled through this tunnel into the place and Stephen Merchant was there too, but he had a piercing near his mouth and it really annoyed me. He was talking to someone at one point and referred to me as 'her' and I loved the way he said it. He kissed me at some point and then later found out I hated piercings so removed them. Later, we were in class and Mr Hoover was pairing us up so we wouldn't be with our friends, but he did the newbies first and then all of us were left. Tristan was like 'I'm going with Marcos' and I said 'that's not fair, I'm going with Frederick' and Fletcher was also in class and ended up in a group of 3. We had to make a film and Frederick went off to swim in this pool and was like 'I know what kind of film we can make' and I made a face and said 'that's not PG'. I went to the train station with Frederick and Cecelia, but it was one I hadn't been to before and was confusing. I got lost trying to find the Woodside line and eventually I gave up, exhausted and called Mom to pick me up saying I couldn't work it out.
