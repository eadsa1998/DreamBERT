I was working on my online sales things, primarily my own items. I was cleaning up my old stereo, particularly around the needle and the hinge of the needle arm. I had an idea for a way to get more of the dust out without damaging anything. I also had a bunch of jewelry. Matthew was there. He offered to help so I could get some of it listed. I was thinking about things that I sold and feeling very sad that I had sold some of the things that I had. In particular, I had sold the turntable that Matthew just bought me for my birthday. I was feeling very upset about that, because at the time I wasn't even thinking about the fact that it was a gift from Matthew. He didn't know that I had sold it and I didn't want him to know. I felt so horrible for not remembering that it came from him and then selling it.
