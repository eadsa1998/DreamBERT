I was watching a movie from the 1910's. It was about a Disneyland theme park. There was a shot of a part from the 1966 remake with "Christian Bale" who I then realized was actually James Brolin. I played the 'girl'. The Dad was mean. Her bed was outside and the Dad sat at the window, inside, with a lamp on and watched her. She wrote in her diary. He got angry at one point and I locked this door thing. He stood there and pushed it open. I had studied something and was spouting information at him. He came in and I ran. My car was outside and I ran to it and got in. I locked it, but then thought I unlocked it and did it again, and he opened the door. I started the car up and put my foot down. I got 'images' of people on the streets.
