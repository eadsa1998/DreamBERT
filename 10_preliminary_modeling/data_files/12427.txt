I was digging up TV shows in front yard. This guy wanted some movies and I said I'd just give him DVD's. There was this place for movies. This guy was asking questions. I was at the shop and Ivan was there and he was calling me 'Fatty'. There weren't any taps at the shop and someone went spazzy. Quincy gave me this lunch box starter pack as a present.
