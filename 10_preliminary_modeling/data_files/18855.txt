A group of Miami type hotels and little stretches of sand. The feeling that they are near Quincey Mass. or South __________, N.J. Audrey and I seem to be moving. I'm talking to Barry Cohen and explaining to him which of two jobs she will take. Barry says straight out, "Dick, do you think that she's wanted?" I start trying to explain while I know she doesn't function very well in some setups, that it really is true that she does function well and happily in others, mentioning Mars Schwartz as someone who would verify this. I feel bad that I have to convince him and also that he doesn't appear to have an open mind on the subject.
