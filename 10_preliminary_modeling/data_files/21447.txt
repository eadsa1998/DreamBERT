I came into the house thru the side door. When I was going out again, I noticed the door was unlocked and ajar a little. I thought someone might have come into the house. So I went down to the basement and looked into the fruit bin. I noticed the door was ajar there also. So I thought some stranger was in there. I got hold of the door to shut in the person and he pushed out and I pushed the door in. I finally got the door shut. I tried to yell for help upstairs, but I couldn't yell. Then I got an object in my hand and I opened the door and looked in cautiously. I saw a little man there. He was going to resist me, so I hit him on the head with the club and he sat down. Then I found out he was a dp and had no place to shelter, so I said he could shelter here. I was replacing some bricks from a building. I went down and picked up a couple bricks, then went up and put them on the wall. I was sort of stealing them.
