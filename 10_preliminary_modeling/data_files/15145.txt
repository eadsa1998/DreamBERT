I was at Nana's in the kitchen. I was going to play Monopoly with Ezra, Nana, Dad and Poppa. Dad explained the rules to Poppa. We had a giant sized board and the dice was made of cardboard and was the size of my hand. Poppa decided the game was stupid and didn't want to play. Poppers came into the room and I went into the dining room. I went out the back and there were some kittens in the birdcages being naughty. Fido was out there too.
