I was back in Mexico at what I believe was the ranch I was visiting this summer. The people I stayed with would take no notice of me and I felt very small. I think that I then tried to get solace from the Mexicans in the bunk house but they would sort of wander away from me when I approached them. I went to the corral to take (steal) a horse, but I was apprehended by someone and woke up.
