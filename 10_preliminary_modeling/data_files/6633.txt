Sitting in dark outdoors and see O.M. pass by on way to show. A crowded lecture hall. When speaker arose and began, two large groups of the audience hurried out noisily leaving only the faculty at side platform. The speaker is a fair man, with a large nose, long curly chestnut hair and beard. We stop and we go out to see if it was a fire. Later papers have something about his southern sympathies not appealing to the crowd.
