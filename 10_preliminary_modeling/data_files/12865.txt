I was at 'school' and I had an assembly. We were in this room which had steps with seats on them. I was sitting next to Silas at the very back edge. Colin Farrell was a special guest and I was like 'What the hell?!'. He asked for a volunteer and everyone stood up except for me. They sat down again and he picked me and I shook my head and said "No!". He then said "Ok, Jenny Craig" and Julianna went down. Colin asked me if I wanted to do the next one, which was going to be good. Then I was down the front and Calvin was next to me. Sounds Like a Melody came on and I said "I love this song!". The siren went before me and I was like "Yay!". He was giving autographs and I decided to get one. I said my name was Izzy and he was like "Freya?" and I said "No, Izzy". He wanted to put a picture of Santa on there. He also didn't have an accent and looked different.
