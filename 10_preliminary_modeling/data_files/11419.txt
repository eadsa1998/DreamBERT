The dream occurred just before waking this morning and was one of a series of short dreams. This was the most complete and best-remembered however. I am at home and it is 1:30, which is the time the mail is delivered. I ran down to the mailbox and a letter from the Reserve medical school. I close my eyes, say a few magic words and proceed to open it. It isn't an acceptance, however, but a letter saying that because I've had so many doctors write recommendations for me the money ($5) I paid originally for applying didn't cover the cost of handling all the letters I had had sent. Consequently my chances of getting into medical school were much smaller than previously. The next day I saw the dean of the school, and he further elaborated what I had seen in the letter. He seemed very disgusted with me and my methods. He also said that they had little respect for fellows who tried to swamp with "too good" letters of recommendations. Here, thank god, I awoke.
