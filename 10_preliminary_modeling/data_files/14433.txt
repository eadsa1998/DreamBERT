I was in a car. We passed some train tracks and there were piles of rocks. We stopped at the lights and I helped moving the rocks (I was strong, and I can't remember why, but I was thinking I was like Superman). There were shoes too and we were chucking them in a pile. We went to this house, which was mansion like. There were two sets of stairs leading up. I went to a bedroom and I thought someone else was here, and I asked "cupboard?" I was then with Chuck and Sarah (both from Chuck). I told Chuck to run. This girl came out and attacked me. I started fighting her and was trying to protect Chuck.
