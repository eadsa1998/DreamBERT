I was having a test in historical geology. Instead of being a regular written test, the questions asked were on this order: "Draw an endoceras proteiforme of the Ordovician period." This was not a class test, but each pupil was called to the board individually to answer one question. After this question, I said, "holy Jesus I could not do that in a month of Sundays." I didn't recognize any one in this dream.
