I was on stage with lots of people. I was sitting at a small table with 3 or 4 people. The rest were on risers, facing the audience. A woman in the group turned to another woman and started picking on her verbally. I didn't like it. I stood up and placed my body between them and faced the one who was attacking. I shook her shoulders and said, "Stop it. I'm tired of this and I want you all to stop now!" Then, we all sang for the audience. I was standing in front of the group. I sang with the group. Then I had a solo. It was beautiful; 1 long, high, clear note. I got a standing ovation. I was looking at the audience wondering if it were a standing ovation, or if they were leaving because it was the end of the play. A very tall red headed man, shy, came over to me. He was naive. He wanted to kiss me. I was amused. He would bend way down. The kiss wasn't very satisfactory. He kept trying different ways. Finally, I got a little exasperated that he wasn't figuring it out fast enough, so I reached out and hopped up and wrapped my arms around him. It was a very satisfying, sexy kiss. I could feel his penis, hard and I thought, "Oh, it's small." Maybe I should stop before it goes any further.
