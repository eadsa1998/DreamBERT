I dreamed about familiar people, namely my two sisters, my mother, my father, the friends I have recently made, and a girl I am in love with. The surroundings were beaches I know, highways and towns I have gone through or seen in pictures. My sisters' ages are 15 and 16. My mother is 48, my father is 55. I remember clearly that everyone was laughing; I don't know what about, but everybody was laughing hard. I tried to ask them what about. I grabbed them, but they didn't hear me asking. I thought they were laughing at me, but it wasn't so. I knew they weren't laughing at me. All at the same time started to keep quiet. I came over to ask them, but I wasn't with them. I talked to them, I shouted for them to look at me, but it was as though I weren't there. Everyone was running in the same direction, afterwards in opposite directions and later on in any direction, but all around me. I saw one who was leaving, coming. To them I wasn't there at any point. I didn't realize when it was over.
