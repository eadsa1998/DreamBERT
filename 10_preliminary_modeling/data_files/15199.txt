I was on World of Warcraft. There was a long quest line, and each quest had an hour timer on it, but they were short. The quest reward window was different -- there were four different choices all which four different items, all of which had no value. For the second part of the quest, I had to speak to an 'Alpha Male' wolf in a cave. There were lots of them and some were yellow (non-agro) and some were red (agro). I finished with him and got an exp reward and I turned to run from an agro but he attacked me. I flew out to get to the next place. Mom was going to take me to university to drop off my chemistry assignment. It was worth 15% of my grade. She said that we would be going to a barbecue picnic afterwards and were going to bring along stuff for a steak sandwich for me. I said that I'd just go and get my assignment. The house was different. Before my room, there was a big toilet (it was probably about the size of my room in RL). It had a sliding door. My room also had a small toilet to the side. I did a pee in the big toilet and Mom came and was like 'what are you doing?' and I said I was peeing and she was like 'what?' and went to open the door and I held it shut and I repeated what I said. She was like ok and left. I had a red shirt on. I grabbed my grey jacket which was on my bed, my chemistry stuff and my water bottle. I was still logged on to World of Warcraft and it said that I had tried to trade with heaps of people. I then realized I only had 4.9k gold and it said that 600k had been traded to someone called 'thinking[something I don't remember]baby' and I told him to give me my money back and he ran off and I used an angry emote. I asked Ezra why he took money from me and he said it wasn't him.
