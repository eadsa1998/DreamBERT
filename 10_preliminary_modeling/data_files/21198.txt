I was out in the country on a farm. I came to a small cherry tree and there were some black ripe cherries on the tree. I picked them. My sisters pulled down the branch roughly and I yelled at them to let it go, so they wouldn't break it. I looked into a tree and I saw a snake's head, a large one, and a big branch. I told everyone to go away and stay away. I would go into the house for my rifle. I came in and got some shells and brother Steve started to go where the snake was. I yelled at him, but he wouldn't heed me. I got angry at him and bawled him out. Someone knocked down what I thought was the snake and it was a piece of steel. I looked up at the sky and a bird was flying over. I pointed the rifle at him, but didn't shoot. On top of the barn were three different kind of lights from years back. I looked towards the city of Big City and way out in the distance I could see a cloud of smoke where the city was. I was in Akron at the races, but I don't remember any of the horses or winners. I was by Rudis and we got on a streetcar, rather Audrey, and I asked the conductor if it went to a certain place and he said no. I told him to tell Audrey to get off. He started out and made one stop that I could see and Audrey didn't get off. I was excited. I asked Rudis to go with me to catch the streetcar to get Audrey. And she said it would be two hours before the car would reach the end of the line. I heard two Johnnies won.
