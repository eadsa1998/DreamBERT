 I'm with my friend Ellen Sanders. We're upstairs in a house. It seems she has just moved in, and her room is in the basement. She tells me there is a light on in the basement that shouldn't be on. It is as if she shut it off and now it's back on. I get the feeling that someone or something may be responsible for the light being on. I go downstairs to check this out. I'm a bit afraid, like someone may be hiding there. I turn on all the lights in her room, which seems to be the basement bedroom at the Whitman house. There is a washer and dryer in her room. I walk out into the rest of the basement, which seems like the basement at home in Oak Valley. There is a washer and dryer where the old laundry chute would empty out. I look at that washer and dryer for a bit, and then notice that to my left, standing there, is Ted Matson, my high school classmate. He's standing very still, like he doesn't want me to see him. His head is between two boards in the ceiling. Other people come down the stairs. One of them is a man, and he says to Ted, "You're gay." Two people have a huge bag of red, blue, and silver Hershey Kisses. The blue kisses are icy cool, and some have nuts. Others have smaller kisses in them. Others and I eat some. I say to Ellen, as an explanation for the light, that maybe the noise of the washer in her room overpowered the noise of the other dryer out where the laundry chute used to be. My high school classmate Lori Stanoff may be there. She and Ted seem to sit behind me on a washing machine, which is part of a third washer and dryer set, located where the real washer and dryer are in the basement.
