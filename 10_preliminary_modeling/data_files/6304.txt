My fourth dream was I called up my friend to go out but before I went to bed I was drinking. Unfortunately for me to get home that night my friend had to drive me home drunk. So that night I had a dream that my friend and I were driving around this [illegible] and he skidded out but nothing happened to our car. Six to eight cars behind us flipped over and got on fire. It reminded me of a scene I saw in the movie,  "The Good Sow." I got out of my friend's car and walked away and didn't get caught.
