["Giraffes in the new house"]  I am looking over a series of rooms I am thinking of moving into. The rooms are run down and as I go from one room to another, I notice they aren't closed off from the rest of the building. I walk from one room into another not realizing I had entered someone else's room. I back out, embarrassed. I choose one room to be Charla's bedroom. Now Robert Downing is there. He is my son. He wants to move in with us. I am hesitant. He's an addictive personality and trouble, but he is my son. We enter another room and I see a glass display case with jewelry in it. I am pleased to find something the previous owners left. I don't particularly like the jewelry itself. I comment they will make good Christmas gifts for friends. I see a pile of wooden carved giraffes. I am very happy. I say oh good, these are my totem animals. This is a good  omen. We walk down another hall to reexamine Charla's room. It is big but the hall from it simply opens out into the building. I don't like that. Now Robert and I walk outside the building to return to the first room. Each room is in a different building, it seems.
