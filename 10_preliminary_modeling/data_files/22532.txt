In my first dream I was in a place like San Isidro, that is, a residential area. I was in a house that was a dream, all comfort and luxury. At that moment I felt the happiest woman. Suddenly I was in front of a telephone and a maid was telling me that the place in which I was going to work in the house had a grey telephone which was an original model. That is, I was like a secretary in that house and attended everything pertaining to the business of the owner of the house. I felt very satisfied to have things that made me feel well and comfortable.
