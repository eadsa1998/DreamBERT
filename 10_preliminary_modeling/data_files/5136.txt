I give back the car keys to my boyfriend, who isn't treating me well. He's like Ted Danson on Cheers, a womanizer. I feel some regret because now I don't have a car and will have to figure out how to get around on my own. Now his other girlfriend needs to tell him goodbye and I am encouraging her to have the courage. She struggles and hesitates. I whisper, "Come on girl, come on. You can do it." Finally she does. She tells him it's over. Now I have to lead some group in a discussion of feelings. Two men have trouble. One is trying to share his feelings and another man is belligerent and noisy and interrupts him and they get into a verbal fight. Finally I say, "That's enough, you, leave." The man defies me and then finally leaves. Then they all leave. Now I am left with cleaning up and shutting the place up myself and I hadn't done that before. I don't know how to turn down the damper on the stove to get the fire to go out and be safe. I feel overwhelmed and frustrated and a bit of a failure for not managing to keep the group together. [BL]
