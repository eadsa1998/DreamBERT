At one point I was trying to wheedle an extra late night from my house mother. I followed her all over the dorm saying, "Please, just one late night." I don't remember whether I got one or not. Somehow I was squeezing black heads and pimples on my face. I worked on them furiously and I remember seeing the tuff squeeze out. Somehow, they weren't on me, they were on someone else's arm. They got a dark purple color, so I took a big, wet alcohol-soaked piece of cotton and dabbed them with it.
