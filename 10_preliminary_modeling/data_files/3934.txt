["Clothes and relatives."]  My mother and her sisters are trying on old clothes from each other. My mother shows me one pretty outfit. I put it on. I go into a small cubicle room, like a walk in closet and look at the clothes. Aunt Naomi and my mother are talking amiably. I see some crackers shaped like teddy bears (crisp bread, really) and some blonde colored sliced meat. A note from Aunt Bridget says help yourself. I look at the meat, but it looks unappetizing and I don't know how long it's been out, unrefrigerated. So I nibble on a cracker and like the taste.
