I see Aunt Bridget, who tells me she has cancer. Then she runs for the ladies' room and throws up (from chemo). I realize she's mostly naked and I take her clothes so that at least she won't be embarrassed. There is throw-up all over the floor. I carefully walk through it, trying not to step in any. I feel empathy for Bridget and disgust at the throw-up.
