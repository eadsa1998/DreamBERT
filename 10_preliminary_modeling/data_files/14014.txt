I was at school. I was in the library, which was different. I had an accounting test next. When I went out, my bag wasn't there. I told Ms Solomon and she let me search for it. We then had an assembly in a weird room. There were steps for us to sit on, but people were sitting under them as well. I was drawing a picture of a car in pencil. When I rubbed some of it out, the lights on the car broke and it also made this sheet of glass break. A teacher found it and I said I'd accidentally hit it and they thought I'd chucked a sad and broke it on purpose. Someone was on their phone and found my Bluetooth, and so I followed the signal from my phone and found my bag. My Bluetooth was called '2018'. There were some elevators and I was with Mom. Daydream Believer and Don't Fear the Reaper were playing. Darius had his bed in the common room. Margarita was around and was talking to someone. I was driving down the street with Dad. We saw Jayson, Jonas and others standing on the side of the road with these big white suits on, which looked like astronaut suits, so I asked "What's with the astronaut suits?". Dad said they were limo drivers. I saw Eugene there and wondered why he had decided to become a limo driver.
