["Too Many Characters In My Play"]  I am outside, sitting at a street corner. I want a good seat so I can see my play. The other authors of the other plays to be presented are sitting behind me. Suddenly I realize that I can't see or hear the play from this corner because we are several blocks away from the presentation. I get up and walk rapidly toward the outdoor theatre. The other authors follow me. I am nearly running when I wonder if I can manage this. I am out of breath. I finally arrive only to see the play is finished. I hear the applause which sounds warm and loud. I ask a man seated on my right if it is only intermission, or is it the end. He said it was the end. I am disappointed. I ask him what he thought of the play. He said there were too many characters. 14 of them. He couldn't keep track of them all and the plot was too involved and he got confused. I don't feel good about his negative critique. I must be a poor writer.
