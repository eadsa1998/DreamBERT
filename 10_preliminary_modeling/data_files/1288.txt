I'm in some group session, a facilitator. A woman rushes over to Eric and jumps on him. She wants to be affectionate and possibly sexual with him. Because he's blind, it startles him a great deal. He's scared. He throws himself face forward on the ground to protect himself. She is upset and angry because all she's got to contact is his back. She goes away. Eric sits up. There are tears in his eyes. He needs my support. He reaches over and envelopes me in a hug. The woman is crying too. She feels rejected. She's trying to pull Eric off me so she can be hugged by me. I tell her to wait. I say, "I know you feel badly and I want to help, but you have to understand. Eric's blind. You scared him. He needs me more." [BL]
