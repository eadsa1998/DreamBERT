[1997-06-28] Betsy is a lovely lady that I serve on committees with and I think a lot of her, I have known her for 50 years almost. Betsy and I were on the grounds of our childhood school for the blind, I think. Our purpose for being there was that there was a meeting with a good sized committee that she and I would both be attending. But I also had the strong feeling that I wanted to talk to Betsy about other than political issues and it was one of those times when you knew you were going to be talking well into the night, like when you get together with an old friend and there's lots of catching up to do.
