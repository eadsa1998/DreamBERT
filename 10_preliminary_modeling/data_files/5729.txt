[1997-05-12] I tried to check the time on my talking clock (and, by the way I have had this dream numerous times over the past few years) but the clock malfunctioned, either the battery was going dead or something, and when I pressed the button for the time it started to say a bunch of things about the computer keyboard, and it was just not acting the way it should at all. I knew there was something wrong with it and I was afraid I had slept in and missed my wake-up time for work.
