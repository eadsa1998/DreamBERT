["Howard's back."] Bonnie and I are in a room. A man is transplanting plant starts into a number of interesting pottery pieces. He wants my approval and attention. I sort of ignore him. There was a nap and then Howard comes in. I need to go to a workshop. Howard picks me up and carries me down the raked stairs. He places me in the audience. One person is lying down with a sheet over them. I lie down too. Later it is time to leave and the other man does everything he can to get my attention. I choose to ignore him again. Time is passing. We are late leaving I gather up some of the plants in their containers. There are several small children running around, having fun. Howard's arms are strong and we laugh at some joke together.
