["Back at work"]  I am back at work in the counseling department. Mabel hands me a small cup of water and tells me to take it to Jason for his son. I am walking through the halls looking for the room. I walk a long way and feel very tired. I decide to take a short cut. I go to a wall that has a small broken hole in it. Several disabled people are seated nearby. They are sitting quietly, resigned. I see the hole is too small for me and particularly for my purse. I am very frustrated because this means I will have to walk the long way around. I say out loud, I hate being disabled. I feel bad then because of the other disabled people there. I continue walking. I am now walking down a long hall in the basement floor. I see my co-worker Jerry walking with a bad limp. He hurries past me. Then he comes back and walks with me to help me find my way. I finally arrive at a long table where the counselors are seated in a row. I walk to Jason's place and hand him the cup of water, which is now partly empty because some spilled. Now I look up to the ceiling and see a grate. Through the grate I see a group of the counselors seated in their lounge area. Hank is talking. He is looking down where I am and commenting that he didn't realize that the two rooms could see and hear each other. He is surprised. The counselors used to have this room. And the students were in the above room.
