Scene laid in my hometown. On a previous visit to Hardys I thoughtfully left certain articles of clothing, including my coat, and go back to get them. On entering their backyard I remember that Mleanie is now in the house and I hesitate to knock on the door, partly because of a reluctance to disturb them, and partly because I feel my presence would be unwelcome. So I wander about, thinking that, in case any of the Hardys come out and ask me why I didn't walk in, I can explain that I was on my way to the pond nearby, which I wished to examine, and merely passed through the yard as a short cut to the pond. By this time I find myself in the front yard, and notice a couple of short clothes lines, with drying clothes, on the front porch. A lady, probably Grace Hardy (though I do not see her face distinctly), is watering potted plants on the same porch with the clothes lines. she wears a neat brownish, polkadot housedress. she glances at me, without speaking, though I clearly sense that her attitude toward me is a friendly one. The front walk is very different from what it was formerly, being closer to the house and also now having 2 curved branches, one from the north, the other from the south, which merge into the walk leading up to the house. There is a similar arrangement leading to the curb.
