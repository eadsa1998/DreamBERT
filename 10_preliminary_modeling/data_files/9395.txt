We go exploring the "gold coast" that the US has acquired along the ocean front. I go into the water and swim upstream but it is too difficult. Ride in a boat with interesting men. Then on the way back I swim down stream with the current. easy, wonderful feeling! Later see the mountains covered with snow with the sun shining on them. Also see Half Dome and other mountains from Yosemite.
