Frank and Jonathan are sitting in the front room: Frank is correcting blue books and they talk animatedly together, but he does not talk to me... ignores me, so I blow up and get terribly angry at him: "I am mad," I say, but they are silent; then they laugh about me as I go out of the room, but I eavesdrop behind the door: I see that they are laughing; I am on my hands and knees as I awaken.
