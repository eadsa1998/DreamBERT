I was very happy because I was going to have a date with a man. Just as we started out of the house, I found I had forgotten something and had to go back upstairs for it. I hurried down again but he had gone outside. I went out on the sidewalk to look for him. It was rather dark outside. I went to a crowd in one direction and then in another. I called mother but there was no answer. Al last I knew they had all gone off in a car and forgotten me. So I went back in the hotel. Thought I might call the place we were going to and have someone return for me. Perhaps they would come back but maybe they thought I could come out on the bus. (Attempts to phone and conversation with hotel porter mostly forgotten.)
