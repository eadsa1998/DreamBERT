At Church: under different circumstances, see two women I do not know. I hear one say, "Oh, I saw this last nite...or something like that." Then I see them go into a trance. E.S.P. Amazing to me, but others don't seem too surprised. Connie Ellis (now in my Church Prayer Group) asks about my clothes; different? "Yes and no, I just don't know how to dress. You can help me." "OK I will," says Connie Ellis. View of a cloister on a wall of a monastery with a Christmas creche scene.
