I dreamt that it was summer again and I was down at the beach at Lake Erie. I was all alone until a girl whom I judged to be about 17 came up to me and began to talk. She was very friendly and I decided I liked her. She told me she was from Pittsburgh and that she didn't know anyone at the resort. She and her parents and brother had just bought a cottage and this was their first summer at the resort. She asked me to come to her cottage that evening and meet her family, which I did. Her parents were very nice and just as friendly as she. Her brother turned out to be a very nice-looking blond fellow about 22 who was a senior in college. It was a very pleasant evening and I was asked to come back. The beginning of an exciting summer.
