Corinne is swimming and sees a boat, a row boat under the water. She points at it and dives to bring it up. I get worried. She's down too long. I yell at Uncle Lionel, "Can I borrow your row boat with a motor?" I get in and Dwight and Lydia come with me. We help get it up and put it (small and crumpled) into Lionel's boat. Lydia sees two prettily painted red oars. We go back to shore and discover we're wearing old-fashioned swim suits. We've gone back in time! Lydia is jabbering and bragging about it and I give her a long intense lecture about keeping her mouth shut. "I don't want anyone to know, so we can get back to our own time!"
