I was at my alma mater, or the university area of the city.  I went into the darkened back door of some building, from an alley.  Inside the building it was also dark, and every time I went through a door, I was confronted with a choice of several more doors.  I'm not sure who or what I was looking for.  At one point I saw some nurses and they gave me further directions.  One of them was rather attractive, and looked sort of like Sister Frances Aid at the university where I work.  Later I was lounging on the grass with her, like between the library and the science building at my alma mater.  There was a very warm and affectionate relationship between us.  It was noon, and I remembered I had promised some little old lady to meet her for lunch at a nearby cafeteria, off campus.  I really hated to leave our spot there, but the girl understood and came along with me as if by prior arrangement.  She and the older lady knew each other; I think they worked at the same place.  At the cafeteria, we had to go down an escalator.  Just as I got on it, I saw Joan Morris on the floor we were just leaving.  I called to her, and she seemed pleased to see me.  I asked her if it was true that she had gotten married.  She said it was, and I congratulated her and asked her what her new name was.  She said it was Linda Canyada.  I thought it was odd that she had changed her first name too.  There was a freshman football player named Jerry Canyada in my dorm section my senior year, and I wondered if that was whom she had married.  We were right on time to meet the little old lady.  Later on, I was back at the original house with all the doors, trying to remember the way I had made it through before.
