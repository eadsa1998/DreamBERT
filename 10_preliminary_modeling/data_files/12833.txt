Ezra, Mom and I ended up stuck on this island. I was in 'work' clothes. We were staying with this guy who was my age. He got this report card and gave me something that was mine. I gave something to him instead of his mother. He put the report somewhere and pulled out another which had A's and B's. He was in the same year as me. There was this 'town boogeyman'. He had vines in his yard that would swing down. People were lying on the floor and we had to wait for hours to be let out of this cage thing. Some people got trapped in a section of the yard which was surrounded with chicken wire. He got our laptops. They were outside his house. Ezra ran off and I was about to, but I went to the door and asked for him. He got a gun and I thanked him.
