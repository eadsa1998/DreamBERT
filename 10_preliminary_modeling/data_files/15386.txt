There was a FilmForum get together and I walked there. A lady with a dog and a weird accent talked to me. Leif was on the other side of the road. I got there and had a deep cut on my arm -- it started about halfway down and was about 10cm long. A girl asked if I'd seen this new porno and I said I hadn't. I played some game that was an hour long and was going to play it again. There was a little carpark and you had to stand in front of a parking space and place a light and then park the car. George Clooney had a 'fold up' car. I was watching Friends and Chandler was the one who liked to cook.
