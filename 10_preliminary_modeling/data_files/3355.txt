I am in a house and there are lots of people there, a party. They are having a great time. I am on the phone talking to Archie I am trying to think of things to say to keep him talking to me. He is annoyed, in fact, angry at me. He says, angrily, "You are better than this, trying to manipulate it so we are alone. I don't like it when you do that. You know better than that." He hangs up on me. I feel terribly hurt and rejected, numbed by the pain of it. I turn and people are cheerfully calling out to me to join the party. I try to respond to them but it is very difficult. I go out to the back yard and something about Charla only having her diapers on. I see her and see she has an outfit of clothes on and looks fine. I comment that she is fine, perfectly and properly clothed. Her "mom" and "dad" want to stay at the party and I want to leave, to be alone. I tell them they can stay as long as they want. The "dad" says, "But she only has one diaper. We'll only be able to stay as long as it lasts." I shrug; not my problem. I try to leave. I feel weighted down with the sadness of Archie's rejection.
