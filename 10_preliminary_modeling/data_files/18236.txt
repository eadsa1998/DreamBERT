I was in a large 12-story building and I was on the first floor and this was a rather unusual building because when you were on the first floor you were supposed to help children who were there learn how to play with these certain toys and certain puzzles and you didn't know exactly what you were supposed to do besides help them. But if you did a certain thing and it was the right thing, then a door on the wall across from where you would be, rather a doorway, it was just an opening, would turn a strange shade. It would start glowing this reddish, brownish color, and you would go over to it then and you would be able to go thru it and you would be on the next level of the building. But if you went over to the doorway when it wasn't in this shape you would just be somewhere else on the 1st level but you wouldn't go up to the next one. The idea was that on each floor you were supposed to help children with some toy or something that was a little bit more difficult than on the level before that I did this and finally reached the top level, the 12th level. And this was supposed to be a spiritual ascent so that when I reached the 12th level I had this tremendous feeling of love for everybody that was around me and everybody that existed. Here I was trying to help a child, I and another person who had reached that level also, a little boy who wasn't really supposed to be on this level at all so we had to go back down to the 1st level to get some toys and things to help him with.
