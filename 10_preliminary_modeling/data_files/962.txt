I am in Germany at a bus depot. I am trying to find out if I can get on a bus with my wheelchair. I know a few words in German "Was ist das?" etc. Didn't look too promising. Everyone is concerned because things weren't accessible. Then I'm in my green pickup. I think Howard, or another woman (myself), is with me. I suggest we get on a subway car and we talk about leaving the chair in the pickup. We're standing out on a sidewalk discussing ways and means. I notice we're standing in front of a hospital. I suggest we go in there, in case I start going into labor. We go in. The person with me is all excited and wants to check me right in. I get embarrassed and squat down beside him or her. I whisper, "Please don't. I've been thinking, I'm not even sure I'm pregnant." I look at my tummy and realize I'm not, and it would be embarrassing to get checked in for labor and I'm not even pregnant. My friend then goes in to talk to a doctor. Now I'm really embarrassed. She comes back and says, "The doctor wants to talk to you." Now I'm a little angry too. I decide to leave. I then see Andrea. I start to pat her on the arm and remember not to. I say, "Imagine seeing you here in a hospital in Germany." She looks at me like she doesn't know me and starts talking about where she might have met me. I just smile at her little joke, not completely sure it's a joke.
