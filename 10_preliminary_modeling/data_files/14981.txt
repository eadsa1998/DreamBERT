I was picking up something from Calvin on the side of the road. I was driving with Mom. We were waiting for this bus and we went to stop but then the bus came so we had to go. There were people on the road including Bradley. I said that people from school were always in the way. Later there was something that looked like it had a plane going through the wall and I joked with Ezra about it.
