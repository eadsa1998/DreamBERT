My baby goes into my Grandma Mildred's bedroom and wakes her up, only it's Grandma Agnes. I go in after her, shushing her and taking her out. I see in the kitchen that Grandma has started a pancake breakfast. I try to flip the pancakes so they'll cook, but it's messy. Then Sonja comes in and I walk out with her. We are in the back seat of a car. She is very caring. and hugs me. I return the hug and tell her thanks for the books she sent. I particularly liked the Beverly Cleary one. Sonja smiles and says, "But what about the other one? It's more important." I say, "It was interesting trying to weasel out of having to say I haven't read it because it's a Christian book." I get out of a car and start hitchhiking. A street cleaner (huge vehicle) yellow, stops. The woman driver looks at me and I say, "I'm going the other way for a few blocks. Is it OK?" She says, "Sure," and turns the machine around. Then she hops out and pours coffee in pretty china cups for the male crew. I think about her dual role of independent career woman and then being the server of coffee for men. Then the vehicle becomes five wheelchairs all hooked together in a row. We take off.
