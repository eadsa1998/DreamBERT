I saw the electric wire near the light socket smoke. I turned off the switch, but the light or power didn't go off and it smoked more and it started to burn. Fire came out of the socket. I was going to call the fire department. The bed was dirty. I was cleaning it off. I looked at a piece of pipe which was insulated. Frank Zup and I were looking at the results and a steel or metal horse won. I forgot the name.
