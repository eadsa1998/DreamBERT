I'm in a mobile office waiting for my team to come in. They do. They are great big, tough soccer players. Noisy. One is complaining because he hates the Strong Campbell Interest inventory and wants to sue somebody so he doesn't have to do it. Then another guy falls out of a bunk bed and bangs his head and drags out a box full of stuff. The first guy grabs something from the box and says, "Hey! That's mine," and they start arguing and pushing. I stand up and yell at them to stop. He stands up very tall over me and snarls, "Oh yeah?" I gather up all my strength and yell, "You'd better sit down and right now!" He just melts like a scared pup into the chair. I walk away feeling some pride at winning. I explain that he'll sue whomever he wants and he'll still take the test if everyone else has to. I go outside and see I'm on a boat and some papers are sliding off into the water form the movement of the boat and the wind. I feel some concern.
