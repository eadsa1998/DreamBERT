I'm talking to Dr. Pf and he is saying something so I simply don't understand. I am talking to another man who is wearing a white lab coat. He is slightly taller than I am, small bit old, brown hair, wearing thin round dark-rimmed glasses, and has a very short neatly trimmed beard. He has a clipboard and on it there's a piece of paper that has a large grid that covers the entire sheet. There are perhaps 20 blocks to the grid, for a cross and five down. Most of the squares on the grid have numbers in them. Others have nothing in them. So he's talking to me and as he's talking he is using a pen to point to these various blocks on this grid as he talks. There are a couple that have numbers and a couple that have nothing but as he's talking he circles them several times very dramatically as he speaks. I stopped him and asked him what he means.
