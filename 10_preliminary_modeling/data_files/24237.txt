It's a man-made labyrinth of windowless, doorless passages, the walls covered with a cushy material, like the padded carpet inside a cubicle. I run fast, barely able to see in the dark. I realize that this place is my new place of residence. I'm interning here. On this planet, people have been forced deep underground. It's safe, but endlessly dreary. I shudder at the thought of spending eternity wandering these halls, that seem to warp as I run. I don't know my way. I wonder, will I ever get used to this place, be able to pick out one gray, faceless turn after the other? I eventually come out into a chamber, where two short people are. They are stiff and talk in script like video game characters. They explain to me why their height is so small. I say, "Why am I so tall?" They are benevolent. The bald one in a dark suit was my boss, but also nice. I look out the "window", into a lighted cavern outside and a giant green toy story alien appeared. It reached in and was benevolent. I wondered, why does my university alma mater have a partnership with Disney so these characters wander around during games? Probably because the university is in a strange state. No other place has this. Visitors ought to be impressed. Next I was in a gameworks type place, but with a high tech laser tag game. I had an empty pistol holster and an automatic weapon, an smg with a large digital IR scope. I can turn it to see around corners. It was modified to shoot the special beams. This was like paintball -- bring your own gun. I was scanned at the door when I went in by a skinny, long-haired bouncer type.. It was like being welcomed to an exclusive club. For $10 I also got 100 tickets to buy gun upgrades and the like.
