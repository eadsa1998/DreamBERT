I'm at a drive-in movie theater, big place, huge screen. We're all out of the car, visiting or doing something else - the movie isn't running anyway. It's been raining. There's a movie actor here, over at the office or whatever that is in the middle, down near the screen, he's doing a personal appearance. He seems to be a real nice guy, I'd like to get to know him. I'm wondering if I can. There's a dog here, too (I don't know if he's mine or not, black, biggish, nice dog, and he's got to come home with us, after having been somewhere for something. And he's gotten rained on. I'm worried it'll rain again and he'll get even wetter and then we'll have to drive back with him all a mess in the car. I get in the car for a minute, then coming back out I encounter a stinging insect which I'm not too pleased about. I wonder if I just got stung myself (I don't feel any pain on my skin), and if he'll be back to plague us on the way home. Actually the car's not in a good position, too close to another one, and I want to move it. So I push it. Somebody thinks I can't do it by myself, in the mud and all with other cars to run into, but it's really very easy. Just push, it goes, I turn the wheel, pull the handbrake to stop it. I got it maneuvered back into position very easily.
