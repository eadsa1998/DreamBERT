Olivia Green, (Edward's present wife), is really married to Frank; we visit and Marita is there, but none of my other children. They live at a resort place far away and they have it fixed up their way; I see Olivia feed Frank out of a small bottle: a small red, hot water bottle, and sitting on the chair and tickling his chin, "You like that don't you?" I was appalled and jealous. Olivia and Frank entertained the villagers, Frank was wearing an apron and waiting on people and dancing "Schuhplattler polka!" Olivia was inside, supervising the kitchen help and serving guests as well. I feel very lost and jealous: "how come she is married to Frank?" I wonder; I am bewildered and hurt. How can I get him back? After waking from the dream we are back in our own house and Frank is my husband again; Olivia has left. We are building bookshelves? and I am carrying up 2x4's and calling on the phone; whom am I calling? Happy-- awaken
