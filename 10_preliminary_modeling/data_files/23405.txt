I was playing out the movie "Scream." The two people who where the killers in the movie were the same as in the dream. The whole dream was the two killers chasing me trying to kill me. Don't really remember the sequence of things. At one point in the beginning, I had sex with one of the guys even though I knew he wanted to kill me. Another time, they were coming up some stairs and I hit them on the head with a pan and knocked them unconscious, then grabbed their gun. I think it was later that I tried to shoot them, but it wasn't working. It may not have been loaded. I ended up in a tavern and told the people in there what was happening. They just stayed calm like they were before. They let me stay there with them until it closed at 2:00 am. I took to an older man, I felt really safe with him. After the tavern scene, I was somewhere with him and he was hiding me.
