["Sue the bastards."] Now I am in a house and want to return to the place where I bought the machine to do my dreams with. It isn't working. I get my power wheelchair but it is malfunctioning also. It wont atop when I let go of the joystick. Dwight is there. He's not very helpful. I need to step up a stair and he does help me balance. I get in the chair. I decide I need to pee. I find a bathroom with four stalls and go to the end one. I open the door. No toilet. I move my chair out of the way and open the next one. Then a woman comes out of the end stall. I hadn't seen her in there. I apologize to her. Now we go back to the store. The bored woman says too bad the machine is broken. It is really another store that made them and they don't give money back. I should just sue them right away. Lots of luck. I question her more I say well, didn't you sell this to me knowing they won't fix it unless I sue? Then I can sue you. I am assertive and right. She is unhappy.
