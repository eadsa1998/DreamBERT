 I'm moving in a vehicle of some sort with another person. We are going past a wooded area. I tell the person to go slower, to look for moose. At the end of the forest we see the backside of a moose! We slow and stop, looking at it. The moose backs out of the brush, and we see it has a calf climbing on it, like a young monkey climbs on its mother. The calf is about _ the size of the cow. I tell the other person to keep our distance from them, because of the calf. We move away, down the road.
