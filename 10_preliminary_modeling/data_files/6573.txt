In large house of many rooms. Trying to arrange for entire family in it. Details of house clear but furniture scanty. Try to give poison, a reddish powder to doll. L. wanted some. Let her take it and also another child. Mother comes in and complains of my share. L. gets scared and is persuaded to send for doctor. He takes out rubber bag with sharp instruments at one end and punches her in chest. Her cries fairly distinct.
