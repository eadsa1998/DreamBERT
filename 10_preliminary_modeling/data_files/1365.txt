I'm in the chair. I drive it over a big desk and run it over the edge. I lightly land. Someone is astonished at that. I drive away. I see my cousin Abner; he's in church. I drive up next to his desk. The minister comes up and reaches under my dress and fondles my breast. I can't believe it's really happening because we are in full view of the church members. He talks his sermon as if nothing has happened. I just stare up at him surprised. Abner sneaks a note to me. It has Pete's address on it. 509. I ask what that means. Someone says it means "my fair lady." Later, Tyler talks to me about an adventure he had and how he told my stories. He has a piece of my Mexico dress around his neck. I receive a gift, a 3-D picture from the guys from Mexico. It starts transforming into a ferocious robot, but I have to hold it up because the legs were weak. Then it transformed back. CCC/D wrote the "picture."
