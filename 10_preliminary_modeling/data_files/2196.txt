Someone returns my jewels, but I see they are clever forgeries. I go to call a policeman friend to meet me for lunch to share my concerns. He doesn't show up and next I am buried up to my neck in the sand. I slowly wriggle myself free and crawl away, watching the wind blow the sand to cover my tracks as I go to hide.
