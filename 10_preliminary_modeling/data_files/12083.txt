It was National Cleanup day. It was recess and it was Monday. Calvin left his bag in class and left. I sat on the floor and leaned back on a chair and fell. I accidentally had brought my diary to school. Fang left. Evelyn asked me if I thought anyone in the class was "cute" or "super cute". I said no, and she said her and Fang did. Fang came back in for a second. Outside, these animals were loose. We were on a track. This polar bear got me and some dude shot it.
