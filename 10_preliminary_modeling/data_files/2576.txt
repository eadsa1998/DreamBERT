I'm looking for my pills. Ricardo and Rigo are standing in my daily pill boxes. I move pills from Rigo. He's too young and might take some. I have trouble distinguishing between the pink ones and the peach-colored ones. Howard comes to bed, Ernie like, wearing black bikini briefs like Kevin Kline who reminds me of Barry S. Ginny is around. I'm pregnant. I lay down on a hospital bed. A doctor puts his hand on my belly. No pain yet, but there will be soon. The doctor might have a gay lover. There's a pair of shoes on the floor. I see an open door to another hospital room and hear a little girl crying out, "Daddy, daddy, there were these lights." She'd been dreaming and was afraid, running down the hall to her daddy's room. I thought to myself, "Listen to her, you jerk. She needs to know she's OK." He doesn't. He says, "Yeah, yeah," like she's making up a story. I feel sad for her. I see a creature that opens his mouth and moves his tongue out to greet me. It lives in a bowl. It looks like a shrimp thing (and like Audry II in Little Shop of Horrors) I ask, "Can't it get out?" concerned because it needs water and I don't see very much and if it gets out, it could dry up. He likes me and recognizes me when I am near. I bring him a present: a box of Kleenexes, a purse-size one in a plastic wrap. He loves it and comes out and eats some. Then Ginny opens its mouth and pulls out a string of white stuff and puts it on the table. It wiggles around. The creature says, Where is it?" Ginny says, "Over there." It says, "It has changed form (meaning been born)." I see it looks like a tiny white elephant. It's a baby. Everyone wants to help me and I then realize, "Oh, right, I forgot. When you last saw me, I was in a wheelchair and pregnant." I'm walking fine now.
