In one part of the dream I was on a bus, and I kept switching buses and moving to a new bus. It was in the city, but it felt more like the big city where I used to live rather than the city I now live in. In another part of the dream I was instructing someone on how to use an electronic towel. It was important to go over the details carefully so the person wouldn't get electrocuted.
