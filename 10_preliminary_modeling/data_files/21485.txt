I was in the old screw dept. in the flats. I was going to the locker room. The lights were dim. It was night. As I got near the locker room, it dawned on me that it was vacant of lockers. All there was, the two-sheet metal walls. As I came to the doorway entrance, I just looked in and it was dark. I started back to my machines and I heard a bugle blowing and I awoke and I heard that on our TV. I was in Rivertown. I walked thru a field familiar to my boyhood days. I walked past a couple boys with a dog. When the dog saw me, he came at me barking. I kept an eye on him and I talked to him that I wouldn't hit him. He walked along and all at once I got an urge to hit him, which I did. After that I was remorseful. I apologized and said he should not worry. I wouldn't do it again. I walked along with a paper under my arm. I was thinking that I could have been a big league baseball star. If I was young again, I would be a real star. I would work like a beaver to attain my goal. I just heard a fellow say that X was his. I can't remember what we were discussing. The fellow said, "Give me X."
