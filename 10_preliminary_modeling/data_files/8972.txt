I was at the CAS office. I noticed that they had done alot of rearranging of the two storage closets, although they didn't look like they did in waking life. The one closet had a glass window in one side of it. The closet light was on and I could see inside, which is how I noticed the change. The closet was 3 or 4 times longer than it was wide. Along the end furthest from me, one of the narrower sections, there were shelves three shelves, spaced evenly up the wall. The only thing on the shelves were several different kinds of disposable diapers for babies. I realized that they were left from when Kara C was a baby. At first I was surprised that there were so many different kinds but then realized that they had probably tried different brands until the decided on the one that they liked best. Kara C is probably a teenager now, or close to it. I wondered why they don't just get rid of them. There would certainly be plenty of charities that could make very good use of them. But I realized that would certainly be uncharacteristic of them.
