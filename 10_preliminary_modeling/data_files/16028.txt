I was out the back and the back fence was so slow we could see the neighbour. We were making jokes about something and I made a joke with a black accent saying 'I'm a strong independent woman' and the neighbour, who was a black lady, started having a go at us for being racist. I yelled back saying I could've been doing a New York gangster accent and no-one would consider that racist.
