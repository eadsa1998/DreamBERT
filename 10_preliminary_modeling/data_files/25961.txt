 I'm at home with my mom and my sister Ramona. Mark Landy calls on the phone. I had previously written him a letter trying to sell him the boat. He is calling to find out how much the boat is worth. In the letter I said between $600-$1500. I am thinking about $600 now. I don't know how much my dad paid for the boat. I may be grossly underestimating its value. Mark starts reading the letter that I wrote him to me, in an attempt to get me to sell him the boat for less than its worth. I interrupt him and tell him I know what I wrote and that I need to make a call and then I'll call him back and tell him how much I'm going to need to charge for the boat. He is quiet, and hangs up. I need to call my dad to ask him how much he paid for the boat.
