The yardman burst into the room where we were dressing. He wanted something but couldn't name the article properly. With the aid of his gestures, we learned he wanted a dishcloth. We told him he'd have to ask Miss W. for it. Looking over my clothes, I found a panty girdle I had forgotten I had. We went to the dining room. I caught on another resident's green net dress. It didn't seem to be torn but I told her of how torn my green lace had been before it was noticeable. Then I put some things in a chest but left out one article. Asked why, I said it was not mine. I'd leave it out for the owner to find. Then I asked Mrs. St. if she had stayed until the promised carolers arrived.
