I've been trying to go to sleep in here since about 4 o'clock, and I wasn't being too successful. My dream started in this room here, and I dreamt that I just couldn't get to sleep. Finally I just gave up, called Roger in and said, "It's just not going to work. I'm just not going to go to sleep." Roger had been waiting for me all night on the machine. He was rather happy to quit too. The scene then shifts to the kitchen. The kitchen is my grandmother's kitchen, and Roger was cooking. I got a cup of coffee and then came over and talked to him, explaining why I couldn't seem to get to sleep. I told him I couldn't sleep because I was trying to go to sleep and that never works. I told him the last time I tried that was at a hunting lodge three years ago and I hadn't slept all night. I tried that. Anyway, what Roger was cooking, I remember a pile of brown sugar and apples. At first I thought it was going to be an apple pie or something like that. Also it was a pile of chocolate, chocolate with almonds in it, and he was making some dish out of this. It had a foreign name to it. He told me what it was,  but I can't remember what it was.
