I'm with my father - a priest - in his office in a church (or some such place), a nice old building, lots of dark wood and heavy furniture. I work with him, and we're getting ready to leave for another church, not far away, even older. [Scene changes.] The new place looks medieval, and we're in a dim stone room with lamps. There's a woman here, must be some kind of administrator, here to work with us, getting things organized. She's got on this fabulous headdress, it's somewhat Slavic in shape, hard side pieces that extend round to the back and continue in a long sort of tail. It's red, with heavy beading, wonderful. I tell her I like it, and she agrees, she just had to have it, got it just recently (at a fair or something). She's blonde, rather fleshy, friendly but not especially jolly. My father is somewhat like Andy Griffith... We are going to see my brother in the hospital [he's not My brother]. It's quite a complicated place, high security - not for casual patients, these are also psychiatric patients, and convicts. My brother did something, and he's been here for treatment. They've put us in this room that you wait in off the elevator. There's nothing here but some lounge-type furniture, and nobody tells us anything. Sometimes we hear announcements over a loudspeaker. My father goes away to do something - we've been waiting a long time and we're getting impatient. I wait longer and longer, and finally pick up the wall phone and start to ask them to investigate. But just then my brother is brought in. We hug and kiss, it's very emotional, he's very lonely. He looks okay, not great, but getting better, but so sad. He keeps kissing and touching me, and I'm a little uncomfortable with it - I wonder if not being around women for so long he's also wanting to touch me just because I'm a woman.
