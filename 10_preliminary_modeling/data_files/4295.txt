["Biking with Charla to M City."] I and Charla are going on my bike to M City but first we take a "small" detour to a special restaurant for breakfast. We get there to discover snow on the ground. I have a hard time parking the van. I can't seem to find a place close enough that leaves room for the lift to open. When we get out and get up to the door of the restaurant, we find out there is a 45 minute wait or more as the restaurant is full. We decide to go on. Back in the van, we go sliding down a very steep driveway back to the road. We are on the bike now and bouncing over the large rocks that are like gravel on the side of the road. It is going to take us 5 hours to get over the mountain to M City for Thanksgiving dinner. I am tired already. Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
