I am traveling up a mountain to get to a meeting. I arrive and go into the meeting room. Nice people are wandering around. It is time to look outside and see the Great Lunum which was predicted to occur on June 11th. It is some spiritual prophesy that the world will have some special illuminecence that will be so incredibly beautiful and iridescent. I open the door and go out. I see two rainbows, beautiful clouds near a mountain. I notice that the Lunum isn't there, and wonder why we would want it anyway. Just plain ordinary nature is so beautiful, why would we want to add anything? I also chuckle at the people who came all the way up this mountain to see the view and all we can see is the inside of the fog.
