I was swimming with Barney, Mike, my husband and indeterminate other people in a big lake. Barney and some other people had these dark blue surf-type things with motors which they were riding. Barney was having all sorts of difficulty with his, and seemed to be drowning. So someone got him and carried him into the first aid station, which was in the lodge by the lake. Mike and I went after them. We were in bathing suits (my bikini) and caused a sort of sensation in the staid dining rooms we were going through. I felt a little awkward to be going to see Barney since I really hardly knew him, but I wanted to go. He seemed happy to see me. Mike left after a few minutes, and Barney said he would like for me to stay, so I did. I was holding his head in my lap, and one of my breasts was partly out of my swimming suit. He kissed it and said it was a sweet spot. I was sexy and tender and also surprised at how I was doing this very unusual thing for me of acting, not really particularly forward, but just the way I felt like acting, and that I wasn't being rebuffed.
