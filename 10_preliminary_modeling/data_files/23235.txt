I discovered a bear in our garage-a large one.  I hoped it wouldn't see me, but it did.  I got my son Burt's 22 and tried to shoot it, knowing that one bullet would not stop it.  Indeed, it had little or no effect.  I had difficulty reloading, one bullet at a time, and I had to cock the gun like a shotgun.  I had difficulty getting it back into shooting position every time.  Finally someone came with a bigger gun and shot it in the head.
