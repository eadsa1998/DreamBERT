In possibly an extension of the previous dream, since it also involves John Forster, I am planning to commit suicide by ingesting some inedible substance and washing it down with a small quantity of gasoline.  John Forster and a couple of other people are there, and they show an interest in what I am doing, but make no effort to stop me.
