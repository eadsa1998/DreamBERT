I was at my birth home. I was standing at the kitchen window looking out. A car pulled up and turned into the driveway across the road. It used to be the driveway to Alig's house but their house was no longer there. The driveway was now flat and led back into the woods. There was a sign at the entrance of the driveway that faced the road and said Old Country Store. There was a log fence along the drive. I told Mother that I didn't realize that Alig's house was no longer there and that someone had put in that store. I was now in a car with Bill C and someone else. They wanted to see this country store so we were driving back the long driveway. I had the impression that they were expecting something like a Country General Store. I told them to keep in mind that we were in St. Joe and they shouldn't expect the typical in St. Joe. They dismissed me saying something to the effect that I shouldn't be critical. We got back to the store and walked in. There were two rooms to the store, a front room and a back room. There was a woman, perhaps my age or younger, or owned and operated the store. The front room was nothing but candles. We entered the back room and it was nothing but more candles. We came back from the front room and Bill C and the other person with us was somewhat incredulous that it was a candle store. I wanted to tell them that I warned them but I didn't. I was standing looking out a window of the store. There was a woman with long black hair lying on her back in the gravel playing with her dog. I mentioned this to Bill C. As we walked out of the store she moved over into the grass. I thought I recognized her. As we were pulling away in the car I realized it was Georgia D from high school.
