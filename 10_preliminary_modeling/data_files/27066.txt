This dream took place in a hospital, I don't think I was aware of the exact hospital. I was taking care of my closest friend a young married girl of 22 yrs. I went to plug the light into the wall socket, but before I could water started flowing out of it. It began coming faster and flooding the room. I was unable to stop it. I went out to the desk, called some one to come to repair it. When I returned to the room the water seemed to be a couple of feet high so I moved the bed out of the room down the hall by the desk, but the water seemed to continue to flow down the hall - What happened after that I can't remember Don't know if the water was turned off or not.
