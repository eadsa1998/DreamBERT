I am made president and it makes a man nervous. He tells me if I don't think I can do it, I'd better step down because otherwise I'll be jeopardizing others. Then I am introducing Eddie D and his wife to the President Ronald Reagan. Eddie is overcome and cries and hugs the president. Then I am dabbing hot milk on my nipples. So is Arvonne in the other room. It hurts and we are saying "Oh, ouch," etc.
