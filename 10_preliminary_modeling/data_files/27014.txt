I was traveling somewhere by bicycle with several other girls and somehow I got separated from them -- it seems to me that people that knew me kept stopping me and asking me questions, thus detaining me from catching up with my friends. I remember riding up out a hill with a building on it and seeing a trail going into the woods. I started to ride onto this train but realized that it would soon be dark (it was 5:45) and I didn't want to be lost in the woods after dark - so I returned to the hill with a very frustrated feeling at having lost my friends. I remember having said "hello" to my sister as I was trying to catch up -- she didn't detain me, though.
