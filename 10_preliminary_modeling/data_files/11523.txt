For some reason I was making a phone call to find someone whose first name was Stankey. The phone rang. I ran to answer it but no one answered. As I sat there waiting I had a tremendous pain in my upper back tooth. To relieve the pain I gritted them. The more the pain the more I gritted them. As a result the tooth began to crumble. Running to the kitchen sink, I spit out piece after piece of broken tooth. (There was no sign of blood.) I returned to the phone and this Stankey was waiting quite impatiently. All the time I wished I hadn't made the call in fact from the very beginning. The result of it, if any at all, I have forgotten.
