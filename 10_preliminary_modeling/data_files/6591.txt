There had been some disaster, a fire? I was in the basement of a building. Someone said "There has been plenty of water." I saw various pumping devices.  I started to men's w.c. and met B. T. coming out. Surprised that neither of us is embarrassed. He talked quite friendly to me. Getting ready for train trip. Hurrying to pack. Finally all done and put on wraps, good coat and best hat. I have two suitcases but Joe, a little boy, is not ready. His things must be packed. He has too much and must choose what to take. Tell him will miss train. I find my watch is fast and so less hurry. On train with mother. She is wearing an old blue morning dress and is waiting at the w.c. I am provoked that she is wearing that old dress. The car has dark red seats in three rows, two of single seats and one of double. Someone stops train and gets off to pick up something she has dropped through  w.c. Mother and I at end of car. Mother drops nickel, gets down after it and gets back in wrong car. I tell her to hurry as train might leave without her. Look under cars. See dirty river, puddles on bank and trash thrown out. See people on boat in river. It is almost swamping. Train is mow a steamer and go to rescue.
