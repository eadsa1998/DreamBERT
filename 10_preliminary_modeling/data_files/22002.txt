I was in a kingdom. I was kind of protecting the king. I watched for any developments, then would advise the king where and what to do. There was someone coming to get the king. I went with the king thru different rooms and we eluded the trap. Then I was by St. Andrew's Parish and the fellows wanted me to play ball with them. One fellow was pointing and waving at me to come and play on his team. I changed my shoes to play ball and when I looked at the change, I had the brand new shoes on, so I had to change to old shoes.
