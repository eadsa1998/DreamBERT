I was dating Jason Segel. There was a weird place which involved a stereo speaker where you would go onto a 'pixel' which had a little squishy bit of sand with water. He took me there and we lay down and he got on top of me and kissed me. We hadn't had sex yet. We had dated in secret for a while but some old guy worked it out and started hinting about it to other people. There was a pregnant lady. We were with some people later, including Mom. She invited me and Jason Segel for pancakes and he was making jokes. For some reason they thought I didn't want to eat pancakes. I said that I did and we went.
