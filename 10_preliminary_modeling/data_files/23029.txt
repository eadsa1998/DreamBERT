It was almost 7:00 p.m. and I had the TV on.  It was a color TV, I believe, and was located in one corner (the right hand corner) of the end of a room which was longer than it was wide.  I expected to watch the CBS evening news at 7:00, but as I was leaving the room momentarily, I heard an announcement to the effect of "Stay tuned for Father Knows Best."  The announcement was cut short, so I thought it must have been a mistake.  Before I came back in the room, though, I could hear, "...with Elinor Donavan, Billy Green, and Lauren Chapel," and I knew it was true.  I came back in and switched the dial, and Walter Cronkite was just coming on the local CBS channel.  He seemed rather disorganized, and the picture wasn't very good, but I was still torn between watching that or Father Knows Best, which I hadn't seen in a long time.  I finally decided for the latter, but found it done in a rather strange format.  Bud was narrating something about Betty as she was shown going to or coming from school, and gentle nostalgic music was playing in the background.
