["Uncle Lionel an actor."] I am in an auditorium where my Uncle Lionel, who I call Grandfather has joined some performance group that teaches about logging and sawing skills. He is showing off his work to me. His troupe all gather around me and are friendly. One man is attracted to me. I am now sitting in an overstuffed chair. The troupe is focusing their show toward me. One man is on my left with a saw devise on the left arm of the chair demonstrating it. Another man is behind me demonstrating something else. I see on the stage area my Uncle a part of an acrobatic piece where they saw in half huge logs of paper rolls and then tumble down into a trampoline safety net. Then more troupers come out, one woman like Bonnie (with stroke) playing the fiddle. Now two dogs come up to me, each carrying candy or a small toy in their mouths for me to have. One is a pink poodle and very clever, returning a small tootsie roll candy back to a small platform around its neck. Someone hands me a kitten. I cuddle it and say oh no. I can't accept another cat. You need to take it away quickly before I can't return it, because I will like it too much. The troupe says "UH-OH" like they made a mistake and take the kitty back. I'm already rethinking the decision. Now I am getting involved in the acting. They move an actor to another room and I follow him. The troupe joins us and I am given a small green animal mask to hold and I am to go back to the audience and say the name of this character. I hear Chris Dilloncake. They frown and repeat the name. I can't seem to understand the last name correctly. It ends up sounding like MobCake.
