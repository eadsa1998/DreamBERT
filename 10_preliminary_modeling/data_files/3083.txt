I am in a basement and there are two men around and somehow they are letting in this plant which if it touches me will envelope me and I will die. It comes for me. I back away, perhaps screaming and saying, "NO NO NO." It wraps around me and is sucking me dry. I wake up in terror and don't want to go back to sleep.
