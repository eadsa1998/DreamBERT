["Lucy and remembering the words."] I am outdoors. Preparing for a performance. I walk chest deep across a river to a cave. Inside the cave are the props and Lucy. I am trying to remember my lines. I notice we are so far back into the cave that any audience across the river couldn't see us or hear us very well. So I move and Lucy comes with me to the open mouth of the cave. I try to read my script pages but can't find my place. So I just start improving lines, from the heart. Now we are back across the river and I see some people up on the outdoor stage preparing to give some awards. I am prepared to go get one. I am called and go up on stage. I am bantering with some other actors as I do that.
