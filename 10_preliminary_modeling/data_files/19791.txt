I was working at a printing plant. A large press was there, but I couldn't get it to operate. My mother came with clothes to change into. I was undressing and clad only in my shirt when I recalled a small container that I wanted to take with me when I left with my mother. I looked around the room for it, still clad only in the shirt.
