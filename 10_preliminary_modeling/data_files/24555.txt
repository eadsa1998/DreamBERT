I was outside kicking around my soccer ball and then saw my neighbor Mike hobbling around on crutches. Then his brother JC came out on fake crutches and started yelling at him. Setting: My front yard. Characters: My neighbors, JC (who is 11) and Mike, his brother who is 12. Feelings and Thoughts: I felt really happy because I don't see them very often and they're really good friends. I have a crush on JC.
