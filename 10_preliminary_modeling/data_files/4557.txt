["Swimming marathon race around the block."] I am in a swimming contest of endurance. A marathon. They have flooded the city streets and I swim the street, around the block. Sometimes there is deep enough water to swim. Sometimes there is only a few inches to crawl through. I struggle on, determined to last a long time. Only a few people are interested. Then the water refreshes deeper. I count the laps. I am up to seven laps. The town people start to gather to cheer me on. The water is almost gone. Then suddenly it gushes out of the manholes and I see several waves of rushing water coming down the street. I am happy. I swim in the roiling water. I am exhausted but won't give up on this last lap of the marathon. I struggle. The water becomes dark green and murky filling with moss and algae stuff. I continue on stroke by stroke. I somehow get into the under parking area of a hotel. I swim back out to the street. People are cheering, encouraging me. I finish the 8th lap. Exhausted but happy I was successful.
