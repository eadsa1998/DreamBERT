I was coming home from college. I was rather peeved because I had to come home on the streetcar. It was Christmas time and I had a lot to bring home. The trouble was that I had so many small suitcases that I couldn't' keep count of them. I went to my grandmother's house because that is where we always have Christmas dinner. I felt hurt because when I got there, everyone was eating and no one had waited for me. After dinner I went into the bedroom and there was a large suitcase, big enough for all my stuff. I asked my aunt to whom the larger suitcase belonged, to please give me the suitcase, but she said no I couldn't have it.
