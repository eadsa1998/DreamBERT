Setting was half in gym class and half overlooking the beach. It was familiar. I dreamed of old friends in California and new ones all together in one place - my age, mostly girls and people I was friends with. I was happy, completely happy. I was in gym class with my new gym teacher with old and new friends. We had to line up. I remember bright pink dice, the furry kind people hang on their car mirrors. I saw things from Minnesota and California. Then I had to go with this girl to the nurse's office and we got there by running on the beach. Along the way I kept finding pennies in the sand. That was the end.
