Pedro and I are at a Restaurant, waiting to be seated; I go to the bathroom and when I return I find that I left my purse in the bathroom; Pedro gets seated, but instead of joining him, I find myself walking outside in the snow, crossing a wide street, nearly missing several cars; I look for the restaurant and can't find it. I ask a clerk in a movie lobby for the name of the restaurant across the street; I feel very foolish and I don't know if I ever find it......
