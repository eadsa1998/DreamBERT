Piece of paper with cells on it. There aren't very many. One of them is about 6 inches wide and about 4 or 5 inches tall. Someone is making breakfast for me. They have made scrambled eggs. They used a fresh herb, and apparently a lot of it because there is a lot of green in the eggs. They put the eggs in this one large cell on this piece of paper, laying in front of me on the table. I was using my fork and kind of poking at the eggs and talking to the person who had made them. We're talking about what a good breakfast this is as far as it being healthy.
