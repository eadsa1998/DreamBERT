I was forced to go to a Lady Gaga concert. It was very small and there were seats placed around. I yawned and fidgeted and told the person next to me that I had to review it. Before she came on, they played a 2 hour weird movie. I saw Calvin in the audience but he seemed normal. We played this 'game' to pass out from alcohol. Some time later, there were new words on my shirt. After the show there was something related to a game or movie that cost $16 and Calvin wanted to buy it. We called someone and they said the password was 'Bald', but he ended up not doing it. I was then at home and everything seemed weird. I was talking to Benjamin on MSN and he asked if I like his posts because they're cute or 'make you want to put the cat down' or because they were funny.
