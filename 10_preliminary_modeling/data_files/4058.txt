["Landslides"]  I am at some performance area, like an outdoor stadium built into the hillside. I am looking for an aisle I can walk up. But each aisle is crowded with people. I finally find one at the end and walk up it. Now at the top I am walking across mountainous terrain. Suddenly, a  landslide slide starts under my feet and I scramble hard to move off it without falling. Each time I get to a more secure footing, a new landslide would start. I scramble hard until I reach the edge where it is more secure.
