I threw some small pebbles at a skylight in the roof of some girl's room.  She was keeping my daughter Christina, and thus I was admitted to her room.  The girl was in bed, and Christina was in a bed next to hers.  While I was there, someone else began throwing stones against the window.  I think it was John Fouts.  I didn't want to let him in, but then I heard the voice of the girl's mother asking what was going on, who was there, etc., and announcing that she was coming in to investigate.  I grabbed the guy's arm and pulled him in through the window, and then I climbed out on to the room, making as little noise as possible.  It was night, and I planned to hide in some shadows on the roof right away, in case anyone looked out the window for me.
