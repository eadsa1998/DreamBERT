I am nervous and sitting on a toilet, having belly cramps. Rochelle is around asking me questions about why I act the way I do. I explain, something about getting nervous and needing to go to the bathroom. I see my mother and say something like, "It's not like you ever taught us how to be emotionally intimate." Then I am spreading thick gobs of butter on already buttered toast. [BL]
