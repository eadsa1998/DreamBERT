I had to take an exam in the psych lab. When I entered, there were tables over the whole place. The lab was just one room, not the way it actually is. There were chairs along the wall all occupied with people who are proctors. There seemed to be more of them than students taking the exam. One girl, a student from Guilford house, was one of these proctors who had a bright blue outfit. She was sitting with her legs crossed and her head supported in her hand which in turn was resting on her knee. Another proctor had on a coat with a wide green band on the bottom and then fur. As I came in the lab, I remarked to whom I was with, that there are more people to see that we don't cheat than there are kids taking the exam.
