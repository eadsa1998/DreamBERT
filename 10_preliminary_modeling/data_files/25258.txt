 I'm at Brimson College and the new school year is beginning. I don't have any clothes! I find a few pairs of pants, but no shirts. I have hauled my stuff down to school in my truck. I arrived really late, about 10:00 pm the day that classes began. I meet a few new people, including women who aren't that attractive. My friend from high school Tiny Combs is there for a big party to kick off the school year.
