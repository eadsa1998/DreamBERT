 I'm in a parking lot. My roommate Stephen Ramos is there. There is a tent set up for an event. It seems like we are taking part in the event. Our classmate Yolana Ginsburg comes up and says hi. I say, "Hi, Yolanda." No one else says hi. The others are ignoring her. There is a man there who is in charge of the event.
