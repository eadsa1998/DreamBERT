I was driving Jovan Toski and his family somewhere in a small car with a manual transmission.  I told him it was just like the Fico, and he laughed.  I wanted to get across a wide river like the Largo  in my hometown, but I couldn't figure out how to get there in order to get where I wanted to go.  I kept coming back to a waterfront where the access was closed, and South Africa was on the other side of the river.  That wasn't where I wanted to go.
