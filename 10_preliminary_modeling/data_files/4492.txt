["Capture and escape."] I am one of many captured people, all kept in long rows. The large face of the owner alien is projected like on a big screen. He demands I do something. I am exhausted and fed up with being a slave. I refuse. Everyone stares at me with horror, expecting me to be killed instantly. The owner is angry and demands again that I do it. I refuse again. Then one other joins me and then another until we all refuse. We have won. I then attempt to escape by crawling under all the people in the rows but my progress in seen because I disrupt the people and their movements show where I'm going. I then crawl back toward a fence and leap over the fence. A large alien woman sees me and tells. I then am in a bathroom where I am going to take a bath as I've been so dirty and ill kept for so long. But a man I used to be married to leaps into the tub and lies there naked and grinning at me. I get in the tub anyway. I want that bath. He likes me and has very sensual full lips. A good looking man. Tall and well built. Dark curly hair. His wish for me feels like Howard. I try to ignore him as I stand in the tub showering and washing. I get out and see several boys, perhaps my abandoned children wet and near by. I reach out to dry off the hair of one of them. He flinches away from my touch. He doesn't want to believe in my love because he will be hurt again. I gently rub his hair and arm with the towel. He really wants to relax into the love. I feel sad for what I did to him.
