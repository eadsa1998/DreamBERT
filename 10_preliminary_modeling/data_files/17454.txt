I was in a parking lot waiting for my mother, and I decided to go check on her.  She had run into my godfather Ben's ex wife and their eldest son in a store.  I thought that was odd since I'd just seen their younger son and Ben in a different store.  Then, I sat at a table in the dark outside a hair place.  There were four other people there.  We were taking a test.  I read through the first page without recognizing the questions as questions.  I went back and answered the first few.  One asked for a catchy name.  I thought of Cuttage Cheese but that didn't make sense.  I was going to put 'Welcome to our Cuttage' but with using markers and stencils- more, I realized, than I had to do, and I screwed up.  I had only gotten as far as 'Welco' and I had started to put 'cheese factory,' not 'cuttage'.  I looked into the sky to see a small cloud moving fast, rotating.  It drifted down towards us.  It was like a spider web- a thread with letters.  It was a poem.  I snatched it and set it aside to read after the test, though.  I was near giving up.  I was behind in time.  The others were practically done.  I saw the reason they were hiring.  An 80-year-old lady kind of 'lost it'.  She argued over leaving.
