I dreamed that I was in a chemistry laboratory performing some experiments. It apparently was a class since a professor was present, although I didn't recognize him. Each of us had half an orange from which we squeezed the juice, so that we could experiment both on the juice and on the outside rind. At the end of the period I locked my locker and returned the key to the proper position on a board hanging by the door.
