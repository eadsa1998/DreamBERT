I was looking for my yoga class. It was a big empty gym with 3 classes going on. The perky cheerleader type was teaching what was SUPPOSE to be a yoga class, but I did not particularly want to get involved with her so I was waiting for the other teachers. About this time the cheerleading yoga teacher found the insides of a telephone and a plastic phone cover and she kept trying to put them together. She was NOT successful. While watching her flail, I was assembling the phone parts in my head according to spatial relationships. I figured it out by watching for the little holes for cords and the previous scribbling of old extension numbers on the quick-dial. I put the phone together for her and we plugged it in. The jack line was about 20 feet long and we sat the phone on the floor away from the wall. She watched it, waiting for it to ring. I went out on the front porch ??? in fact, my blanket. It was all wet. I spread it out on the front porch of the log cabin, but rain was coming in sideways, so I knew it'd take a long time to dry. (While) waiting for it to dry, I leaned out over the rail and saw a huge alligator in the creek. He was waiting patiently to chomp somebody at the first opportunity. About this time, Diane came in frantic to publish a newsletter about Elizabeth. She wanted for me to write why Elizabeth's life had been so great. But it was NOT. She was unhappy. That's why she died. Then she wanted me to draw a complicated picture on a tacky green and purple sale flyer. Dora came to get me out of the bind and she said, "Have you been through the line?" She took my arm gently and brought me over to the Bleffel gathering. I said, "Are those green beans or green peas?" And then Uncle Gene started cracking jokes about green beans
