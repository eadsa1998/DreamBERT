We were with Melinda's family again, and we were staying in a house. It was probably Tyler and Amber, but it was this fairly big house. It was modern-looking and there was this room with this huge king-sized bed. And get this -- this is so weird! Chelsea and Josh and Frieda and Zane -- those two couples -- and Charmane and David wanted to do it all in the same bed. [laugh] And there was enough room because it was this huge king-sized bed. And [laugh] there was this young girl about 19 or 20, maybe 27, Hannah her name was, and she's like, "Come lay down with me, Jessie, come lay down with me," and I was real, real hesitant because I didn't want to get in the middle of all that stuff going all over everywhere. And she had her back to all of them and I laid down with her, and next thing I know I went to sleep and then I woke up. And during that, they were all like sharing things and sharing pads and sharing condoms and stuff. It was like going to a public bath and watching everybody bathe, but this was going to a public bed. [laugh]
