Bicycle ride: over a rough road, almost fall off (right handle bar is missing; I forget to pick up the Rolands' kids; - then suddenly riding a new bicycle: good gears: I am going back to pick up the kids and end up at Betty-Jo's (Mastrey - they had restaurant). See her with Mia (her daughter) and with Toni (her husband); we play with the kids; very happy; we have lots to talk about, but I can't stay.
