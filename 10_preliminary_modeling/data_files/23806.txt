Next dream:  I was approaching or in front of Disch's garage door in a small car.  It didn't look like his house, it had a long driveway and seemed to be out in the country, but I knew it was his place.  I paused very near the garage door, but I knew I would block his hearse in if I parked there, and he might have to get to a funeral, so I did a U-turn in the driveway, went back out the driveway, looking for a place to park, and went to his other garage area and parked.  Then a few people and I were in this other garage, it seemed like Lynn and his friends.  We were taking things or doing things to his stuff in there, things we wouldn't have wanted Disch to know about.  Then Disch, and I think Penny too, came out in the garage, but they either didn't notice or didn't care that we were in there or what we were doing.
