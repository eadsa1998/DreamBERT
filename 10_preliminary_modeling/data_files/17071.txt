I was with all of my close friends from high school. We were at my friend Mark's house, but it was different than his actual house. My friends Mark, Steve, Ron, Sam, Nick and Hal. It was strange that Hal was there because Mark doesn't like Hal. We were drinking and hanging out when Mark and Hal started fighting and punching each other. Everybody just stood there and watched. You could tell who liked Mark more, because they stood behind him. Finally, Ron pulled them apart. I was sitting in a pool with Hal. We were talking about how messed up the fight was. We knew that three of them weren't friends with Hal, also, but Ron, Nick and I were. I explained to Hal that it was wrong that Nick sided only with Mark, whereas Ron and I were really torn. We were back at Mark's house, in his kitchen. Hal wasn't there. I had made a frozen pizza, and Ron put it in the refrigerator. When I took it out, there were bite marks in it. I looked at Ron, and he laughed, finding his act humorous. I pretended I was mad and we started play fighting. We started wrestling.
