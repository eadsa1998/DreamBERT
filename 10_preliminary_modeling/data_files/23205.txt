I am sitting at round table in a departmental office with Jack Ramsay.  He is making preparations for his classes, and I am filing folders for test-takers, inserting new ones numerically into a batch which are already in order.  It is easy except for the fact that when you pick a bunch up together, they are and slide out.  Max Ardol comes in with a guy I have never seen and introduces him as Bob Bethel.  Says he wants to observe a class.  I tell him I don't have one because I am retired.  He says "Welcome to the club."  I take that to mean that he is retired too.   Next, all those guys are gone, and Patrice Pottier comes in and sits down at the table with some paper work of her own.  I ask her if she can help me by inserting just two folders into a section which I give her.  She says, "What, do they not want you to have a heart attack from overwork or something?"   Although she is smiling when she says it, I take it as an indication that she sees the request as an imposition, and I am kind of taken aback.  I tell her it is only two folders and the others are already in order.
