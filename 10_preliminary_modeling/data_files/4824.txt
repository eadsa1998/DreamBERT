["Gaston and me."] Gaston comes over to visit. I have never seen this place before, in waking life. Gaston is fixing us something good to eat. He is also very affectionate. I contemplate making love to him. I seems a nice thing to do. We kiss and are affectionate. Then Gaston bends over and places his genital area near my face. I tell him I don't like that. He says OK. And we return to the affectionate stuff.
