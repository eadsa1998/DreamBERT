I was living in this horrible apartment with hundreds of bugs, it was falling apart and smelled. My parents were visiting and my mother was asleep in a room. My dad and sister went to a comedy club; I told them that I'd show up later. It was around 8:00 pm and I spent hours trying to decide what to wear. Then I went for a walk for some reason and when I came back to the apartment, I walked up the front stairs of the building (they were steep and winding stairs). This man ran up to me and grabbed me and was yelling (he was kind of mentally ill). He held me over the edge of the stairs and was threatening to push me over. I begged him not to, but he kept saying he would. I was crying and pleading. Then he stopped and just left. I went in and walked through these long hallways. When I got to my apartment, there was a girl (homeless) laying on the floor in front of my door. She asked if she could stay at my place. I said no because my parents were here -- it wasn't a good idea. She left. I unlocked the door and went in. I realized it was 2:00 am -- too late to go to the comedy club because it would be closed. Then I realized there was a new door in the apartment that was unlocked and led to the other hallway. I got scared. I waited for hours -- my dad and sister never came back and I was afraid to check on my mother -- I was scared something had happened to her. I just sat there and did nothing. I couldn't move -- I was paralyzed.
