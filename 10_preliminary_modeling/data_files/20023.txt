I had to insert something in something I had written. Later my sister and I ran for a subway and I missed it. I took a bus. As we drove through streets with tall buildings, I felt closed in. I wanted to ride to where my sister would get off the subway, but I was past the station when I left the bus. I was worried about my sister waiting for me. I called a taxi. I only had foreign coins. I had paid the bus fare with foreign coins.
