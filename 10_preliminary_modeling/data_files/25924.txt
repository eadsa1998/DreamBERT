 There is a woman who is picked up and transported with a laser by three alien people. She has a gun and is on roller skates. She seems to be a police officer. The laser moves her to another place where she keeps acting as if she were in the first place. She falls into a water drainage area, and gets pulled into a big water tunnel. The woman is a partner with Arnold Schwarzeneggar. Arnold is at the gymnasium with his adversary, competing by doing one-legged jumping calf raises. He gets a phone call. It is the woman, his partner.
