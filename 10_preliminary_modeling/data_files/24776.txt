I was on a wagon going West with my family. My brother and I had our swim bags and we put them and the piece of wood underneath the wagon. Everyone had clipboards with pieces of paper on it and a pencil. Then we stopped at an amusement park and I wanted to go on the rollercoaster. I got in line and ended up in this old temple/pyramid thing. I did some religious thing with other people. I then got in a fight with laser beams with some other people. Then I went with my friend Cindy and my brother to a hair salon. I looked in the mirror and I had black lipstick on. The hairstylist told me to go into the changing room and put on a green robe-like thing. Cindy and I and my brother went into the changing room and got a robe and went into this weird dressing stall. We started to change into it when a lady came into the same stall and said, "I'll only be a minute," and she started changing, too. On my way into the changing room I saw a jellybelly machine that was metal. It said, "Take one only if you need it." In the dream, I remembered that Cindy had some jellybellies. I had brought them to swim team. Setting: Near Shasta Lake and in a hair salon. Characters: Parents - not my real ones. Sister - looked like Hodel from Fiddler on the Roof. Nice people at amusement parks. Cindy - my friend in true life, nice funny. Campbell - my real brother, nice. Lady in stall - weird. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, scared. Scared in temple/pyramid. I thought it was a strange dream, but a lot of things that are in the dream reflect what happened not very long ago in the real world.
