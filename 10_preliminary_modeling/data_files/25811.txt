 I'm with my friend Yvette Ullman. We're in the Uptown Mall in Oak Valley. We go to eat lunch in Target. We're in a hurry. It's 11:58am, and we have to be back in two minutes! I get a thick sandwich with turkey, chicken, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise, and three pieces of bread. My friends Emerald Reinhold and Holly Lapson are at the food counter when we go in. I get four little packages. I pay for the sandwiches, not for the things in the packages. Somehow I manage to go through the register without paying. This may be due to a mistake of an employee which I took advantage of. I steal the packages. I go the bathroom and rip up the UPC codes of the packages so the theft sensor won't pick them up as I leave the store, and the alarm won't sound. My classmate from Brimson named Donovan comes out of a stall in the bathroom. I put all my things in a plastic bag. There are many other bags in the bag, and some envelopes. I go out of the store. The alarm sounds. Security is there. In my bag are a razor, a tweezers, and some kind of small pointy poker. I also have my half eaten sandwich. The security guard is a black man. I sit at a table with other black people. Another black security guard is there. I say I don't know what happened: why the razor, tweezers, or poker is there.
