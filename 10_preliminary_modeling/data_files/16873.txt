I was attending a gig with a couple of friends. Strangely our plan was to get into the very large venue, then to do our hair. We've brought pots of hair products and combs in plastic bags. Amongst the huge crowds I managed to lose my bag and my wallet. It was a disaster - I felt like a complete idiot.
