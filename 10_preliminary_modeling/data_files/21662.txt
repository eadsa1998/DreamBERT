I was on a ship or it came in. I am not sure. The numbers were called 606 and 166, and a couple of other numbers. I looked down at the water. It looked like a small brook and still we said the boat will go down this stream to the ocean. The sailors were wading thru the shallow water to shore. I started to wade and I noticed I had a pair of hip boots on. The sailors were drinking some kind of pop out of bottles. We were outside and the clouds came low. The wind blew and I touched a scruped cloud and it started to snow. Then there was snow on the ground. A man asked for a hot tip and this fellow was indebted to the other fellow, so he gave this fellow the tip. He said scruped. We had a lot of company at our house, friends of our daughters and our friends and some of my wife's. One friend had a one-wheel lawn mower. I lay on the grass and he ran it over my cheek.
