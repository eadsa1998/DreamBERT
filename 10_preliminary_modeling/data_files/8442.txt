I was in my car driving down a narrow, winding road that looked like it was on the side of a mountain. I couldn't see more than a few feet in front of me. It was dusk, not totally dark and the road was black, which made it even more treacherous. I quickly realized I was going way too fast and that I was in a very dangerous situation. I applied my brakes to try to stop and then proceed very slowly. I couldn't stop and it hardly felt that I slowed down at all. Snow appeared on the ground. I thought the road was now covered by snow so I couldn't even see if I was still on the road. I realized that I was no longer on the road but the depth of the snow slowed me down and caused me to come to a stop. There were people walking nearby who approached my car to see if I was okay and to see if I could help. One man's name was Bryan Thomas [unknown in waking life]. We were in a room talking when he said something that implied he was supposed to meet me and he just realized why - that we are to be life partners. Oddly, I didn't feel any strong emotion around this one way or the other. He was a physically nice looking man, not much taller than I with thick, black hair. But I didn't know him or know anything about him as a person so there was no reason for me to feel excited about this prospect or to feel anything negative about it. He didn't exhibit much emotion around it either, one way or the other. He did seem ready to accept the idea and move forward to make it reality. I did appreciate that he seemed to be a nice man and that he wanted to help with my car situation.
