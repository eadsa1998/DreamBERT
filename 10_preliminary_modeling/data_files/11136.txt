I dreamt that my cousin in Cleveland had a pet seal and it followed her everywhere she went. In fact, she carried a handbag that was big enough to carry the seal in. I was afraid to get too close to it. Then my dream switched to Tommy, my cat. I dreamt that he was alive again, yet I still couldn't quite believe it, so mother made him do all the tricks he used to do to prove it to me. As he is doing these tricks, he jumps out the window and over the stone wall in the alley and is gone. Then the dream ends.
