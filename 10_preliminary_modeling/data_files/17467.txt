I dreamt about being at school.  It was rainy.  I saw some blue slippers and realized they were my online friend Del's from when he stayed over during spring break.  I started carrying them back, but ran into him and they said I had to stop on my way 'back up' to do something, not realizing the person in the back seat waiting impatiently for me to take them home.  I walked back through my environmental ethics lecture hall.
