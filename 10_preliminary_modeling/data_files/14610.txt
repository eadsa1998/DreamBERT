I was at home, but then we were going somewhere. Mom and Ezra were in the front of the car and Roland and I were in the back. We were passing Dog Swamp shops and I was thirsty and my water bottle was almost empty, though it had been full when we left. Roland said someone should play Runescape and I said I was going to earlier, but had played World of Warcraft instead. We got to the train station and were waiting for a bus. Roland was wearing a black shirt that said 'Rainbow' in red and I realized it was the band. The bus came and it was the 451 and I then realized we needed to take a train. Mom wouldn't listen to me, and then she did. She went to the toilet to check herself in the mirror. Ezra tried to draw on my face with a red texta.
