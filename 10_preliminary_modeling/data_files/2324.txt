I go to a woman's house with a pair of pants/shorts for my 36-month-old boy I have in her daycare center. Someone says, "You know you're here when you see the spectacular view," and I turn and see beautiful waterfalls that crash and splash back up the mountain. Then the woman says, "Look out! Here comes the god in the waterfall," and I see a man-shaped waterfall flying around in the air. Everyone is respectful of the power energy and unpredictable nature of this god. I'm now sitting in the back seat of a car with the woman. The god of the waterfall comes to my window and likes me. He's like a man at the moment - full lips, a little plump and sensual. He asks me for a kiss. I agree if he'll exchange one wish for one kiss. He agrees and then floats into the car and we kiss. I kiss very well. He loves it. He's not the best kisser, kind of limp and open-mouthed, but I feel strong tenderness and warmth that I like. Then I try to decide what to wish for. I think about health and happiness and then decide to wish for creativity, the words I need to really write excellent work. He agrees to grant my wish.
