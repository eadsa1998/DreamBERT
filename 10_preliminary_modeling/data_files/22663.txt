My brother used to study at the School of Detectives of Peru, and not too long ago he started to work; that's how the dream begins. I must point out that my brother was already working in Apurimac, Abancay. It continues this way: Since I think that his work is dangerous, my brother was killed, I cried inconsolably due to the loss of my brother. So that Mother would not see, I went in the bathroom and cried there. They had already buried my brother, but in my dream I said that it wasn't true, that it couldn't be true, and so sleeping and dreaming, I was crying real tears. They were running down my cheeks, but I kept saying that it was a lie, that my brother hadn't died. Then I awoke and looked at his bed and saw it was empty, and then I thought that it was true and that he had died and I started to scream desperately. My father ran to see what was happening and asked me what was the matter and I told him that my brother, my dear brother, where was he, was he dead? And he told me, "No, he isn't, my child, your brother is in Abancay, working; don't you remember?" Only then did I realize that it had only been a dream, a horrible dream, and that I would never want this to happen and that is why I pray to God so that he will protect my brother and my boyfriend, because both of them have the same profession, and I think it's dangerous, at least my brother's, because he is not in Lima.
