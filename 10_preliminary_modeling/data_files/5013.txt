A young girl has rheumatoid arthritis. Some people are trying to explain things to her to help her. I am crying. A nice man is going to help her. I think I am worried they can't and don't want to stir up her hopes. The man and I go into his familiar formal room. He tells me to look into a mirror with a heavy, gilded frame. I look and at first I can't see anything. Then I see me, sad, seated and a man (him). I, a happy, healthy me, stand between them trying to explain something. [BL]
