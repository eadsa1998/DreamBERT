I was setting up my sound equipment on a stage. Actually it was like on a stage out in our back yard. And I had the Peavey escort system and my CD player and I also had three inline signal processors, I had a raver (?) machine, I had an equalizer, and I had one other thing, I don't remember what it was. And so I was setting all this stuff up, and I was setting up the microphone stand, and I was getting ready to do a show and talk to the people who were sitting out there. And I don't remember what happened. Oh, I remember what happened. For some reason or another the microphone wouldn't like start feeding back for some reason and I noticed that the gauge said it wouldn't. And then I went over to the mixer and I notice that whenever I would bring it down to an appropriate level, when I would go over there and stand and talk, it would jump right back up, all the way up. And it would just keep doing that. ______ I'll duct tape in place for you, but we had to turn the system off and unplug it first, and so the show got delayed, of course. And I don't even remember if I ever did it or not. And then we were on the front porch and somebody dumped a whole basket full of kids toys on the porch and I was picking them all up [laugh] and I also had a little basket of sequins. And those three inline signal processors were like on a cart like you wheel around school, along with the big mixer. And I had the notion that I had received those as big presents for Christmas. And it was just, I was on the porch and I was talking to a whole bunch of people, and that's what it was. And then I slowly faded into consciousness.
