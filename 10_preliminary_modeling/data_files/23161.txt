My son Burt and I were trying to find Jovan's apartment in a foreign city.  I think we had already been there a couple of days, and our time left was running out (but maybe that's just because that is so often a feature of this dream).  I thought the main street was Nishi, but then I realized that I was confusing this city with Kyoto.
