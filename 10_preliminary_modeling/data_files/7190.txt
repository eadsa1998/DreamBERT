I began to distribute the bathing suits to my family (?) two men and three women. Gave the first woman a wrinkled pink suit. When I came to the men found stiff white brassieres in their suits. At first threw them away, then thought they might be changed to eyeshades for Miss Couch. Went back to find suits but couldn't find them.
