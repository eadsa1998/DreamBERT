 I'm working at Grocery Getto, on a 5-11 shift stocking shelves. There is a yellow noted by my time card that has a lost of things for me to do. I am working here temporarily, and am on a break from school. My first task is to set up a display of some sort of fruit in the front wall of sale items. I am slow and not sure what to do. There is an open space but it is really a poor space for a display. A man asks me about something for a cat, maybe for tanning a cat hide. I don't really understand him. I point to an aisle where the liquid smoke is. My bosses Larry Paulson and Jack Krane are having their photograph taken by the wall of groceries. Jack asks me about a drug test. He says something about yellow urine with white drops in it. I ask what they are testing for. My friend Tim Zelling says they're testing for butt sex. Jack tells me that the test turns out positive. I say to Jack and Larry, "I've never done drugs in my life, never had butt sex, and don't have AIDS, and if you think I do you can kiss my ass." Then I walk away. I'm on roller skates. I go out to the parcel pick up area of the store, which has been remodeled. One of the fat women who works there comes out and tells me not to shut the door. I laugh, and say I wasn't going to. I just went to this area to avoid Jack and Larry. I skate out past the cash registers. My third grade teacher Liza Minikel is working there. I think she must work in the evenings. I fall, and get back up. I skate to the back room. I cannot stop well on skates. I go through the meat display area. I grab onto stationary objects to slow me down. My coworker Jim Rammer asks me, "Did you really tell Larry and Jack to kiss your ass?" I tell Jim what I said to them. Jim tells me I am dead for saying that: will get into trouble. He and a lady and I sit in the back room talking about pets. I'm sitting where I could be crushed, in a strong machine in between two pieces of metal, like a bailer or a plow.
