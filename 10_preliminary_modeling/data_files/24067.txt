I'm in some sort of old videogame, Time Crisis One. I'm searching around some castle with bad graphics. I'm on some kind of outside exposed walkway and then I reach the top, and now I guess I'm supposed to be fighting some flying villain. She zips around and I succeed in stabbing her a few times with the spear that's in my hands. Now we're fighting in the rapids of a rushing river, and I'm hacking away at her face with a big butcher knife. Big cuts are exposed on her body after each swing, and something tells me I should be scared, but the dream isn't a nightmare or scary, even though I keep chopping away at her. This river we're fighting in runs right through the food court of the Mall parking lot and as we're in the middle of the parking lot, I stab her again and wake up.
