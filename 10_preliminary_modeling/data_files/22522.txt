I dreamt I was in a very big house with many rooms, and that I was doing the cleaning. But suddenly I saw a lady of advanced age who asked me a question. She asked me what my name was, and I told her my name. And she asked me why I was cleaning, since I was the daughter of the president and had so many servants to do that. I answered her that I did it because I liked it. Then I clearly saw how a cat went outside through a wall that had no holes in it. Seeing the cat get out with no problem, I wanted to do the same thing and wasn't able to. I bumped into the wall and at that moment I awoke.
