I dreamt about a colleague Juan. In the dream he was an artist doping some kind of commission or course. He was about to undertake a new large scale work. I was there as his tutor or advisor. My advice was not to hold back - to make something on a grand scale with real heart and soul and guts - not to be tentative - to be ambitious.
