Kaun's wheelchair is at the President's Corner. The Entertainment Center. Ellie can't remember the names of the streets there. I want her to get oil, but she's not very cooperative. I see children playing, and two soft cuddly dogs sit in the middle of a narrow street. I say, "They might get run over!" I go out and pick them up. They are cute and soft. Then I am smoking a cigarette and Steve looks at me surprised and pleased. He's smoking one too and we light each other's cigarette with our eyes meeting intensely. An instructor wants all of us to do our exercises and we aren't very cooperative. Noisy, not attentive. She's tired and annoyed. We have some games in the living room for each of us.
