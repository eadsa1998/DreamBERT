Am with some woman who I apparently know and we are walking to someone's apartment. Arriving there, we pass thru the garden and I note with pleasure the many tall seedlings in boxes and think I may see if I can get some for my house. We climb stairs and a man approaches. I ask for the apartment of Mr. Weiss. He nods consent and opens the door of a nearby apartment. As we walk in, the woman with me giggles and I look at her with distaste. Her profile is strange and I realize she is a stranger. The man who opened door seems to be a janitor or attendant of some sort, but he goes behind a counter and brings out some stamps for sale. Says he will find a nice set of the series I am looking for. I wait and then note he is completely wrong and the 4 or 5 stamps he has placed on the counter are completely different from anything I want and I have a suspicion he knows nothing about the stamps. Meanwhile, 5 or 6 homemakers and their children are standing near doorway and I note they are rather good-looking in an interesting way, and I have a strong desire to walk over and talk with them instead of having to explain to the janitor how wrong he is about the stamps. I am sure he will not understand and a hassle will develop.
