I am on a big motorcycle (probably a Harley Davidson). I am going down a highway and coming to a bridge. A man on a motorcycle is in the left lane and I feel like racing him so I speed up. He's pretty fast. Then I notice a racing course across the river and I turn right, off the highway and down to the wooden bridge with a break in the middle, for the motorcycle to jump. I rev up and go like hell, leaping over the expanse of water and then landing in the mud and sand trap set there to make the course really difficult. I squirrel around in the mud and sand cleverly, "riding" the ruts left there by other bikers. I am very successful and the head biker is watching with appreciation and interest. He wants to know who I am, so he starts to follow me. I ride away fast to try and lose him. I end up at the University, where I teach, get off the bike, and changed clothes real fast and go up to my classroom and teach. When I return to the bike, he and his biker cronies are there waiting for me to return so they can meet me and know who I am. I hide and listen in to their conversation. I am attracted to the head biker and finally reveal myself to him. We make love. It feels great.
