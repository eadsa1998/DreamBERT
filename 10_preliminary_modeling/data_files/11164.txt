The dream took place on a very wide street in a residential district. I was laying on a mattress with my head on a pillow perpendicular to the street. I was laying on a driveway from someone's house. There was a girl sitting next to me, but cannot recall who she was. My psychology professor lived two houses down from where I was. His automobile was parked in front of his home and at this time he was standing by the two of us carrying on a conversation. As I looked up from my pillow, I could see him smile at me. That was all I needed because I really had a mad crush on him. He offered me a few pretzels he had and before he offered the girl any, I gave her a 2 cent long pretzel since he had those thin ones. The professor was quite disturbed over this and started for home. Later I went to him and apologized for giving her a larger pretzel than what he had.
