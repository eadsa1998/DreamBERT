I'm in bed. I wake up with the ceiling leaking on my face in a steady stream. I get up and my parents come to look at the leak. I am explaining to them how I woke up with water pouring on my face. Then Shannon calls. I say, "Hey! I'm awake," and she says, "Ya, I know why, because of our main class." I say, "Ya, that too of course, but you'll never guess what happened. The ceiling is leaking right on my face." There is an ominous silence at her end and I realize I've offended her because my excitement over the class took second priority.
