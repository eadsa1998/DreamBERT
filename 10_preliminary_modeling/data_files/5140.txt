I have to pee really bad. I am in a house. Some man is injured and I am helping him. A cat is there somewhere, maybe also needing help. I go into a bathroom and try to sit on the toilet. It breaks off from the wall and is wobbly. I am standing and peeing so I won't tip it over. I pee voraciously all down my leg and around the room in front of me. I am concerned the water will back up and flow out of the toilet onto the floor. I leave. Now I am going from room to room in a hotel-like exhibit. I look out the window and see the beautiful emerald green ocean waves far below. There is a crowd of people walking through the exhibit as I am. I really need to pee and consider finding an exhibit toilet and using it. One room has a whirlpool and a single bed with an air mattress-like thing, sort of a health spa room. I wonder where people sleep and see another room with beds in it. I go out the door and go to the next exhibit room. On the way I see parrot beaded earrings and go over to see the price: 1 or 2 dollars, very cheap. I don't really want the parrots, but like crystal things or beaded things. [BL]
