["Storms on the horizon."] I am outdoors with Henry. He is looking behind me and comments on the many tornado funnel storms he sees on the horizon approaching us. I am looking behind him and say there are over five of them just below the horizon. You can't see them now. I am worried and fearful for the people caught out in the open when the storms arrive. The winds kick up. An object that looks like a string green bean lands on my arm with a slap. It sticks on my right arm and begins the damaging process. It is like a leech. Henry's wife grabs at it and pulls it off. It leaves a red open wound. She is relieved it was taken off quickly enough so that only minimal damage was done. She had saved my life. I begin to become sleepy and fall onto a bed (perhaps I was carried into the house.) Henry is seated next to me. As I become unconscious he pulls me up to him in a tender hug. I am healing and now that I am unconscious am relaxed about him holding me. I am peacefully allowing the embrace to be positive and healing.
