I was on some sort of a baseball team; a sport I don't care for and have only played twice when I was forced to in P.E. We were a bad team and always lost, though we hadn't really played any games yet. I didn't care if we won or not, but mostly I was concerned about the ball giving me a concussion. A very good team came to our field, but not for a game. One of them called out times of the day and then batted the ball where a clock would show it. For some reason two kids and I were trying to find a fence to put up somewhere, but we weren't successful at all. Setting: It was on a field I've not seen before, but sort of a combination of the school's and the one my brother's team plays at. Characters: There were mostly kids with a few coaches, our P.E. teacher from school was the assistant coach and the real coach was cruel. The kids on my team were a mishmash of grades, but were all from school. The two friends mentioned were in my grade. They were good friends of mine, but they really wanted to win as well as get the fence up. There were some kids on the other team from my school, but they were two grades above us at least. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, worried. I'm sort of curious if I'm going to enter a baseball team because I sure haven't been thinking about it!
