In the woods, like the Retreat Center, mountain climbing; it is dangerous, and I get lost; Back home I try to find someone to take care of Zena while we are on vacation; Neither our neighbor nor Marissa Camden can do it for me; so I decide that Zena can manage OK by herself. -- Later I see a PEACOCK with blue tail feathers, but when I pick it up it turns into our white bunny; I carry him downstairs and he bites my fingers hard and runs out into the snow.
