I was part of an experiment. Some ointment was spread over my body. It was a liquid. Some of it spilled on my nipples, and it appeared to be doing something harmful to the skin there. I told the doctor and he put a glass of orange juice to my lips. I said I didn't want the juice. I wanted him to attend to my skin. He left and a female nurse came and began squeezing oranges.
