I am at my mother's house which is a mess so I have to get dressed and shower in the car. My brother gets out and waits on the lawn until I am done. My mother is trying to strip cabinets in the house. My brother is helping. So am I. My husband comes and tries to tell us all how it should be done. I ask my brother where he is going. My brother spins out in the car and is killed. We are getting ready for the funeral and I am upset.
