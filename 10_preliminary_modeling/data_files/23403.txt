Sherry and I had another confrontation. I went to her house to get some things of mine (which she doesn't have) and at first it seemed things were okay, but then she started getting an attitude with me so I called her a bitch and starting walking away. She ran after me and starting yelling things. The rest is kind of vague, but I think at the end we were talking okay.
