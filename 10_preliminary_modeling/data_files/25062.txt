 I'm at a party in Buckingham and I think there may be a few people with me. On the porch I see a kid form Middleton College named Joe that I met on case day. He is sitting with another guy. There are some people in the house, but they are leaving pretty soon. The party clears out, and I see a guy with a brown and yellow Milton hat on. I want to go get my hat, which is exactly the same. Or, is this my hat? They guy gets in a blue van. Down the road, I see the van is wearing my hat! I want my hat back!
