I was at school with Danielle and we were talking about Angelo. We were waiting for Sineita and Angelo. We saw the bus turn up and we ran up to it but only Angelo came out. We asked him if Sineita was on the bus but he said no. Sineita turned up in the car and she didn't look right. When we were in class she was really angry and she did her work, but she wouldn't talk to anybody and she kept mumbling and giving us angry looks. I didn't know what we had done wrong. At recess I asked her what was wrong and she told us the whole story: "Last night when I was having dinner we had chicken, and Mom, Gemma and I were eating it but Gemma and Mom didn't eat they said it tasted funny and they only had a tiny bite and I had nearly eaten two pieces. The chicken had been poisoned and I had the most so I got sick." Sineita said. "I'm going to die!". She started crying. "The Royal Show is in two weeks and I'm going." she said. "But you won't be alive then." I said.
