I was working in a gas station where I worked 2 summers ago and a car pulled in. It was about a 1950 or 1952 Chevrolet wit a couple in it, husband and wife. People I've never seen before, about 35 years old. The car was burning up because the radiator didn't have water in it, so I remember I -- as is the case in gas stations, you open the hood and you very carefully loosen the radiator cap and elt the steam begin to escape. While I was doing this, the boss, for example, came over. He was talking to the couple. He asked what kidn of car is the best, if they wanted to buy a new one. I remember the wife and husband were kind of, well, it was something to the effect that the wife wanted to get a new car so she was kind of hinting to my boss and said that the new cars were very good and so forth and that they should buy one. Anyway, I remember the boss said that he wasn't too sure about these new cars because with the new range of mechanics that were coming out, they could fix up a Ford very well. They could fix up any other kind of car very well. Then he wasn't too sure which was the best. As I said, while this was going on, I had finally gotten the radiator cap off and the car was steaming quite a bit. I kept putting water in the radiator. I told them to let the engine idle as you should. Then very naturally as you're supposed to do in this dream, I also brought the hose inside the car and was watering off the dashboard.  This was supposed to help bring the temperature down and that was about the end of the dream.
