Jib came to me. I was looking for an Ann horse in the first at Sunshine. I was holding a spring that was to denote Ann, but it was short. I went into a store on 3. 72nd and Donald Avenue to get a press final, but it was not in, so I went outside to wait for the delivery. I had a couple of magazines and a racing form in between. I was turning the sheets to look into the form, but awoke. I had a horse picked for the 2nd at Sunshine, but I can't recall him now. I was in Gotche's backyard and was it loaded with flies. I had a fly swatter and I was swatting them on a board. They kept on lighting on the board and I swatted them. They were lying dead on the ground.
