A man and a woman want to make love and are looking for a place where they can be private. A man hides in closets and the woman goes from closet to closet looking for him. She sees a boy coming to the closet to hang up his hats. This bothers her because he'll find their closet and interrupt. He goes in and is now in his own room. Three puppets are hung up on the hat rack. He's afraid of one of them because it has huge black circles for eyes and looks scary. He calls to his daddy who says there's nothing to worry about. Then the two male puppets are moving and talking. One turns to the other and wants to make love, so the other one becomes a "female" and they have sex. I feel orgasm. A voice says, "That's OK, they are doing this because they are not really homosexual, they are both" (meaning bi-sexual). [BL]
