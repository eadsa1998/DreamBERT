The dream started off in the living room of a large mansion with four people whom I did not recognize standing looking at a package they had received in the mail. The package contained a music box inside of which was a calling card of a local undertaker. Suddenly we were aware that someone had been killed in the next room although we didn't see the body. A detective was called in to start the investigation in a typical Sherlock Holmes style. Everyone there was questioned including the undertaker who turns out to be a close friend of the family. After much thought the detective accuses the undertaker who in turn breaks down and confesses that business was so bad that he killed the person and then sent the music box as advertisement so the family would give him the business. The people in the room seemed to be my family but did not actually resemble my family in any way. The parents were about 40 years old and the daughter and son about 22. Even there was a feeling of some relationship. I still felt most of the time that I was merely a spectator.
