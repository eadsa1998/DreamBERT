I looked and saw trees broken off and the wind was blowing. One tree was burning. It was fanned by the wind and the bark burned very fast. A fruit stand was near and he closed up on account of the wind. Ann had a novelty skirt. She put it on and a penis stood up on the skirt. A girl had a school case. It was searched for some object that people thought was in it. Brother Steve and I looked it over and finally found a secret zipper compartment. I opened it and found a pencil, loose change and other objects. I looked into a small lake. There were a couple balls in it. I waded in to get one of them and the ball like magic moved out of my reach two times, so I let it alone.
