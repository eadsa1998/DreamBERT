 I'm driving east on 3rd Street just past Friends Avenue in Wilmerton. There is a building on the northeast corner of the intersection of Gallop Avenue and 3rd Street. In the windows are large copper colored pictures of old pennies. This is a campaign strategy: to get old buffalo or Indian images on the penny reinstated at the mint. I'm driving south to my friend Kevin Simpson's house. I seem to be in an alley. I stop when I near his house. I'm in back of his house, which faces west on the west side of the block. It's early morning. I was at his house yesterday, but am back for something. There are stacks of newspapers outside on the ground. Kevin delivers papers. There are stacks of large envelopes that have been sent via Federal Express to his door. The house is a single story with a basement and no deck. I have a key to the door. The door is solid gray and whitish with no windows. It is unlocked. I go in and yell hello. I don't expect Kevin to be here. I'm in the basement. Kevin's cat is there, and I call it to me. Urine from the cat starts to drip and stream from the ceiling. Kevin is then there. He yells at the cat, which stops it from urinating and scares it off. I realize he has a partner upstairs in bed. I ask him, and he tells me he doesn't know who she is or where she came from: a one-night stand. I realize that the person we're speaking of is male.
