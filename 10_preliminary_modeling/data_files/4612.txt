["Moral teachings."] I am visiting in some woman's house. The children are rambunctious and naughty. I am going from room to room trying to coral them telling them to settle down. Don't be so noisy and disruptive. They will not listen. I get into one room where a man is sleeping. He might be the physical therapist. I then see the owner of the house (like Anastasia's friend) who is seated in the garden next to a non blooming bed of roses. She tells me that when the roses bloom, they are poisonous and no one can rent this house until they stop. I am sympathetic on how hard that would be for the owner. I scurry around herding the children into the main room. They keep escaping. Some of their teen friends are on the patio and I ask them to leave. They refuse, laughing at me. I tell one boy I know his father. They reluctantly leave. Now it is time for the priest to instruct me on moral lessons and quiz me. I stand in the room as he lectures. He draws a multi-colored design or graphic on my right shoulder and when he asks me a question, I am to point to the right section. He asks me a series of what would you of if---questions. I have trouble answering. The correct names. But I can explain the basic answer. At one point, my Hawaiian dress is so loose, my breast flops out. I feel embarrassed and try to tuck them back in. Finally I answer all the questions and the lesson is over.
