I was looking at the results. I saw Frostberg won. One sheet had Bull or some other name, but I'm almost sure it was Bull. Then it gave the name of the farm it was owned by. I can't recall the other horses I saw results on. I was in bed with one of my daughters. We were under the covers and I was intimating her. I could not penetrate her. I put some saliva on my penis and then I penetrated a little, but my daughter yelled in pain. Her husband was in the room and didn't know what I was doing. I felt a little embarrassed, so I stopped. Then Audrey asked me if I had lettuce and I said, "Yes and I also have nice red tomatoes". She wanted to make a bacon lettuce and tomato sandwich.
