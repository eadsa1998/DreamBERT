We were at school and had sport. Mr Reilly was teaching us and he lagged and got there late. We had to wear a white shirt. I was getting changed and the shirt was too small. I was putting my Spongebob shirt on, and Mr Reilly was coming to I told him to stay away as I had no shirt on. I said I didn't have to play anyway because I had screwy knees. Everyone was on a huge basketball court. Alyssa and Rebekah were there. Then it was raining and Evelyn was next to me. Autumn was also there. I had been there for a while and I thought something was going to happen. It was then dark and this lady walked into the rain and started biting people and they turned into zombies. We ran and then were in a shop. I ended up with Eugene and some others. Calvin was there too. I was trying to call Mom on my phone and this guy saw me with it. She was in the area so was going to come and get me. The guy was going to take it and I started hitting him. I smashed a window with a water bottle to get out. I was walking down a street with some people and there was a baby, which had been killed and had a spanner in its head and there was blood everywhere. I went to the carpark and Mom came and I got in the car and I was trying to tell her what was happening. She was laughing about it. There were cars pulled over on the road. There was blood everywhere and zombies. They were blue and their arms were weird. Mom said "well, at least the roads are faster". I was wondering why I had left Eugene.
