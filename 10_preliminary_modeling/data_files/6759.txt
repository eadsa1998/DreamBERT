An old lady was visiting me. She was sitting under an outside stair landing. A small boy with a very big reddish bruise about eyes. Somebody comes to help me treat him. Squeezing papaya from a whole fruit on the wound. I am looking for my footstool to put on a new blue satin quilted pad on it. Person left liquid in a big jar blocking my stairway. I ask mama about it.
