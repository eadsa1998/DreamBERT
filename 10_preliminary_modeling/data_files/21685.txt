I was in the country. I saw two bulls and a small puny cow. One bull tried to mount the cow, but she always moved when he tried. I was watching them. Then the other bull tried to do the same, but didn't succeed. I was digging Frank Kogler's yard up. I dug into a treasure. It was a 2 lb. can full of pennies. I took a few of them and looked over a few of them to see if there were any Indian heads, but I didn't see any. I had the ground kind of piled up as I dug. I saw Kogler out of his house. I motioned to him I dug up his pennies. He made off as though he didn't' know of it, but then remembered. I was looking for a part-time job. There were coke ovens and I asked the man if I could draw one each day, but he made alibis that it was taken. I was on St. Clair Ave. Carl Fisher won a bowling trophy. A couple of couples came over and one of the young men bought an item from Carl and he was interested in the trophy. He asked Carl how much the trophy was worth and Carl said, "I will sell it to you for $8 and it is worth $17 or $18." The man didn't take it because he thought Carl would sell it for about $4.
