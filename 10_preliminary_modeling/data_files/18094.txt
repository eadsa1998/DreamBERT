We were in a hotel with me, my friend Kara, my mother and my father, and it was really big and it was like a free hotel, and you could rake leaves outside or play and do a garden. And you could like buy stuff next to it, because there was a railroad running right next to the hotel, so there was storage right next to the railroad. So we all went down to see, check out a store because they were selling shirts, and then we heard a really big rumbling noise, and it was really scary, so we all ran into the forest to hide. But it turned out to be a train, and that happened twice, so we all got really scared. But the third time my mother and my father were outside, and me and Kara were inside playing a game, and then all the power went out and we couldn't get out because the sliding doors used power, so we kicked down the glass and we got outside. And then we heard a really, really big rumbling noise and it was the train again, but it was going right for the hotel, and it wasn't really like on the track. So we all got our stuff and we got in the car and we went somewhere and we got lunch and then we drove home.
