I was reunited with all of my friends from years ago. [A lot of the friends I had when I was younger are having difficulties with police now.] Anyway we all were standing under a streetlight when something happened. I don't recall what, but the next thing I remember is my friend Paul and I were running through alleyways, jumping fences and climbing on the ladders that are attached to apartments. The police were chasing us and we were trying to escape. When we got on top of one of the roofs and the police were catching up, a door we needed to get in on top of the roof was locked. I ended up kicking the door in and after that we kept on running and a few seconds later I woke up.
