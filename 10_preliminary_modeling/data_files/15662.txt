Hugo was on the forum. He had been for a while, but we had never mentioned it. I sent him a message about something and when I was him at work next, he mentioned it, saying he had been too uncomfortable to bring it up and was glad that it was out in the open (or whatever). I laughed nervously and agreed (it was something irrelevant to anything, like a forum list). Then he suggested we go on a 'double date' or get something to eat or something and I was confused. Later, I was out with Mom at a shop. I felt sick and threw up a little bit.
