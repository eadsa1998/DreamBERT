Dad, Ezra, Jayson and I were sitting on this high scaffolding thing. We were all sitting on thin bits and kept almost falling off. We saw this hamster in a hamster ball and it fell off this cliff thing onto the road. Then it got run over. Dad and Ezra kept pretending to push me over, but I somehow stayed put. We then tried escaping but it was no use. I don't know how we got out but then we had to find some dead kid and get something out of him. We walked through this scary swamp and he was there. I had to light a match/lighter to go through him (he was a ghost though). We got the thing we were looking for. Dad had made me wear rubber boots. There was a flashback of something. Then we were in a puzzle room like Banjo Kazooie. The kid flew off and we had to jump into the picture to find him.
