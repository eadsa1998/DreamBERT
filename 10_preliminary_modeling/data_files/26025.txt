 I'm with my friend Kevin Simpson in the Big Resort Area. We canoe along. We're dragging a yellow minnow bucket. A black cat is right next to the minnow bucket. The cat drowns. We are swimming in the water, dragging the cat and the bucket. It seems we're on Little 15 Mile Lake, and we get lost again. He finds our orientation, and we head southeast, to make a loop in the time we have. We're using his Grumman canoe. There are two yellow canoes ahead of us that make it to the portage before us. We go past the Jordan portage to the Lora portage. It's 90 rods long. The water we cross is turbulent. I carry the canoe on the portage. The yoke is very close to the back of the canoe and my view is obstructed by the back seat. I say to Kevin that we forgot the bent-shaft paddles! A man at the portage tries to drag two aluminum canoes by putting the bows of each on each of his shoulders and driving his legs. I pass this man, running carrying our canoe, which is really light. We come to an open area. I am leading with the canoe. Kevin follows, with a younger kid and a man in his party. They want to take a photograph of me because I handle the Grumman like it's a feather, even running with it. I stop for them to take a photograph. The front of the canoe bends like I am carrying a carpet. The open space we've come to is a motor home park. There is a blacktop road, and open camping area, and some store areas. We walk in towards this tourist area. I see many northern pike that swim along the side of the road, where there is a four or five foot wall that drops down to the water level. I think we may be able to get some paddles here. Kevin asks about the amount of propane we have: he thinks we may not have enough. There are big ice cream cones in the tourist area.
