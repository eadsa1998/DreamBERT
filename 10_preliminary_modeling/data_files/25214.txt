 A person I know from high school, Lue Yang, has lived in our home for 9 years. I am in high school, and it is my sister Heather's birthday. My friend Edith Sherman is picking me up for school. In the car with Edith are my friends Tiny Combs and Annie Thomas. I need a hat, my gloves, and some cassette tapes. I go in the bathroom and fix my hair. Edith is waiting in the car, parked in the alley. I go outside. The ground is wet. I am wearing white socks. I realize I don't have shoes on, and so I stop, point to my feet, and go back in. Edith laughs at me. I am wearing the old black and pink jacket I wore in childhood.
