["Communicate with the man mentally."]  Two men are interested in me. They are courting me. I am not sure which one to choose. They both seem nice. The one more distant from me physically I see more. I seem to be more attracted to him. He mentally sends a group of people to come up to me and surround me. They stand very close all around me, as I am sitting. They stare at me. Somehow this is an extension of the man's mind as he learns about me. I begin to send mental signals back to him and actually start to feel what he feels and hear what he thinks. I realize I've had this capability for about a week. He is pleasantly surprised to discover I can now connect with him telepathically. I choose him and move through the people to sit next to him. We are happy.
