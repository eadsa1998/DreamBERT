 I'm at an Armstrong High School basketball game. The men's team is playing the women's team. It's a sloppy game. The men easily overpower the women, but they try to show off, and they make many errors, turnovers. I sit behind the men's bench on a big track and field mattress. I shake hands with my old teammate Larry Rollie, who is in uniform on the bench. I think coach Shooter must be letting the others play, not putting Larry in yet because then it will be a blowout. I wonder where my old teammate Shawn Salzburg is, wonder if he's on the court. I laugh out loud and comment openly about the play of the teams. I then realize that my laughs and comments may not be appreciated because I'm an alumnus, and am frowned upon. There is a small crowd gathered for the game. Some of my aunts are among the people there. The game ends at the end of the first quarter because it is sloppy. The men's team is crushing the women's team, and it is pointless to play because it's such poor play.
