Programming my car and maybe other cars to help us get where we want to go the best or most effective way. The images of the dream though were those of creating a document in MS Publisher where you can flow text from one page to the next within text boxes. When I programmed the car it affected how something flowed from page to page. I was trying again to successfully program my car so then we could use that as a guide to help other people program their cars successfully.
