I dreamt again about the teeth.  This time only the front.  The top two teeth came out.  I tried putting them back in.  I did so backwards, however.  They alternated a very yellow color with their normal when I looked in the mirror.  The one on the bottom left came out while I was putting the teeth back in the right spots.  I don't think I was quite as anxious about the whole situation this time, for some reason.
