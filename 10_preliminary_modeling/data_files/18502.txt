I was working in a bullpen doing marker comps and my teacher, Mr. Raymonds, was working too. I had been working already 7 hours but most of that time was (wasted) because I was screwing things up and it was taking me much longer than it should have. First there was a comp to xerox on acetate and it had black writing and I was suppose to copy it onto a lined envelope (pale icky green heavy lined (as in paper lining, not lines) with yellow ochre crepe paper and the texture of the crepe paper made it very hard to xerox onto, especially with the acetate. I kept screwing it up and I was getting behind so I thought I should at least look like I was working on problems. I decided to work on the computer and when I double clicked a monster came on. He was sort of like Dracula with a wide open mouth. I double clicked [again] and he just got bigger every time. Then a ghost came up and he kept getting bigger too. And then I was trying to do the accordion folds and I did NOT need to glue the pages back to back like I thought I did. The teacher said, "Why don't you take a break, the marker fumes are getting to you." Jasmine came to pick me up and she was on her way to volunteer for a political campaign. We stopped at a restaurant and her friend was leaning against a wall at an angle. The waitress brought a thick, thick pizza cut in half only and my half fell upside down on the table. The man walking in the duck suit looked stupid. Jasmine went to the car and she forgot her Bible. She also forgot her fingernail file and architect's tube. I tried to put the pizza in a box that was too small because I knew she'd be hungry. I left too. I had to finish my comp and she had to work in the darkroom until daylight.
