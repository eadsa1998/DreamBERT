Carol Creedom (a friend from University days in psychology). She lives on the highest floor of a building: view at sunset time, ideal for sketching. I see figures half in black and half in sunshine; see U.S. flag bathed in light. I am looking up. Jonathan (Frank's intellectual friend) is there sketching. Later am walking with John through wild countryside, mountains, green and brown meadows and some waterfalls.
