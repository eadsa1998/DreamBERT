Soft piano music with a string orchestra in the background. Autumn leaves fall around the road in a crisp wind. The sun is angling through the trees, casting a gold glow over everything. The massive RV has a large empty space in the middle, and everybody is laying around under blankets inside. The RV is slowing to a halt. It's clear our journey is coming to an end. It is my job to distribute the magazines. I give one to Laura and set one aside for myself. There are two other people I don't know in the RV, and I give them their magazines. I approach Kermit the Frog, who takes a copy of People, and thanks me profusely. I go up to the driver's cockpit as Dr. Teeth (who has been driving) brings the RV to the side of the road. I show him what we have left: Country Living and the Jarvis Catalogue. "Oh yeah man, thanks, just what I need, alright, absotively, possolutely!" He takes them and I retire to my blankets in the back of the RV with my magazine, as the piano music slows and quiets down. I drift slowly out of the dream, feeling very warm and content, thinking: Ah, what a nice dream. It takes me at least ten minutes to begin laughing.
