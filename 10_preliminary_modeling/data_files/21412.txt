Some man put his arms around Ann and he was going to turn around her. I commanded him to let her go, but he held on, so I started to punch him. He let Ann go and I handled him although he was bigger than me. He finally gave up when I banged his legs and bottom on the pavement by whipping his body and hitting his legs and body on the ground. After the surrender, he got up and his wife was standing beside him. He was a big man. My shoulder reached his solar plexus. I showed him what I would do. I gave him light punches in the solar plexus. We were up on a cliff. There was an accident or something below. Ann went down and I was sitting on top of something, just had a grip with my fingers just ready to slide down and get killed or hurt. I pulled myself away from the edge and then walked down to where Ann was. It seemed there was a casket and a woman had her husband there. Carter was at our house and he asked for a drink. Ann said, "That's all you want when you come here." I heard someone go out the kitchen door from the house. I ran to the door, put on the light and yelled to Carter for backing. I was going to go out to see who it was. When I opened the door, brother Steve was standing there. He said, "Maybe you better give up drinking and come over to see us once in a while." I said, "It's not the drinking that's keeping me away. It's on account of Ann doesn't like skinny, that's why she doesn't like to see you folks." I was in the basement and some friend was acting tough with me. I finally got fed up and I put him in his place. I made him do what I wanted him to. I had a lot of water leaks in my pipes which were old. I looked at them and thought, "I will have to start buying new joints and replacing the old ones, little by little. I was in the field catching a baseball when someone hit it out. I was missing them all.
