First it was a movie with Ben Mendelsohn, but then it was me, two guys and a girl. We went to this place which had been taken over by aliens and it was like Invasion of the Body Snatchers. We went there to infiltrate. We were welcomed by this lady and taken to a building with lots of storeys. We were all taken to separate floors, which I was annoyed about because I wanted either a friend or this guy I liked with me. There was a lady at the desk and the place was full of people. It was also dark as there were no lights. She gave me this thing that was a little bit bigger than a computer mouse to hold. It also went over the top of my hand and she started it up and it got tighter and then there was a little prick, which was going to alter me, but we had gone through stuff so that although we would change physically, we wouldn't be under their control mentally. I pretended to fall to the ground and sleep and they were happy that they had a human. I got up eventually and asked to visit my friend. I went to walk up the stairs and it was really dark. I saw glowing eyes and it was breathing heavily and I was like 'hello?' and it went after me -- it was a rhino. Everyone started running and I ran up the stairs and I got to a floor with a balcony outside a window. I jumped through the window and ran down the stairs. I climbed up a little tree and I thought it was going to break. The guy I liked was in a bigger tree near mine. The rhino eventually left and I got down. I found cards of everyone and the animal/thing they would turn into. It was based on either things like hair colour or shape of their face etc. Samantha had yellowish brown hair and she turned into a snake of the same colour. Dawson (Dawson's Creek) had one and his was a tree. Some of them were quite funny. I told one of my guy friends that I thought the girl had changed and was under their control.
