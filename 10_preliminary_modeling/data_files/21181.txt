I saw there was a name of a horse. I played 3 horses and two of them came in. I forgot the names. I was in school listening to recitations. I was going to sit in a seat, but a colored boy sat there and I went to the back row. There was a deep drop there in back of the last row and I was careful not to fall off. Someone asked me who I played. I said Hoosier Boy.
