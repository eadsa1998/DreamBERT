We threw large rocks on a goose, then I grabbed it by the neck and my friend slit his throat and blood oozed out. The watchman came out, so I grabbed the goose and was taking it home. I was locking the windows and doors so no burglars would come in. The window was hard to shut. It seemed to be sprung a bit.
