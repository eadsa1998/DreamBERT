I remember in this dream going to the tennis courts with my friend, but I do not remember playing tennis. The next thing I knew we were in a building with many people and we were holding our tennis raquets. I met my husband and we began to talk, when one of my professors approached us and appeared quite friendly and interested in my school work.  He discussed my last paper with me and then we went into his offlce for a conference. I remember seeing three people leaving his office. He told me my grade which I was satisfied with, but he criticized my work in a beligerent manner and this made me quite unhappy. But I had the feeling, nonetheless, that he was pleased with my work.
