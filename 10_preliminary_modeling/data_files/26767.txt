 I'm fishing with my dad in a shallow area, almost shoreline. There are weeds, lily pads, logs, and stumps around. My dad says the area is no good for fishing: it's too thick. I want to try it out more. I drop my line in a small open pool, after climbing up onto dead fallen logs and stumps. I'm alone. I have a fly rod with a sinking moth-like fly. The small area I'm in seems to have barriers in front of it. There are sunfish in the water below. I dangle the line in front of them. A few fish nip at the lure. I try, but don't hook any. A large fish swims in front of me, from my right to left. It looks like a huge trout! I dangle the fly in front of it but it doesn't bite. The fish turns and swims past me on my left side. There is a band behind me. The fish swims towards it, there is no water there. I see the fish is then an animal with four legs, each about two feet long. It is wrapped in blue plastic wrap and has a rubber band around part of it. I pick it up by its hind legs. I'm afraid of it biting or scratching me. I swing it, whacking it against a large sink six or nine times. It's now dead. After this incident where I beat the animal to death a sketchy evening news team pursues me because of my behavior. A woman with a microphone hounds me. I don't reply. I go to my truck, get in, lock the passenger door, and drive away. I may have the dead animal with me.
