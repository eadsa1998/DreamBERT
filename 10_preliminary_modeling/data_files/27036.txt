We were eating at the dormitory, but instead of the housemother, my teacher from grade school (5-8 grades) was there. His son, a member of our young people's group at home and several other members of that group were also there. It was a large dinner. Chicken and spaghetti are the only two things I remember specifically, but there was much more. I had Just started to eat when I got up to get something for another girl. When I returned the waitress had taken my plate. I was very angry that the other girls hadn't prevented this, but was able to get more food. There was more to the dream but I can't remember it.
