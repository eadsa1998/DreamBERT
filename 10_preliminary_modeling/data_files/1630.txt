I am at an island where I've gone to lead a quiet, peaceful life. Someone told me to do it. It looks a little boring. Then I am crawling back from a work day of picking up fruits, and I'm dragging myself and the fruits down a muddy road. I'm exhausted. I look to my left and see waves and realize that a tidal wave is coming in. I go to the house to get Howard so we can drive to safety. Then it's over and I see the muddy ground. I want to leave the island and return to my normal life.
