I'm standing in a church. Dozens of clones of Matt (a friend) are being gunned down in cold blood by machine gun fire. I hide under a pew when the gunfire starts. I see the clones' heads being blown off, etc. Somehow I knew that the situation outside was really crappy, and that even if I did make it out alive, living would be a highly questionable alternative to dying. Whatever the situation was, it was probably better to be dead than to be crawling around half-dead, running for my life. Besides, I figured, there were two other things about dying: First of all, if I got myself killed just then, and death turned out to be nothing, then great. At least I wouldn't be in agony; at least the torturers couldn't get me too. Second, if death turned out any other way, than equally great, because then I'd be out of this crappy situation and in some other state of affairs. On this thought, I stood up and had my body ripped through by machine-gun fire. After I died, I found myself in a room with two beautiful, naked women, one brunette, one blonde. And Matt. I have sex with the blonde woman for a while, and then we stop to invite the brunette. She can't. She points over at a hallway. She explains that she needs to go get her womb, or her ovaries, or her 'placenta' -- I remember it was some part of the reproductive system, or the placenta; I don't know whether this latter was supposed to be her own or her baby's -- but every time she goes into the hallway, Matt shoots her to death and she has to start all over again. So she never goes to get 'it', and she never joins me and the blonde.
