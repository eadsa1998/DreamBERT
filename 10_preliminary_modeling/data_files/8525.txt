I was at the office with Jennifer C and someone else, I think a friend of hers. There was some kind of bustle going on but I can't decide if it's other people, maybe her children there, or if there is something going on. She decided to quit but was not giving us any notice. Her husband was being transferred so her and their children had to move immediately. She didn't even seem to feel bad that she wasn't giving us any notice. I was trying not to be upset about this, but to instead be understanding. I think she may have asked her sister if she could cover for her at our office until we found someone else.
