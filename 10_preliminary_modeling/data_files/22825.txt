I am at church camp.  There is a river nearby.  One of the boys is taking a motorboat load of kids up and down the river, and some (including me) are swimming in the river.  I am careful to have someone hold my watch while I swim.  On the way back from camp, Mr. Welborn is driving, and Johnny Barrett, a WTIZ disc jockey, is in the back seat.  There is a WTIZ car just in front.  When we pass it, we wave, but they do not recognize any of us, even Barrett.  As we start to go over a bridge, Mr. Welborn starts to pass a car on the right which is already in the right hand lane.  As we get on the bridge, we sideswipe a post and have to swerve back, smashing a fender, but he does not stop.  In the middle of the bridge, he tries to pass on the right again.  This time there is no railing, and we go off into the river, which is only about a foot or so below the level of the bridge.  I kick off my shoes and socks and tread water until I can reach the bridge and hang on.  Everyone else gets out of the car, too, and the car sinks to the bottom.  While I hang on the edge of the bridge, a reporter comes up, kneels down, and begins asking questions.  He also asks about my hitting a girl named Denise with the car and killing her.  This makes me very mad, and I deny it vehemently because it seems I have heard this accusation repeatedly in this dream.
