It was at our coming convention (I am running for president of our organization). I could see the crowded convention room, dimmed with smoke. I had been furiously taking minutes (I'm secretary) &amp; had got up to speak on a topic that concerned me--I don't know what it was, but I was passionately sure they were all wrong--I got up to talk, feeling dizzy &amp; tired, but made my point &amp; went out for air, feeling utterly exhausted &amp; beyond caring if the convention took my advice or not. One of the boys was outside--someone I'd met before--I was almost in hysterics by then &amp; shaking--he took me in his arms and held me, then we sat down &amp; I leaned on his shoulder &amp; after awhile he kissed me gently. By then, feeling very tranquil, I went back to take minutes again. As I was coming back, the uproar hit me like a blow, &amp; as I went in, I heard two of the boys talking about me. "Should we vote for her?" one of them asked, &amp; the other answered, "I don't like her as a person, but she's got brains--I think I'll support her. I wonder if she's human, tho--cold as a fish." I tried to pretend I didn't care, &amp; forced myself to go back to my place.
