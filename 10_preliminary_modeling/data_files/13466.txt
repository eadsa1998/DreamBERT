I was at a shop. People from school were standing in a circle throwing a ball. Calvin and Samantha were next to me and Chriss was next to Samantha. It got to a couple of us. Chriss had thrown a ball at me earlier and I caught it, but thought he was Eugene. Ezra and I were then playing a live Popomundo and we had to walk around and "be the hits of 1973+". Mom was getting us Baskins &amp; Robbins and I got choc chip cookie dough.
