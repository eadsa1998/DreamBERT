 I'm going to baby-sit at the house which is second on the right as one walks north on Home Avenue from it's intersection with 2nd Street in Oak Valley. I arrive at the house. The woman is preparing to leave. She has two kids: A male infant and a 3 year old. She tells me I should put on my red pajama suit. I remember she told me earlier to bring a red pajama suit to wear. I tell her I forgot it, and then say that I don't have a red pajama suit. Coincidentally, I am wearing a red long-sleeved thermal shirt. She says she'll go find me some pants. She doesn't seem happy that I forgot a red pajama suit. She directs me to the bathroom with the pants and tells me to change. I go into the room I think she pointed to, but it's the kitchen. It is very crowded and cramped, with hardly any walking space between appliances. I squeeze through into what I think must be the bathroom. I have trouble changing clothes. I can't put the red pants on the outside: they are under my other pants, which seem like rain gear. Finally, I get the red pants on the outside. The woman's friends arrive. It's time for her to leave. Her friends ask me a few superficial questions about school. I am back, then, after some time. The infant and child are asleep. The infant stirs and whimpers. The kids must have put themselves to bed, or the child put the infant to bed. I pick up the infant when he starts crying. I calm the baby. I may drop the baby, but not all at once. The baby is on the ground.
