["Michael B."] I see Michael B. seated on the left arm of an easy chair. I am attracted to him. I sit on the right arm. I try and chat with him, trying to appear casual. I am thin and young. I wear jeans and a pretty blue short sleeved T-shirt. He chuckles and says Hey, all you need are dairy boots. I say, Oh, I have them. he is amused. I say, yes, my relatives used to own a dairy farm in T City. He says patronizingly, but friendly, So did you get to watch them milk the cows? I say Yeh and I got to milk them too. And chase them around. I seemed important to me to show how active I was in the process. I was trying to impress him.
