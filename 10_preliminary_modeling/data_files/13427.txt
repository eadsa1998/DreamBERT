I was writing my novel except it was different. It was playing out live. Calvin and I were running in a forest. Eugene and Bradley were near some flower. Evelyn was off by herself. For some reason I kept thinking she was going to die of a kidney problem, but she got shot. In real life, Evelyn died and the police were questioning me. I was in this room which had a shower. Calvin was there too and we were trying to escape through the window.
