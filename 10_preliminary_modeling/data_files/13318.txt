Mom had a new house. My room had no walls; they were all mesh-y. My website was different and private. It was actually my room. I decided to wear twenty different pieces of clothing. I had a glove thing on, undies, board shorts, a sock and a bra and was about to put a shirt on when Will Arnett looked in and I shooed him out. Then Mom came in and wouldn't let me close the door. She put a baby in and then I was going to kill it. I punched some kid after he punched me. Later, people were climbing up the walls to get into my room. I was pulling them down. There were lots and I grabbed a girl and she fell and hit her head so I did that to the others. Then I gave up. Later I was at some school thing. Ramona gave me a card we needed. People had sheets that they'd printed from my site. Mathias was there and he had a picture and a cartoon. There was something about Gavin. Ramona had a dream that I'd had about Eugene. I was trying to find him. I was thinking that Ramona was like Calvin and Tiana was like Evelyn.
