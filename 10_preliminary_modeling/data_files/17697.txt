I dreamt of a sort of paintball mission.  My boyfriend Jeremy and I were in a group and prepped to shoot the 'insane aliens'.  You could tell they were insane when they turned orange.  The first two areas were clear, with only sane aliens.  They looked sort of like speckled head crabs from Half-Life when sane.  The third area had an insane one.  We were driven to the site in a Jeep, and I was sitting next to a girl.  We grabbed the same gun sitting between us, and then grabbed each other's.  Mine had more paint in it.  I didn't care, though, and took hers and approached.  I shot the alien and returned to the car.  The girl was upset that I didn't give anyone else a chance, but I was just doing as ordered- it wasn't just a game.
