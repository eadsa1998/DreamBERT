I think it was Matthew and I moving back to Lakeland Dr. I think I went to the owners of the home we used to own there and asked them if I could go in and look around. We went in and I was amazed at all the changes. They had gotten rid of the laundry room and the large deck we had built on the back. They had also put in a basement. I don't know how you add a basement to an existing house. For some reason the neighbors didn't want to accept me. the neighborhood seemed very nice, just as it was in waking life. At another point it seemed like it was very rundown and dangerous. At another point in seemed almost cartoonish in things that were in the street etc. At another point I was either a part of family that lived there or maybe a friend or simply an observer. The adult male in the family was prone to violence. The family members often tried to avoid him or hide from him when they felt he was dangerous. For some reason I didn't shy away from him. I seemed to be the one that was able to manage him and help him through his anger without hurting anyone.
