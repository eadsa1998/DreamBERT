I was at my cabin up north with my mom, dad, brother (22), me (19), and a friend (18). My parents decided they didn't like my friend. So they threw her on the fire and chopped off her head. I'd say my dream was very unpleasant. Then my parents decided to chase me and my brother around the island. Then the scene switched to me being on a bus filled with kids. The bus driver started saying that my brother was arrested for driving his car.
