 I'm in Meyers Hall at Brimson. My classmate Jackie Hunter is there with some friends of hers. It is early in the evening. My friend Kevin Simpson, roommate Stephen Ramos, and others may be there. I try to talk to Jackie and her friends, trying to strike up a conversation. She doesn't say anything back. Her friend says, "Bobby is sometimes hard to talk to." Her friend is referring to Jackie. Jackie smiles when her friend says this, and she looks at her friend. It is nighttime. We walk down to the corner of Brighton and High Avenues. Jackie turns left and goes east down High Avenue. We walk across Brighton. Kevin hits on one of Jackie's friends.
