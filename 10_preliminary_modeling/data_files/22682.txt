I was going to a church where my mother had made an appointment for my wedding. I went in with a little girl who was with me and there was a big wedding with a reception going on. We were standing by the door when a German police dog came out running to the street. Then came other dogs, which were its litter and they climbed over me and they bit me because they thought that I had let their mother escape. And I had to defend the little girl who was with me and who was very scared and crying. My fear was that the dogs would corner me and bite me, and I had to lift the girl so that they wouldn't get her. Afterwards I dreamt something which I don't remember, but I was in the car with Armand and we were talking about the cardinal's ring.
