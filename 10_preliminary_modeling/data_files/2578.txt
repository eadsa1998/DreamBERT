I am at work/school and tired. I want to go home and look around to see if things are done. I notice that I haven't finished my work for the day. There are clothes to be folded and put away. I sigh and go get it done. I separate the skirts, the underslips and the tops into different piles. I find pieces of a dress pattern pinned to a cork board at the bottom of the laundry pile. I start to take the pin out and put the pattern away, but can't remember if the person making the dress has cut the cloth yet. So I leave it, just in case. I now feel ready to go and can't find my purse. A young man walks in and I abruptly ask him what he wants. I realize a class will be coming in soon. Ellie is hanging around not being helpful. I can't find my car keys and I see more clothes to put away. I feel tired and frustrated. I remember the purse is in the closets among more piles of clothes. Dream work: bars of jail and bars (as in taverns) and bars of music long (horror?) jail could be coffin, the living dead. "Let me out" appears in both titles!
