I was in school and there was this project that students could work on. It was like basically an aquarium with the Little Mermaid stuff in it, and it had to get permission to be out of class for like two days a week for the rest of the semester to work on it. And I dreamt that I got it online and I got two of the raw materials to do it. I got the stand and the top, and the aquarium itself was going to be in a teapot and I got that. And I set it on the counter ready to go, and I, all of a sudden I was in this reception hall with my system, Peavey system set up and I was adjusting the faders so somebody could talk on the microphone as they wished and it wouldn't feed back. [laugh] And I couldn't remember who was talking on it or what they said, but they were walking around pretty good and I was real nervous they were going to go over too close to the speakers and make it feed back, and then I would be blamed for it. And I do remember there was a guy next to me which I was adjusting the equalizer, well, while the person was talking on the microphone I started a Kenny D CD playing, and the EQ just sounded terrible, so I was sitting there adjusting it. And I was telling this guy that was sitting there that I keep my hand on the microphone fader so that if it starts to feed, I can just bring it down immediately. And I remember then we were starting to pack it up, and for some reason I realized I was naked. And I was putting all the stuff back in the boxes. I only put one of the speakers on top of the Peavey box and Dad was already hauling it out to the truck and there was another stand standing freely. Then I don't remember what happened, and then I woke up.
