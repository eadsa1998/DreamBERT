Marty came up to me. He said his brother-in-law was getting $206. He had a two-horse reverse, some slinger or swinger and I can't recall the other horse. Then he gave me a $20 bill and a $3 bill. I said, "This is no good. There is no $3 bill," and it was torn in half. There were two salt shakers or something like them which stood for $2. I put them in my pocket. We bought a new Pontiac. The paint job was bad. It was rough and a little pitted. I looked it over closely. I was driving it around. When Marty came up to me, he gave me a sack cloth bag with the money in it. There was loose change and bills. Then he took the bag or sack back and he gave me the money I mentioned before. I made a jump, and was going to beat someone on a big jump. He was looking for a place to make the jump. When I was driving the new Pontiac, I noticed the two front side doors were vibrating or loose. I pushed them and they were not caught on the latch. They were like swinging doors.
