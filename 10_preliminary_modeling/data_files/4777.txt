Charla and I are walking down a hall. We are looking for a table to sit at. I walk past a man who I don't trust. I choose to go around the corner and find a table away from him. I put my papers and things on the table. The man is at a slightly higher level and looking down at our table. He makes me nervous. I am afraid he will take my things. I guard them closely and warn Charla to guard as well. Then I decide to walk to Grandma Anne's house and stay there. We walk toward it but I change my mind and return to the table. The man grins at me and tries to sit at the table with me. I say to him, sharply, stay away. I don't want you near here. I scoop up my papers and hold them close to me. I am also worried he will steal my money. He keeps annoying and taunting me. He says if you don't like it, you can leave. I start to get up to leave. He's right. I don't have to be close by. Then I get an idea. I have a new digital way of producing things that recording companies could use. I could make money. But this man owns the company in Texas (where we are.) I decide there are other companies!! ."
