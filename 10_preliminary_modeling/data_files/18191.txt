The dream concerned the woman who lives next door to us who is, I would say, is in her early or middle 50's, and we were standing around talking to someone else who lived on the other side of her, or talking about those people to someone else, and I was saying that there was something funny about both of these people -- the woman who lives right next door and then this person who lived one apartment further down. But the woman who lived right next door was the one that there was something really strange wrong with her, and that she was some sort of psychotic, even though she seemed very nice, but there was still something very strange wrong with her.
