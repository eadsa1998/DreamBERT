 I'm at a swimming pool playing with a ball with my brother Wally. We throw the ball and dive in to get it. I dive and hit my head on the cement. I die. I float up out of my body. Everything is black and I feel tingly. I say no, I'm not ready to die; I have time left. I go back into my body, but it is five months later. I'm in a cemetery. My friend Tom Napper is there and I tell him to go away. I drive a car out of the cemetery. My classmate Amy Leopard is there. I drive out of the cemetery. I recommend Frosted Flakes to an office man.
