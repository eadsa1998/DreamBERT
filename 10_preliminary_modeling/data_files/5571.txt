[1997-05-22] It was afternoon and we were at work ands I was in an office talking to a couple of teachers. One rehab teacher who doesn't always see things the way I do, someone who is not as understanding as I wish she could be sometimes with our clients. I am always frustrated with her because of this. I was frustrated in the dream as well. They were in their office, all talking and not really working very hard and others were there too. Her assistant came in and said "I'm going to watch TV." She had a TV on near her desk. I was standing in the doorway, about 2PM and she went over to her desk on the opposite side of the wall. The teacher I was trying to talk to was nearer to me. I thought it would probably be a good idea for me to leave the room because I didn't want to get caught watching TV or even being a room with a TV even though I wasn't going to be listening to it or watching it so I didn't stay very long.
