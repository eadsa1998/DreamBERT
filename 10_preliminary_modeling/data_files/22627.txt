This was a long dream: A cousin of mine was getting married, but she looked like an aunt on my mother's side of the family. She lived in the building that was across the street from where I live now. She was not marrying her fianc√©. In the dream she was already married, but she was marrying someone else and was giving a big party in that building. Her mother called me at work to tell me that she was very angry with her daughter for not having made the reception at their elegant residence. She thought that she could not take her fancy friends and relations to "that building," and was ashamed to do it. In short, neither my aunt nor my uncle attended the party. I, on the contrary, fixed myself up very nicely to attend it. I put on make-up so I would look nice. I went, I talked to her, I ate, I danced, but I was very worried because my sister had asked me to take care of her two-year-old daughter while she went to the party, and I had left her all alone, playing with another little kid whom I cannot identify, so that I kept going across the street to my house to see how she was. I remember well that I couldn't go to the ceremony because I was working, and that in order to save time I had gone to work in the party dress, to go straight to the party from work. I had situated work in the block next to my cousin's place, and therefore very close to my own house. But I had put on my dress without putting on make-up, and that upset me so much that I wasn't calm until I found a chance to put make-up on. I saw my cousin, dressed in white, at the moment she came into her house, surrounded by people. I was asking her why she had married another man. Among the guests was her ex-husband who, naturally, was in his own home. I also remember that I was desperate when I was trying to amuse my sister's daughter, and I was missing the party, and she would run away from me, and I would have to chase her and bring her back by the hand.
