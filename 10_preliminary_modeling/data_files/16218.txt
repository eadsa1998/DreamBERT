I was watching this documentary that I had taped on TV, like this news program or something, and it was Celine Dion at her computer going through some MIDI files on her website and Rene-Charles, her baby, was on her lap, and she was explaining to the viewing audience which songs that Rene liked and which ones made him nervous and put him on edge, and which ones he liked. And then as the story went along, it showed him in this, Rene and this car and him getting in this major fiery accident. And [sigh] then it showed him like three or four all of a sudden, trying to fight somebody and somebody was trying to attack him as the ambulance was coming. And he was like, "I'm three years old and I know how to use a knife. I can take a sparkler and I can burn you." And I don't remember exactly what happened. I was like rewinding the tape and it was like playing it over and over again, and that was weird. And then the phone rang and woke me up.
