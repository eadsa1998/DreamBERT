I downloaded some program for university which could download information into your brain. I picked something for ANS about geese and Afrikaans -- I saw images and subtitles. Mom didn't believe me when I told her about it. Then I was at university, which was different. I went to the toilet and passed Samantha on the way. There were two open cubicles. I went into one of them and it said you could only be in there for a maximum of 2 minutes. There was a girl in another one. I finished before her and then she came out and asked if there was anyone outside. She said her mother or grandma had died and everyone was bothering her about it. There was a big TV somewhere and people were playing a game. There was a computer room nearby which had a TV for people to play Guitar Hero.
