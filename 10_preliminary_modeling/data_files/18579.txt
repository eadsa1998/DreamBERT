I was taking a very difficult class in a deep, deep basement, far underground. It was 7 stories below street level and it was dark, but lights glowed enough. The first part of the test was scanning items on a grocery store scanner and bagging the fruit yourself. On this part I didn't do so good. Then we had to do extensive research. My research topic was to find out if the Kellogg's company actually did have any authentic formulas for their cereals, or if they had simply stolen the formulas many years ago from a small middle eastern country where English was not spoken. The man who wrote the textbook for this class had died many years before. I found a locked, buried box. In cement while investigating. Inside were copies for 2 long papers and an open text, bound, that said it belonged to Kellogg's. ???. Last was a Grade Point Average list. The papers--one belonged to a girl whose last name was Rosen and the other girl, last name Lyme. The note said, "Rosen and Lyme, GPA 4.2. You girls really did your research." Their research was about poisons. After this date (date on note) the teacher died. The girls hated him so bad they poisoned him. He, of course, knew this, but had been so impressed with their research that he went right along with the plot and was quite aware they were killing him. The general public did not know about the murder till many years later. A yellowed newspaper article, very small, told, "Rosen and Lyme, Convicted." Though they had killed--were in the process of killing the teacher because he worked them so hard; he was extremely proud of their diligence. By the time I found all this out the subway platform was deserted. I was the last one there and it was late at night. The train station in Harlem would be very deserted and it could very well be me this time!
