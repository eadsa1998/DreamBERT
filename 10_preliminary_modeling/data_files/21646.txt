Ann came home from work and she said she was going back in about 4 hours. I said it was up to her if she wanted to go. I walked into a church. I never saw such a big church. It had so many confessionals. I was carrying some object in my hands and I just wanted to pray, but there were so many people sitting in the rear of the church going to confession. I walked way to the left side, then finally sat down. Here I was with Ann, Joe O'Corn and Francis O'Corn. They were brother and sister, but in the dream they were husband and wife. Ann asked me if I would take her out that night and I said I wouldn't because she was tired. She got stubborn and said, "Then I will go out with Joe O'Corn. Joe kind of blushed, but was willing. Francis whispered something into his ear and I know it was, "You better not go with Ann." She didn't want Joe to go with her. I told Ann what an old fool she was, going out with a teenager. She was really nuts. I was cleaning off a parked truck. I had to clean something on it, yet where I have to move the truck. So I gave it a little push and tried to stop it by holding it back, but it rolled over a little bump and ran into the side of another truck parking in the garage. The boss came over, said, "That fool didn't have his brake on when he parked the car." He was turning some kind of spinning shiny object that was on the truck. My sister Ann asked me if she could read one of my books. I said sure. I was working down in the flats. I came in and there were workers taking the machines apart. I was putting bars on a rack and it was too far apart. I had to move the stand closer. Mitchkash (deceased) was with me. Cecilia came over and talked to me. I put a blanket over and around myself and went into the locker room to get my clothes and the floor was all covered with tools and machine parts. I looked into the lockers and they were empty.
