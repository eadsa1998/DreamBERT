Darren was taking this animal from Mom's and I wasn't allowed to tell her. Darren had a Ute and me and two guys were in the back of it. Something happened and I got knocked off. I was holding on, and then I fell. I got back on. Somehow our heads changed. Mine was a mushroom, and one dude's was an ear. We did whatever we had done a second time, but our heads just went bigger. I went to school. There was a pool thing with waves. A beaver was following me. My head shrunk back to normal over time. I lost my pants. Mr Norris was at a library. The beaver turned into an annoying person. I snuck up and scared him. The beaver dude was dancing.
