I am to be married at a RURAL WEDDING: first I am to be the bride of an older man, but I don't like him; Then someone suggests I marry a 9-YEAR OLD GIRL. I take off Edward's Wedding ring and am about to stand up with the girl, When it all DISSOLVES. I think to myself, "This is ridiculous, a 9-year old girl marrying a 40 year old woman." So the wedding does not take place. I am relieved. shift: I am with Frank watching a noisy play being rehearsed on stage. We leave in an old model A Ford coupe (like the one he drove around when we first met), but the car has a loose muffler and drags it noisily behind, so we have to drive very carefully to avoid pitfalls. We are at a gas station and pay our bill. I see the 9-year old girl playing hide-and-seek with other children. I wave her good-bye.
