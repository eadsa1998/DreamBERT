I am in high school or college, and after class is over, I want to throw a football around with other guys.  There is a regular football at first, but then it shrinks down to a size which is really too small to throw.  So I sit down on a bench with one of my friends and ask if we couldn't borrow one from the Phys Ed department.  He said we could but that it is really cold in there.
