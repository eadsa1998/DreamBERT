 I'm eating breakfast at a restaurant. I have eggs, toast, hash browns, one glass of orange juice, and three brown bottles of beer. I have one beer opened, and I don't want to drink the other two for breakfast, so I'm going to take them with me when I leave. My dead friend Mark Long is there. He has a three-page movie script that he has written. My friend Melanie McDyss is there. She reads Mark's script. The script is vague, with scenes prescribing action, but with the actions and words not specified. It's a very rough outline of a plot, very broad and general. There is a telephone near the kitchen sink, and this may be at the Whitman house.
