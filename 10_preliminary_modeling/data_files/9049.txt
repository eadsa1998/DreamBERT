I was working on an Excel spreadsheet, that I think was for SAID. There were many, many rows on the worksheet. Each one had a sentence in it. I was going through and rearranging them to get them in the correct order vertically on the worksheet and I was also editing them to make sure they were worded correctly - to be sure that their meaning was clear.
