[I am half-awake, but mostly asleep.  However, I am aware that I am laying there dreaming.]  It is not trance-like though, because I am reading pages and pages of material.  I mean no pauses.  There's line after line of beautiful language.  I want to remember them but don't remember any.  [I think I should keep a little dicta-recorder by my bed.  Definitely.  I really want to know what I'm writing in my sleep!!!]  When I start to be too aware of the writing, I am quite able to get back into it and produce more.  My eyes follow these lines I write as on a page.  Wild!
