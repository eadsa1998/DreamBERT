I remember that I had rushed home early one morning between classes to visit my parents. I felt rather guilty about never coming from school to see them. I stayed for two hours or so and then got ready to call a cab to go back to school. I had a 9:30 class which I had to attend. When I told my mother this, she seemed to think I was lying to her. She seemed to think that I could really stay all morning if I wanted to. Seemed very upset over the whole thing. I seemed only anxious about not getting to my class on time and regretted ever having come home at all.
