It seems that we were having a party at my house. Among other guests, there were two nuns and two fathers. They, with the other guests, were drinking beer from copper of pewter mugs. I noticed that beer kept spilling on the bare floor in the corner near a table. For some reason this was rather disturbing, so I went for a walk. The next thing I remember I was walking through a long tunnel. It was like the tunnels that connect the various lines in the large "metro" (subway) stations in Paris. I came out on Euclid Ave. in front of Moe's. I walked around on Euclid and then reentered the tunnel. I returned home to find the party over and the house quiet.
