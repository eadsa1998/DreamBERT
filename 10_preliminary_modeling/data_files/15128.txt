I was at an ice-cream shop with Mom and Ezra. I couldn't decide on what I wanted and I asked the lady if I could test this blue one. It was ok, but I decided to get cookies and cream. But Mom got it with this weird sauce and popcorn and I got angry and started to yell at her. Screech (Saved by the Bell) was around and someone mentioned Saved by the Bell and I said they probably haven't seen it. When I repeated it, I got an answer to something and Mom said "are you going to tell Dustin?". There was also an amusement park with this Miley Cyrus ride -- it was like those ones that have a seat that goes up and around and then down really fast. There was a ride near me with a duck in the far corner next to a fence. I was watching some behind the scenes Arrested Development stuff. Some guest star was excited about being in it. There was a blonde guy that looked like Beavis (Beavis &amp; Butthead). There was a show and a teenage guy and day after day was different. Something about who you were in a movie? Hiro Nakamura (Heroes) chased a bad guy up these chairs. There was some other thing where David Duchovny had dated Gillian Anderson and had cheated on her with Tea Leoni. There was a re-enactment with all of them. Someone ran through a bush.
