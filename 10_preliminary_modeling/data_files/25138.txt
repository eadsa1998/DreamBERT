 I'm with my classmate Melvin Dahlheimer, friend Hilary Nano, and another woman. We're down by Farmington. We go to a Best Western Hotel. We need to stay a night. All four of us are going to stay in the same bed. There is a folding card table there. My friend Sam Kingsley may be in place of Melvin now, in the bed. I don't get into the bed because I feel uncomfortable. I sleep somewhere else. Later a wake up and the girl is sleeping on another bed. The door to the room is swinging open. I get up to close it. Before I do, I look out to see if anyone is in the hall. No one is there. Some of the other doors are swinging open. I flick the lights in our room on and off to help me see if any intruders are there. I see a figure standing by the window. It is the resident assistant for the floor of my dorm, Jeanette. She has a gun. She turns away from the window and walks towards the bed where the girl is sleeping, pointing the gun at the girl. I pull a gun out of my coat pocket. She is threatening to kill the girl. I point my gun at her, and may have to kill her because she is a threat.
