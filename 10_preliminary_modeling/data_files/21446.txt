I was going to repair a bird cage with two tropical birds. I put it on the ground wrong side up, which was open, and one bird took off, escaped. He flew for the trees and a taillight like flashed as he flew. The other bird was ready to fly and I grabbed him in my hand and he turned into a fly. I put him down and flies started to buzz.
