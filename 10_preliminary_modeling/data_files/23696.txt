I am in a dream with Dad and family and we're traveling in a Volkswagen bus or van.  The car breaks down?  We have to push it?  We are low on food or ill-prepared and I tell Mom or Dad I'm really hungry, "don't they have any food? because I didn't bring any."  Then I remember I do have some.  And I get up and rummage around this makeshift wooden shelf built in the van, at about head level.  It's like the car is either packed full or these boards are really hard to get around.  And I see a paper bag full of my familiar foods - rice cakes, macrobiotic stuff.
