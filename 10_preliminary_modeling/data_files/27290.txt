Supposedly next summer, I had returned to the camp where I actually counseled last summer, although it did not in the least resemble that place, but rather my aunt's farm in Virginia, which is in rolling country. There were only four or five of us counselors there and we were to organize a pre-camp training course. I cannot now remember the other dream characters, (although I knew them in the dream) except one who is a friend of mine here at school. It was a very rainy, dark, dreary day when we arrived, and while we were unpacking, when our camp director assigned us jobs and I was to gather firewood, I asked, intending to be facetious, "dry firewood?" When the director looked scornful at that remark, I felt ashamed and embarrassed. As I unpacked my unusually large suitcase I discovered at the bottom dozens of candles of all sizes. I did not know why they were there, but realized they would be useful at the "final banquet," a tradition and quite an occasion.
