I was in Cassandra's house and that somehow she had this upstairs, and it was sort of like Uncle Carl's upstairs in that all the floors were wood. It was open and spacious and there was lots of natural light. And there were like different rooms. There were like three or four rooms up there. The foyer was like huge. And then there was like an office, a bathroom, and then like two bedrooms. And as I was up there, we were like visiting with some people that I didn't really know. And as I was up there, it was hard for me to tell whether it was Cassandra's second floor or whether it was our third floor. But I think at the beginning of the dream it was hers, Cassandra's, and then at the end of the dream it was ours. And whoever owned it was renting it out because who would need all that space up there, right? And there was a family living up there. And I'm starting to remember something about the beginning of this dream now. And actually I think we were supposed to do something and I kind of ran away and escaped up there so I could have some privacy and be alone. And I think I was in a room that was like my bedroom, except it was bigger and it was like cold. I mean there were like vents in the floor and the air-conditioning was coming up from the floor and it was cold. And I turned on a radio and I laid down in the bed, and the next thing I knew I was out in the foyer and I was visiting with these people. And then a little while later I got the feeling that maybe Mom and Dad owned the place, and one of the ladies said, "Maggie, could you please turn the air down? It's cold up here. I have a child in the shower right now." And I can't remember what she said. I think she said, "Oh, well, it's not been cold up here, what are you talking about?" And then I woke up.
