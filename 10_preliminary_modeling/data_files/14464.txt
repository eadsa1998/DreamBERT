Mom made me go into the shop and we got this weird shaped key, we had $10, but it was $20 so I went to Mom. I then decided I didn't want it and got the money back. Mom was babysitting Amelia. It was stormy looking outside. She said it was going to storm badly and she was going for a drive. I went along anyway and Ezra sat in the back. It said it was 4.40, which meant we were late. We ended up at Darren's parents, but they were all different and I didn't recognize anyone at the table. I started feeling weird. They all wanted to hold hands. I said I didn't want to join in, saying "I'm not doing any stupid religious stuff". Darren started crying before because his mother was sick with cancer, I think I ended up attacking Mom; I dug my nails into her. Everyone got confused. I left, still feeling odd. Everyone was ignoring me and staring at me. I was then walking with a group, including Giles (Buffy the Vampire Slayer), in a grassy area. The rest were teenagers and had to do something to stop them from getting up to no good. We were walking down a path, Giles no longer with us, so I called out and he came. I think he was angry with me. There was a pool table and he was playing pool and won. He cheated I think. Ezra was on a computer and he was watching a Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) montage. Darren said the music used was "cute" and fit the montage.  Then he said "Ew, he has a freckle on his face!".
