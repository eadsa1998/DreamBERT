I was at some place where celebrities and the like were walking through to somewhere. I bumped into Nathan Fillion in a dark hall. I stopped him and asked for a photo and he agreed reluctantly. He looked impatient and said he had 10 seconds. I got the camera ready on my phone and turned flash off and took the photo and he left. Later I went to check the photo and it was gone. I remembered we were in a different time zone as we were on the other side of the country, so I changed the time zone and then the photo was there. It looked weird and was a blurry. I showed Mom and she was like 'nice picture, he's cute'. I said "Yay Firefly, second best show of all time". I looked again later and the photo was different. He was in a different outfit and there were ski's in the background. I remembered that he had come back later and I had gotten more photos. There was a roller coaster thing there too. I can't remember properly but I had trouble getting in somewhere or something and Mom and Darren complained about it. I also saw Peter MacNicol at the place.
