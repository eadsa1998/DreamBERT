["Finding an office."] I am in a school, maybe like the community college. I have some paper work to do. But I don't have a place to work yet, as I am just starting back. I see Mabel in the hall. She greets me with a smile. She wants to show me her class she is very proud of creating. It has a teacher for each student. A mentor program. I look into the classroom from the hall. A long line of teachers are seated in a row at a table. Facing each teacher is a long line of students. The teachers are smiling and happy to be of help. The students are OK, but not as happy as the teachers. I then walk down the hall. I see a desk at the end of the hall and I feel very tired. I lie down on the desk to nap, since I can barely keep my eyes open. Later I am back up and go to an office that will become mine. Transition time.
