I am trying to return home and am late, and as the plane is starting to leave, I leap up on the top of the thing and crawl over to the front cockpit into the co-pilot's chair. The pilot chides me not to cut it so close next time and I then go back to a regular seat. It's a propeller plane, not a jet.
