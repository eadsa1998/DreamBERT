I am trying to counsel a series of people who are deaf. One man won't look at me so I can lecture or counsel him. So I write on a paper, "Damn prig." He is shocked and then reads my lips. I am pretty good at helping them. Now I'm in the back seat of my car. A woman wants to get in. She can't decide if it should be the front or back seat. I hope she doesn't taker the driver's seat, but she does. Then I see an opportunity and take over. Then three women want a ride home and I ask them where they live because if its too far, I won't do it. They give their addresses and I nod, OK, even though one is pretty far away.
