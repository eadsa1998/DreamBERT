I goof off and waste time on my way to a family reunion. As I get close, I see Charla sort of floating or climbing a fence. I want her to be with me, but she is busy playing and ignores me. I see a cousin who is leaving the reunion. I am surprised it is breaking up so soon. I'll have missed nearly all of it. I go in and see aunts, uncles, and cousins who are tired, annoyed and bored. They are getting ready to leave soon.
