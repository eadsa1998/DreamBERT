I was at Sorrento which was different. I went to a restaurant with friends. I was dating a guy and we were there with another couple. I had now become interested in Ryan Cartwright who was a friend of mine, and another girl was interested in my boyfriend. I was at a table and my chair was close to Ryan's and our legs touched. I got up and sat at a table with some other people. A homeless guy was asking for money and I said "I literally have no money". Then I was there with Dad and Rover. I got this sausage with ham in it and gave it to Rover. I was then walking with Ezra at night and I said "but we forgot Rover" and he said it didn't matter. Then the girl from before told me she liked my boyfriend and I said I didn't know why we hadn't 'swapped'. I think we eventually did. There was a movie or a TV scene where I lay on top of this guy and kissed and rolled around. There was a list of all the guys filling in and it was 16 or so different celebrities.
