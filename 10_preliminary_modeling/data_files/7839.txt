Typical Hollywood aliens, no clothes, big smooth head, dark eyes and features. I think they had something to do with Darren making himself more at home here lately and I don't like that at all. I'm trying to be nice and keep the peace during Graduation activities for Matthew's sake, but I really don't like Darren getting so comfortable here. I think I was saying to Matthew how much I enjoy it when he brings his friends over, how much I enjoy having them here. Even the aliens were okay. But I didn't want his Daddy getting so comfortable here.
