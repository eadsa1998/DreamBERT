Richard K was there. It was a prearranged marriage. We were told that we had to marry and yet it wasn't. We were someplace with a large group of people when we got married. Yet, it was as if it was secretive. I got a letter from Uncle J and Aunt A. In it was a schedule showing me when I was going to be able to live with Richard K. I was only going to be able to be with him February through September. I thought, That's only 8 months of the year and none of the winter holidays. This is very sketchy. Maybe he was going to be living with them year round and I could only live with them those 8 months. When we were packing and getting ready to leave this place. I had been rooming with another woman. She was already packed and had taken her bags out. There were a lot of electronics that I had to pack. I don't know what they were, but they were small.
