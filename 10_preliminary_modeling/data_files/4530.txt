["Dangerous waters."] Doug and Lydia, Dwight, me and Charla are at the beach. We decide we want to go out on the ocean on a boat. I am apprehensive. The waves seem rough and big. We start out through the surf. I keep asking Doug if we have extra gas on board, because we would not want to run out of gas. He says no. Then I ask if there at least some oars on board. In case we run out of gas. I pick one up and begin to paddle. Now we are out in the deep water. The boat is being pitched around by the large waves. They become larger and rougher. I am worried now. I want us to turn around before we'd gone too many miles and run out of gas. We begin to turn the boat around. Charla falls overboard. I am frantic. I can see her sinking under the water. I turn the boat back around and paddle like hell to get to her. I call to her. She seems unconscious. I reach down and grab her hair and pull her up. I get her on board. She isn't breathing. I begin CPR on her, begging her to start breathing. She chokes and becomes conscious, breathing. Thank God. I am relieved. Then I look up and see a huge tidal wave coming at us. I scream. We frantically force the boat to go as fast as it can toward shore. The wave will engulf us. I anticipate how horrible it will be to hold my breath. Maybe we will survive, maybe not. We finally manage to get back on shore, alive.
