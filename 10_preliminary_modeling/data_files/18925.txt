This dream involves the attempted and successful acquisition of a number of shares in a gold mine. Having completed the transaction, there somehow appears in the dream a newly discovered mine that I have discovered and for some reason must keep a secret. Somehow along the line another scene comes in which one person has found out about it, I don't know how and he is much like the movie character Victor McLaughlin. At any rate, he seems somehow to have been aware of this mine, and he has decided that he is going to get hold of part of it anyway from me. I'm in a very difficult position because I must keep it secret at the same time and try to deal with him. The movie character is _______________ like Victor McLaughlin. At any rate, eventually it gets to the point where we're working on the mine and it seems like I went up a long flight of steps to get to the entrance of the mine and somehow he says he's going to do me in and take the mine for himself. This rather unnerves me, but nevertheless I feel compelled to keep the whole thing a secret and try to resolve it and work it out with him. I recall clearly there being a place, well some kind of restaurant, where he is eating a meal, and at the same time I'm trying to convince him that it would be reasonable that he accept a partial ownership of the mine rather than the whole thing. To buttress this argument I offer him the figure of $85 million as his yield from his share of the mine, and I say to him many times, "Just consider it. Consider 85 million dollars. That means that you could spend 2 million dollars a year for the next 41-1/2 years." No matter how many times I repeat this, which I do several times, no matter how I try to convince him, he is still determined that he is going to kill me and take the whole mine for himself. He seems completely impenetrable to any arguments I put forth. I'm being frustrated and yet determined and at the same time, strangely enough, not frightened of his plan of killing me, although I believe he's fully capable of it. Finally I seem to find myself tied up in a large plastic bag, and he's mixing a large trough of cement into which somehow I'm going to be immersed or in some way done in. Anyway I begin to argue with him about this mine again. Somehow or another, I don't remember how, I convince him to take me out of this plastic bag so we can discuss it further. The next scene is he's chasing me, and he chases me to a spot where there are 2 automobiles parked front end to front end so that the bumpers are touching. He begins to chase me around these 2 cars and we go around and around and around many, many times, going back and forth and he's getting angrier and angrier at me because he can't catch me. This seems to take place on a street such as Douglas Avenue where there's a few homes set back off the road and a couple of small palm trees there. All the while he's chasing me, I'm still trying to convince him that he should be partners with me. Actually having offered him 85 million, it represents more than 50% in an attempt to placate him. Then it seems across the street a very large truck pulls up and driving the truck is a female, very young and attractive and sitting next to her is her sister. They get out of the truck and lift the hood of the truck, somehow seemingly indicating that something was wrong with it. At this my pursuer walks over there and somehow engages in a conversation, and he went into the house with one of the girls in front of which they were parked, and somehow I believe I become engaged in conversation with the other one.
