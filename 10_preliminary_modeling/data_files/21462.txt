I waded thru water knee deep across the street. I passed a basket above water. There were bees around it. I heard a baby crying in the basket. I was riding my bicycle. It was dark, night and my headlight would go off and on. There were a lot of crates of bananas on the sidewalk. I walked into a store and by a woman customer and the first thing I knew I was snagged with some string. I was unraveling it and the woman was also tied with the string. I was unraveling the string from my rosary.
