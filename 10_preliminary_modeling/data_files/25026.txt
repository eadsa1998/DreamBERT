 I'm at home. My parents, and my siblings are there. We are packing to move to Cheyenne, South Dakota. The town has about 2,500 people. It's a six-hour drive. I do not want to go. I put a fishing rod in the car. There are two station wagons. One of them is the old yellow station wagon that the family used when I was a child. My dad may have a beard, like when he was younger. We are moving because my dad got a new job. He starts tomorrow. The ride is going to be hell, I know, with all of us riding in the same car. I am really mad! I want to yell and scream and protest. Why The Fuck Are We Moving???!!!
