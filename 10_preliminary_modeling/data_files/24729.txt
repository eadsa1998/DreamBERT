There was a tornado. Somehow I found shelter and didn't get sucked away. After we came out we discovered that a lot of cars were still there, so we explored the cars. Later, my friend pushed his sister on the gravel and she got an injury on her head, it wasn't bad though, just a little cut. Later we were playing this game with some kids, we could tune our ears to hear what they were saying. Also my friend kept going to the little trailer park to visit this woman and man. Setting: At a park. Characters: A few of the kids that we played with I knew, and the friend that pushed his sister is my friend, but I don't know the sister. The woman and man at the trailer park, I knew the woman (my friend's mom) and the guy I don't know. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, scared, worried. I was scared when the tornado was over us. I was worried about my friend's sister, and other than that I was happy!
