I saw myself in a mirror with blonde hair, and I was sullen.  The me in the mirror moved separately from my movements, it was very creepy and I was sort of afraid.  The image reached through and grabbed at me.  I tried punching it and yelling.  I found my father and told him what happened.  My boyfriend Jeremy was a bike racer.
