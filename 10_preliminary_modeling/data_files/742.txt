The kids were playing on a lawn. My mother was watching them. I said, "It's nap time." We walked over to a room and put them down for a nap. I went across street to a motel and took a room. I was going to read the letter sent with hands but some cleaning persons were around. The blonde guy appeared to explain why he sent the hands to me. The army in the shape of a lieutenant came and inducted me as private. I laughed. They ordered me to march. I didn't take them seriously. I "play marched" around.
