I was at Mom's. She said the cops were going to come past and so she would take me away. As we were driving out, we passed a police car. Later, Darren took some guys car. It was white and just a normal car, but he was going to do it up. I was out the front, and this guy and his friends came to the door. I saw them walking away after Darren spoke to them. Later, Darren was out the front working on it. He took the back plate off and replaced it with a new one. The guys drove past and Darren realized the old plate was still up (started with UXM). I took it off. I emptied out the back of the car, so it wasn't obvious that it was their car. Six months later, it now looked like a hearse. I was inside the house, and it looked like it was orange. The guy came back to check it. He said to Darren that six months later, it was on sale for $5000, and it was $250? He was suspicious of Darren. I was with Dad and Ezra later in the van. On the radio, Well Respected Man was playing. I was singing along and told Ezra it was in the last episode of Supernatural. Then we were in a bus. Samantha was there too. Dad changed the station and it was playing AC/DC.
