There was a class on for writing. Eugene was there. I pretended not to see him. I had to go across the hall to another room for a bit and Geneva was there. This lady talked to us and then we left. Mom wasn't there to pick me up so I called her. Eugene got on a bicycle and left and it had a licence plate. I left with Mom but before we did Eugene's father Abraham was talking to us and flirting with me. We ended up back at their house which was different. Then his father and some others were being weird. We went to the elevator to leave. This priest guy was there and we waited for him to leave and then we got on. They Eugene came with this big blowup like thing. They caught him so we opened the doors and let him in. We got down and ran to the car and then left. We were in my car and I didn't have much petrol. We ended up falling off a cliff but we were okay. We went back to Eugene's building. Then I was at this hole in the wall where I had put stuff when I was younger - stuff that was worth money such as drugs, rocks, a big fat fish and 'dog' fish (which were cute).
