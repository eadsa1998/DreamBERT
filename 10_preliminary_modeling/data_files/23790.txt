I was driving in an area much like that between Monticello and Moab.  Big cut canyons, red and bluff rocks, crevices, desert.  It was beautiful and wild, no other people around.  It seemed more off the main road than Highway 191.  I passed a special place, and I said, this is where I am going to build a house, right in this canyon mouth, up against these rocks.  I picked the exact spot I wanted my house.
