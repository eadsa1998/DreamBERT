I was on a bus trip somewhere. We stopped for a break and I got some food for me and someone else on the bus. Everyone got back on to the bus and were ready to leave so I had to run out there. We get to where we were going and everyone got off the bus. There was a conflict between me and another kid. I think it may have been this guy Joe, but I'm not sure. My boyfriend was there also and someone else. I think they were all on the bus also. Joe began hitting me with a pipe. It didn't hurt. Then I took it away and began to hit him with it. There was a reason for the whole thing, but I can't remember what.
