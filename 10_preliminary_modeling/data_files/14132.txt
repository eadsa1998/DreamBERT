I was at Mom's, which was different. I was on a balcony and it was apartment like. We had a cover thing and they put it down. Darren was there. I went downstairs and there was a jumper. I pressed ctrl-c and it turned out smaller -- it was a setting. Mom had gone on my computer and seen my Chris Barrie desktop. She was telling Darren later and said she "had no clue". I had been in some Red Dwarf episodes and I was thinking I wasn't funny or good enough to be on it. I wondered how I had been on it.
