Dreamt of a class.  Having to give an oral report in a lecture hall in French for my French teacher.  It was something I'd done before...dreamt before.  The first time it was before my French class, so it was difficult.  I wanted to do the same report.   Something about a little girl that made tiny, tiny mittens.  She had some siblings.  We were going over a long stone stairway on the side of the building.  In a small room, a big woman, I think, opposed.  We had to get around her and it took an elaborate scheme that I'm failing to remember now.  But we did it.  Then I got to class and found out that I had to start from scratch with a different report.
