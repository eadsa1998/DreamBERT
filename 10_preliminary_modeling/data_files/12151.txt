I was watching TV and Seriously Weird was on. They were in class and the camera was going across everyone, most of the people weren't actually in the show. Harris was upside down. Then I was in the class and we had detention for 10 minutes. There was a 24 hour clock. I put my mobile phone in my bag, but it was actually some guy in the class called Dylan's bag. I went to get it but he took it out of his bag. He opened it and saw a picture of me and said "What the fuck?" and he had a really small phone.
