The other night I dreamed that my boyfriend came over to take me out; however, we only had about an hour to spend together. So he kept saying maybe we shouldn't go out tonight. Maybe we should wait until tomorrow and I'll go to Canton tonight. He kept on repeating Canton, Canton, and then the next thing I knew, we were examining little white flowers.
