This seems to have taken place sometime in the past. It's primarily an argument with my Aunt Marie, and it gets more and more vociferous, starting out as making an objection to something and ending up really slamming the table. It was about her leaving the house or leaving some house to me which all looked very nice on paper and so forth, but if you know this house, the only thing you get out of this house is bills. My mother's also in this. She's not directly involved. I'm saying, "If you want to leave me the house, then leave some money too. It costs to run that house. I'd be happy to do you a favor and take care of it, but I don't want to own that house because it costs too much money." The figure 9 and the figure 5 fit in there somewhere. I guess that refers to either how much money I would have to have to keep the house or something. It's like the louder I shout, the more I convince myself that it's possible that I really want this house. At the end I'm really convinced that I'd rather not have it at all. It's a very familiar feeling with my Aunt Marie. She has a way of getting you all fouled up if you didn't watch out. Not out of maliciousness, but just out of ignorance and plain inability to see anybody else's position but her own.
