 I'm at the top of a huge mountain with two men. There is a woman there with ski boots and poles but no skis. She is going to jump and step down the hill. The hill is very steep. I go near the edge of the hill. I think I will slip and fall down. The hill is a cliff-like slope. I hang onto a branch and ask my two friends to help me up. I pull myself up the cliff. There is a little station at the top of the hill, like a ranger station. There is a ranger in a suburban. We walk over to a different place and look at the slope. It is steep! People have huge plastic toboggan sleds made of colored plastic that are 20 or 30 feet long. There is a gentler sloping run and people slide down it. It's fast! One woman hits some trees, but is okay. I think she'll get hurt. I think two men and I should go on a run down the hill in the big sled.
