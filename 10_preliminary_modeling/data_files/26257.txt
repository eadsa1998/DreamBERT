 I'm in my Brain, Mind, and Behavior class. It is in one of the large quad rooms in Wonkers Hall. My friends Melanie McDyss and Erica Lange are in the class. We're going over a test that was just returned to us. I got a 54 on the test, which was the highest score. Melanie got a 53. This is the first time I've ever scored higher than Melanie. We are all asked the question, "How do we know... (something)?" I answer something about the bipolar spatial map in the brain. There is another question that one got credit for if they put their name, as if that is proof for their being. My answer was about driving by the Powerton power plant, where I remember something about learning a special lesson on color. When one is responding one holds a pen: the answering pen. I give the answering pen to Melanie.
