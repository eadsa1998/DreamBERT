I was watching some comedy show. Eliza Dushku and a blonde girl were hiding under a blanket and a box on a bench. People came and lifted them up and the girl was like 'Micah!' and Eliza was like 'it's Meccah'. Someone asked me if I was nervous when getting her autograph and I said 'no, I'm not really a fan'. I said she was uglier in real life and I was more nervous when getting Summer Glau's autograph.
