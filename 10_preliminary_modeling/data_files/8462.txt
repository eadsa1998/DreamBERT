Matthew was about 7-8 years old. He came and climbed in my lap. He was Darren's son by another woman and he was asking me about his birth mom and if she just didn't want him. I sat and was assuring him that was not at all the case. Later he asked if Angie Ho was his birth mom. I said I honestly didn't know and that he would have to ask his Dad.
