There was a long line at the SSI Office. We had to wait in line. Then the fat lady printed out files on each person. While we were waiting I went out to the parking lot. A man was in the car sleeping. When I went back the files had been spit out of a computer. White paper with blue writing. They were all connected--leaflet style but accordion folds between people. I looked at mine. It had the first whole section of the 3rd grade South Caroline history book. It started with the road sign, "You are now entering historical Laurens." It had information about the run. The lady at the desk said, "This is the longest file I've ever seen." I thought I would get in trouble for looking, but I only looked up mine. It was almost 5:00 on Friday. The lady was not back. I went back on Saturday and the line was out the door.
