My brother and I are in the jungle. I'm not a medic but a radio operator. My brother is new to Vietnam. I'm breaking him in. I receive a message from a pilot flying an OV 10 Bronco, a lightly armed reconnaissance plane. The pilot names a part he needs. I take out a pen, spread a napkin on the ground, tell my brother to hold it flat while I write. My brother laughs at me. I take out my forty-five pistol and say, "If you do that again, I'll kill you." My brother laughs. I shoot him point blank in the chest. I wake up saying, "You didn't listen so I killed you."
