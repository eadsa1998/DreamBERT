I was going to fly to London, just because. And I didn't really have anything that was scheduled to happen over there. I didn't have any conference or group thing to go to. I just was going to go to this strange city in Europe, and I was just going to show up and I was going to wander around until I found something -- I don't know -- I was just going to wander around and try to be a tourist in a big, strange city. And then I was thinking about how long the flight would be and I was thinking about how scary it would be to just show up and not really have anybody there with me. And I think there was some more. I think I decided that I was just going to stay in this country and go to one of the conferences or something like that. And then last night I had a dream that I was at the Westport High School library, but I thought it was at the college. And Mrs. Talmadge was there and she looked a lot like Kathy Bates in "Harry's Law" and it was like that in that the library had a whole bunch of shoes and things at the very front, and then you had to go in the back to look for books. And I was walking around and looking at the shoes, trying to find some books. And then there was this dog that was wandering around in there and I was back in the back for some reason. I think there was a CC TV back there that I was going to use. And the dog was wandering around, and the people were asking me to try to keep him corralled back in the back and not go out to the front where all the people were. And I was looking for a back door so that I could let him out if he had to go outside. And then that was all.
