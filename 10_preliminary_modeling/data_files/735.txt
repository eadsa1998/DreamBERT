I was in old living room in M City. A doctor of mine comes in. He says that I must be at an early morning panel discussion about some new discoveries about curing arthritis. My father and Dwight are sitting with us. The doctor says that the new discovery is latex paint. It causes a "burning throat" and this somehow cures arthritis. I am incredulous; he is full of enthusiasm. He says I must get up at 1:30 am to be at the discussion. I say, "Wow! That's bad because then I also have to get up at 8:00 am for another meeting." My father says, "Well, these difficulties must be met with in life sometimes." The doctor agrees. I ask if oil painting does the same thing. He says, "No, only latex."
