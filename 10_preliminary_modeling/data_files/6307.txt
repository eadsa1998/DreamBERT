I am having an exam in my culture and diversity class. There is a lot of material to remember. I had a dream that I was sitting in class taking the exam and I could not remember anything that I studied. The clock kept ticking away and I could not write anything. I started to cheat off the girl in front of me. I wrote all her answers down. The professor was getting suspicious. I started to sweat a lot; sweat was dripping down my forehead. The teacher came over and whispered the answers in my ear. I could not believe it, but when I looked down on my paper it was blank again. Next thing I woke up.
