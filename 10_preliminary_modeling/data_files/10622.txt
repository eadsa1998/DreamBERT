I was at a beach house with four friends (I've never seen any of them before, but I know one of them is named Adam.) I was talking to Adam when all of a sudden we heard ghosts that we could see. I ran into my parents' room and got under the covers and I could only see the ghost's head. He was really cute. He threw eggs at my parents, but not at me, so I went off with him and three girl ghosts who were doing weird, scary tricks. Then they all left and there were a set of new ghosts which were all exciting. There was always one cute guy which I went off with except for the third set of ghosts who only argued about doing dishes while we partied with the other ghosts. The sets of ghosts came in shifts of day and night. It was awesome.
