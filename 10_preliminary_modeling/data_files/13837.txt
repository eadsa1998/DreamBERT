I had been doing a family tree and had discovered that we were related to Martin Sheen. It had a photo of Charlie Sheen, then Martin. Someone like Martin's sister had someone who was related to us. Nana saw it and she was like "Sheen?" and I said yeah and that I was going to go as far back as I could.
