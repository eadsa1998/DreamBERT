I was at Comic-Con a few days early. Joan Rivers had a food stall and made me sit and eat chips with lots of tomato sauce. I left and there was a monkey with long dirty hair and I brushed it. I sat down but it ran away when I finished. I found it again and put it in my car, along with a guinea pig, because I was collecting one of each animal.
