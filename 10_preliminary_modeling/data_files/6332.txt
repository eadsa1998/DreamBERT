I was being detained in a kind of prison in a former communist country in central Europe. The prison was in Europe, but it was designed exactly like Fenway Park in Boston. I was being held along with a group of students, but why we were being detained was unknown. Apparently we were found guilty of some crime that nobody seemed to understand. Groups of us were sequestered into various locations throughout the prison. The conditions of the cells were very primitive. They were large rooms with cement floors that were covered with straw. Upon arrival at the prison, our clothes had to be traded in for very worn, loose-fitting outfits that were tied at the waist with ropes. The prison, being the actual size of Fenway Park, seemed very large. There were very few people around except for ouselves and prison officials. While we were unable to go outside of the prison, we were permitted to move around inside of it. The halls and passageways were relatively empty, but there were people working at the concession stands. At one point the other prisoners and I decided I should attempt to buy some beer at one of the concession stands. I found a beer stand and asked if I were allowed to purchase some beer. I reached into my pocket and found money that I could pay for it with. The attendant replied that I could buy some beer if I hadn't had any codeine within the last 20 hours. I remembered that the prison officials had given me some medications earlier that day with codeine, so I was not able to have the beer. At that point I began walking around in the large and desolate prison. I remember nothing further about this dream.
