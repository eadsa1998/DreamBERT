 I'm in a town. There is a physically small woman in charge. Others are there. My classmates Tim Tire and his girlfriend Georgia are in front of a building. They run and look for someone. I am looking also, but am not in the dream. A horse runs out of the turnstile in the building. I am furious that this has happened! I hold up the small woman in charge by the neck. People are appalled that I do this. I don't care about their reactions: I am furious! I ask what things are doing in front of the building.
