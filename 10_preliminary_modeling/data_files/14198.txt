I was at school which was different with Calvin and we were trying to leave. I got a call from Ms Braun saying the yearbooks were ready but they weren't actually the yearbooks. I had $20, which was enough for it as they were $7.99 each. I went to health block and Mr Quinlan was in there. Ms Braun sent me to the English block. Ms Pascal was on the phone when I got there. She asked if I was in trouble or wanted something. She gave me the yearbook thing. She asked if I was ok about the "English Sofia award". It was like the "razzies". I was getting it for being the worst English student. I remembered getting a note about it before. We were then at the liquor store at Midvale and it was really neat and tidy. Ezra was there. I remembered when Dad used to work there and it was messy and big. 'Greasers' used to hang outside and Poppers and the others would call the cops on them.
