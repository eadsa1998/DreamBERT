I was at the Technical College though we had class but it was in a weird area. There was water for swimming in which went around like a path. Mom and Dad were both there for unrelated reasons. Dad had a picture of a pile of text books and was about to send them in a message to Dan Palmer. He said he was going to send them to my boyfriend and I said didn't have one and I was like 'oh my god, don't send I haven't even spoken to him in 2 years ' and I got annoyed and Dad got angry and was like 'not spoken in 2 years?!' And I thought I saw Christian James nearby and I was saying like he was just some random and I wasn't gonna just talk to him. I was in the water and Dad was in a mood and I ignored him as I went by and Tristan was there, who I also ignored. I heard him asking Tristan something and Tristan was saying that I'm everyone's favourite and pointed to somewhere around the corner (straight for him, corner for me) and said they were the main ones. I went around and found Fletcher and someone else in the water too. I was happy to see Fletcher there but then he said he forgot he'd changed class and his actual class was over other side of campus, he looked a bit sad about this and seemed like he wanted to stay as he got out. I said just come back to this class and he seemed reluctant.
