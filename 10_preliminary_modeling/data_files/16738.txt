I'm on another school trip. I'm late getting to the train and it's leaving without me. I have my hand on the train by a bar. I ask Mr. Dell if I should try to get on, even though it's starting to move. He puts up his hand as if to say, "one minute." I don't have a minute, and I'm running with the train as much as it's pulling me with it. We go under bridges and I'm afraid I might get cut off by the bridge, although I'm not. The train stops and I quickly get on via the back. I wake up.
