 I'm in a house. It is early morning. I drink a can of Pepsi, and then start to sip a Pepsi out of a blue Brimson glass. I eat what I think are cylindrical ham sticks, about _ inch in diameter and 1.5 inches long. These ham sticks are actually frog. Not frog legs, however, but rather whole frogs, which are the size of my pinky fingernail. <br/
