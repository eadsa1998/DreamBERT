There was a new season of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. It had good ratings and there was something about Danny Devito joining. It was season three though. I found a download for it and I was watching it. It had a laugh track though and it wasn't that funny. I used a fake account to complain about some DVD's. I was talking to Ezra and I checked my post and there were lots of replies. I checked my quiz and 40 people had taken it now. I was then sleeping and Darren's alarm went off, but it was in my room. I took it and chucked it on their bed and woke him up. I was then out somewhere, walking, I think. There was a house on fire, which was across the road. There was some other smoke coming from somewhere nearby. Someone was setting a house on fire over there. Dad and I tried to get home and it was confusing to get back. There was a busy road with a tunnel underneath.
