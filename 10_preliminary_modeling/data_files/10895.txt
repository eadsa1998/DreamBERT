I dreamed that I was a small child, staying at the home of an aged lady. She kept insisting that I go upstairs to see her beautiful daughter, which I finally did. I opened the door and she was lying on the bed--dead. I did not walk over to her, I just knew she was dead. I came back downstairs and couldn't bring myself to tell the old lady that she was dead. I knew we were having company and I was worried that they would come soon. A large group of people walked through the front door and upstairs without knocking. I knew they would find the dead girl. I stood down at the foot of the stairs and heard much talking upstairs. I ran out of the front door and down the street.
