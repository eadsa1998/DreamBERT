I am conducting some sort of class. I tell the women to break up into three groups. One group is looking for jobs. Another group is looking for career and adventure, and a third group is genuinely wanting to be housewives and mothers. They each have a group project they are working on. I go to observe each group. As they use the tinsel-like materials to create something, I notice the housewife group wears lots of frills. Then the women are leaving and they haven't completed their task. I tell them to complete it. Each group hands me their project, almost finished. They look like fancy junky designs. I'm not pleased. Then I am swimming in a narrow channel. At first my strokes are only half completed. Then I stretch out and do each stroke correctly. I am going very fast, the water sparkling. My hands cleaving the water very sharply at each stroke. Now I turn to go back. The channel narrows until it is just a metal 2 inch strip that I am climbing up. It goes straight up very high and I get scared of heights. The two tracks meet and I have to let go of one to transfer to the other. I am scared and hardly want to let go for fear of falling.
