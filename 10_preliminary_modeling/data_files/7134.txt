I fall off the boat but float with a camera on my breast trying to take pictures as a lifeboat approaches to rescue me. Then I am taken to receive third polio immunization. This time the doctor puts drops up my nose instead of giving me a swallow. Dr. asks me to give him a ____. I think he means to spit up phlegm, but he says, "Your nose is bleeding." I try to stanch it with paper and see the red stains growing less and less.
