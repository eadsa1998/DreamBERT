 There is a dead zebra and another animal. They are dead because the gene population is being altered, manipulated to produce a better breed of zebra. The dead zebra is small, and is moved to a different chamber with other dead animals. All the animals are in white plastic. They are small: no larger than a few feet high. This takes place in a sterile laboratory setting. There are many plain, spotless rooms for lab purposes.
