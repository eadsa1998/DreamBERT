I was on a cruise ship and I remember we were with some of the fire people and we were eating chicken fingers and stuff from the buffet. And we were kind of dancing at this little dance bar buffet restaurant on the cruise ship, and then we decided that we weren't going to, we decided we were going to get in little dinghies and go row alongside of the ship. And so I was in my little dinghy and I kept tipping it over like a canoe, and by the time I knew it, I was floating on top of it. And then all of a sudden we were at home, and Mom and I were blasting the sound system waiting for Dad and the fire people to come over and join the party. And some lady -- I think it was the HRS lady from Melinda's case -- came in and wanted some tea, some herbal tea from Mom. And she was real rude. And we ended up shutting off everything before the people got to the party. And then I woke up.
