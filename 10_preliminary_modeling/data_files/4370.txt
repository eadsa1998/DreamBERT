["Patricia the great hostess."] Patricia had invited me to spend the weekend at her house. She comes to the airport to pick me up. then drives me to her house. We go in and she is talking about her hostess skills. She says she is like a surgeon, skilled in her craft of presenting music and opera and so on. She brings me an example of her special meals she prepares for occasions she is hosting. She shows me a plate with three hot-dogs spread out like a fanfare of three trumpets. A guest would put their lips up to the edge of a plate where the three hot-dogs touched and kiss it. Then the guest, (a child) would look like a heralding angel. We walk down a spacious hall toward the sitting room. Before we enter, she shows me another plate where the hot-dogs are now a kitten grown and trained to have short bowed legs. The kitten has a biscuit coat baked on so it is shaped like a hot-dog. We are expected to eat this kitten. I feel unsure of doing this. Patricia is quite proud of her special skills as a hostess.
