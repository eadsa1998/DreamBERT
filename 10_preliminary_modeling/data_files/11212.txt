I was in the 5th grade in elementary school, that Rita Hayworth was the teacher, but that she was well over 40 years old. She wore a red and white striped dress which was much too small for her. Her appearance was anything but what the common conception of it is now. She was quite ugly. I do not remember the exact subject she was teaching at the time.
