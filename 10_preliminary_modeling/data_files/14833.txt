I was watching Heroes. Niki/Tracey got a glimpse into the future. There was this weird purple creature. They were on top of hair? There were lots of discussions. Someone teleported Claire up to see. Dmitri put Peter against a glass wall and said he was Sylar and then he saw Claire and Dmitri got through, not wanting Claire to see, and said "no!" and Peter fell and then ran out. Then I was with some friends. Some of them were gay and there were some relationships in the mix. There was a girl with big clothes on (or it was a guy in drag) and my friend was like "You're much prettier" (about me). They were gay and sounded gay.
