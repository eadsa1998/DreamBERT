This is a part of a longer dream. The first part that I remember concerns swimming in the ocean. I do not remember getting wet, but I was struggling against the waves to get to shore. I came to a shallow place, but still had to fight my way along. I remember thinking that this was significant and I must not forget the dream. I finally got ashore. Next I think I was in some church with a friend of mine (f, 19). People kept arriving, and one was my friend's boyfriend. He brought her something, but I forgot what it was. I felt lonely so I withdrew. I was doing something in the rear of the church (writing or reading, I think) and not paying any attention to the service. I looked around (my back was to the congregation) and noticed that folding doors had cut me off from the rest so I felt relieved. Then I remember someone I knew (I don't remember who it was or the sex) came riding along a road on a bicycle. I said, "You're a long way from home." The person talked to me a while and then left.
