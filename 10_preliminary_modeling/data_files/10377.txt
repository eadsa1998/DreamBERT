At a SKI RESORT: we ski downhill following a good skier who made a trail for us. At the top of the mountain there is a birthing room where women are about to give birth; see a woman straining, but it is false labor. The next day we ski downhill again, and I am puzzled that there is no one in the birthing room, only wet newspapers drying on a lone pine tree. shift: see two large cats in a cage.
