I have apparently bought a huge very nice house with a large entry way and a banquet sized dining room kitchen. A heated swim pool in the back yard. Lydia and her children (high school age) are visiting me. I mop the entry way. I have to walk what looks like a mile to the other end of the house it is so big. I wonder why I chose to have such a large house at this age of my life with the kids growing up and moving out. I like the house but the work keeping it up is a lot. I go out and swim in the pool. I am under water and floating toward the surface. I then see a man watching me from an upstairs window in the neighbors house. He's living there for the summer, writing a novel. He comes over because I invited him to have ice cream with me and talk writing. I tell him I am writing a novel too.
