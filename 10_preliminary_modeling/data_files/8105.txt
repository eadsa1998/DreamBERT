I was on a bus. A man in one of the seats rose into the air as if levitating, and floated there on his back with knees bent. He had a jar of some kind of cream in his right hand. He raised his shirt, reached into the jar for some of the cream, and rubbed it on his stomach. As he did so he rolled over, face down now, and then up, in a seated position. He then floated gently back into his seat. He was wearing khaki shorts and a Hawaiian-type shirt.
