I walk with my family on a night that is a feast at my hometown. The night was cold and foggy, but the people were full of joy because it was the Eve of the feast of the Patron Saint. I arrive at the amusement park. I look at the rides. I decide to go with my sister on the Ferris wheel. It was starting to rain. I am at the highest point in the wheel and the wheel stops. I have a terrible premonition, a feeling of tragedy and fatality. The electric cables, wet with the rain, go on and off. They start to catch fire. A collective cry of panic reaches my ears. I go down with the wheel, falling precipitously.
