I dreamed that I was talking online with Tyler, and he all of a sudden blocked me. I got really sad and tried to ask Alexis if he was still online, but she was in Jamaica. Then everyone from my 8th grade class died. I was supposed to write a eulogy for all of them, but I had to write about Peter Pan and history of the progression from the book to the Disney movie. Anyway, days later, I was talking online to Aidan, and then he blocked me too! So now I was really mad, and Alexis came over and told me that my screen name had disappeared, so that's why no one was talking to me. Then she left for college, and my father got mad at me for being online late at night.
