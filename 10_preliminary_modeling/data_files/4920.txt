["No help to be had."] I am bussing home from California. I have some physical problem and end up on a military ambulance. They are brusque and non helpful. They give me some pills. I see some broken Vicadan pills and attempt to swallow them with applesauce. One gets stuck and I have a hard time swallowing it. Finally I am successful. Now they want me to swallow other pills. I ask what they are. They refuse to tell me. Then they threaten to force them down me if I do not comply. I tell them of my throat condition and how they could kill me if they did that. They are militarily insistent. I decide to leave. I have to walk as they won't assist me and the ambulance in non accessible. I walk slowly with difficulty and struggle down the 2 steps of the vehicle painfully. Then they dump my power wheelchair onto the ground and take off. I am left on a hillside by the side of the road. I see a bus stop and go there. I am trying to figure out where I am. There are shelves with booklets and information on them. I figure out I'm at a college but can't get the name of it. Y College is on one booklet. Finally I see some students. I tell one I am trying to get home and can't figure out where I am. I am stranded. They are concerned and many of them gather around me to hear my story. One woman student suggests I write my adventures down as stories. I say I always do that. I ask for help. They suggest there is a woman who helps out emergency situations. I ask them to contact her. They say no, as it is 11pm and they don't want to disturb her. I am frustrated. All I want to do is go home and I need help to do that. Where will I sleep, how do I get an accessible bus. Which is the right one. Where am I? They say I am at P College.
