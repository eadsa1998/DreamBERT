["Rip Off."]  Jerry Seinfeld is around and flirting with me. He and I are going to go away on a fun trip. We are laughing and packing things. Then after a time, I am ready to go only to discover that it isn't Jerry Seinfeld I will be going with after all. It will be Dave Roof. I am disappointed. I wonder if I can manage going with him.
