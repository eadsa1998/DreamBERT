 I am at the Casino playing Double Down Stud. I get four 5's. I double down. I end up with four of a kind. I win $182.50. The attendant comes. They take me into a room to sign a release. They have been monitoring me. They tell me a bunch of symptoms I wasn't aware of for a particular disease that they think I have, but I don't think I do. There are boxes of fake ID's on the floor.
