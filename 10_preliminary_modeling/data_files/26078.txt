 I'm canoeing in the Big Resort Area with others in one or two other canoes behind me. We're on a lake in the late afternoon or evening. We are camping on an island. The lake is K_____ ( I forget). I point to the west, saying that's where the car is from us. I say it's three miles, but later say it is 10 miles. The island we're camping on is in front of us, to the north. The sun would seem to be setting in the south, or I'm mixed up! I lead the three canoes into a stream and paddle up it until I get to a bald tree trunk, which has fallen, across the stream. I want to go beyond it to make sure our portage is there before we all cross over the trunk. I get out of my canoe, stand on the trunk, and move my canoe to the other side of the tree trunk. My coworker Carol Flanders is behind me. I tell her not to cross until I've found the portage, just so I'm sure it is there.
