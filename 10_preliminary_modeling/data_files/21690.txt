I was fixing a wall hammer attachment. Joe Sanrellow put up one of those attachments on the wall. There was a strong and tough druggist. Two boys came up to him and got tough with him. He just hit them and over they went. They went and got their gang and came back. The druggist hit the two boys again. He didn't see the rest of the gang. They got out of their hiding places and jumped the druggist. They picked him up and he was asking for mercy. I gave directions to a girl who was going to a post office in town. I was driving and I came to a narrow road and U-shaped with a  traffic light. Some of the traffic went thru on the red, but I waited for the green. I asked myself if 4 and 20 would win today and I visualized people, what they seemed to think of 4 and 20 winning today, and their heads seemed to start to nod yes, then they disappeared. I saw one face with a big hook nose and asked, she started to nod yes. I heard her say Vicky.
