[1997-07-27] I'm back at my old job again, the radiology office. I told you I was a darkroom tech, and in the dream I was back in the very familiar darkroom. One of the first jobs of the day was to turn on the darkroom dryers where the film would go to be dried. I was trying to turn these 2 switches on. The top one worked fine, the bottom one was defective. I got irritated, I knew there was a short in it but there was a female patient in my darkroom standing at the top part of the dryer which is like a counter top. She was standing there writing out the last of her wedding invitations. I wanted her to get out of my way. Also in that room was a device called a pass box. That's a lead lined box where the films, in their lead cases, were passed between the x-ray room and the darkroom so that they were totally safe from any light exposure. I reached my hand up, on top of this pass box for some reason and there was a whole stack of already done wedding invitations and then a friend of mine, Neal was there and I don't know what he was supposed to be doing, but he was conducting some kind of a raffle. If you put in two 5 dollar bills, and if you were very lucky, it could increase to 200 dollars so I took my wallet and gave him a 10 dollar bill, thinking that that should be as good as two 5 dollar bills, or does he really want two 5's.
