I was in Greece, in a big city.  My wife Anita was at the hotel, and I think I had been attending a conference.  I was trying to find my way back to the hotel.  The city was an amazing place: there were huge buildings, unusual designs, new buildings under construction, and walkways that connected many of the buildings inside, and lots of stairs and escalators and narrow twists and turns.  I came to one open excavation which seemed to be as deep as a skyscraper was tall, and I recoiled in fright from the edge of it.  I came to another room which was a huge empty carpeted room with all glass on one side.  A couple of people were talking in the middle of it, and one of them offered to assist me.  I was totally lost.  One staircase was labeled "Men" and "Women."  I went down expecting to find restrooms, but instead found myself in a pornography shop, but instead of peepshows and magazines, there were long, narrow, open booths with women and men sitting on benches along both sides, the women in various stages of undress, but none completely naked.  I was very uneasy and got out immediately.  Soon after I left a man who was following me began talking to me; that made me uneasy too, but he seemed genuinely friendly.
