I was trapped in the house of this lady who looked like Malificent from "Sleeping Beauty." I was trying to save a girl. In the dream, I was a guy, but I never saw myself. I tried to escape by going out a window of one of the rooms, but in every room there was something hindering me. For example, in one room there was a panther; in another there was a bird, etc. I went into one room and found the character of "Seven" (a little kid) from the television show "Married with Children." I told him that if he helped me, I would give him a lot of candy. He agreed and the three of us climbed out a window. The lady who looked like "Malificent" screamed at us not to leave. All of the sudden I heard a lion roar. We ran and hid. The lion was trying to find us. I stepped out and was going to face the lion, but it had turned into this big, beefy guy. I had a gun, so I shot at him. It was only a water gun. He just laughed and was about to kill the girl I was saving. I shot at him again and then he shot at me. The gun was not a normal gun, though. It shot a bead of red light, but he missed me. I started to laugh and said, "You missed me." He said, "But the bead won't." He pointed to the bead. It was bouncing around and I feared that it would hit me, so I picked up a long beam of wood. I blocked the shot with the wood and grabbed the bead, which now was a silver bullet. I said to the guy, "Ha! This is a silver bullet. I'M RICH!!" The guy got really angry and picked up the other long, wooden beam. At that moment I got a view of William Shatner. His face just covered the screen of my dream. Then I woke up.
