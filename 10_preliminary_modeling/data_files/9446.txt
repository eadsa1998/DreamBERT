Visiting Lucinda (college friend from B. City). Confusion. I leave to watch B. (college research fellow) at a graduation ceremony. I lose him in the crowd. Run after him, wearing red shoes and black suit. Catch up with him and try to embrace him, but he says, "No it would be too much like an extramarital affair." I return to visit L. We walk by the river. We talk about Frank. She says, "For me, his adolescent behavior stands out" and I tell her of his good qualities. And that I miss him. We laugh and have fun; look down and see Frank lying next to a girl trying to make love to her on a boat landing. He sees me and is very very abashed and looks away guiltily. I am furious. I jump across a little brook and say to L. "You are right. This takes away all my feeling from him, just like that." Snapping my finger. But then I mellow and say, "But of course I do love him. It doesn't matter. He has his reasons..."
