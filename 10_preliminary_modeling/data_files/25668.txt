 I am on my paper route in Oak Valley. I'm on Curve Avenue and 2nd Street. My friends Kari Kosslyn and Ivory Alshire are with me. I'm wearing my Phillips 66 shirt. It starts raining. Kari and Ivory think that it's weird that I stand in the rain, but I do. I walk with Kari towards Last Avenue. I am standing behind her, and I start to touch her sexually on the outside of her clothes. I feel down by her pubic hair. We are waiting to cross Last Avenue. She is holding my penis, which is going between my legs and out behind me. She is holding it behind me. Cars go by. We cross quickly. We are in people's dirt yards, without grass, standing on cement. I'm walking on the cement edge of a street that is in the front yard of the white house on the left of Holt's house. I think I should deliver to Mike's garage since I am near there, but I don't. I tell my friend Beth Mock, or my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas, who is then the woman I am with, to wait. I tell her to come with me, and I run behind a farmhouse. There are horses in the area that run away. The grass is coarse pasture. I sit down next to a place where I think no windows will allow people to see us. Annie comes to me and says, "Fuck me!" I unbutton her light brown pants, which are from the 1980's, and pull them down to her ankles. We have never had sex before. I give her cunnilingus. She has an erection like a dog's erection: no penis head. She doesn't like me sucking on her erection: it doesn't feel good. Her clitoris is on the underside of her erection. I like her erection.
