I was on a train or some other conveyance that has sleeping accommodations, and I was sharing a bunk -- virtually a single bed -- with Frances Reed.  It was strange, because there was no privacy-all the beds were out in the open.  And although it seemed to be the policy to permit couples to share beds, there was a guy who kept coming around checking to see that there was no hanky-panky.  That was frustrating, but apparently I wasn't sure how Frances would react to any advances anyway, so I just lay in such a way that we were touching -- such as by having one of my legs across hers -- but I had to stiffen it in such a way as to prevent its full weight from resting on her.  Later I was going up to see Frances at Norman's apartment in New York.
