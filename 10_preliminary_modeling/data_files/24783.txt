I was in a McDonalds and I was ordering a cheeseburger and I walked into the parking lot. All of a sudden I was on Star Trek Voyager getting beamed on. I stood there shocked, not knowing what to say. I looked at my hands. They were normal. I felt my face, also normal. I was then met by Captain Janeway and Ensign Kim. They took me to my quarters and I was very happy. A little later they beamed up my parents. Setting: At a McDonalds parking lot, then Star Trek Voyager. Characters: Mom, Dad, Captain Janeway, Ensign Kim, members of the voyager. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, surprised. I was very surprised to be beamed aboard the Voyager, but I was happy to be there.
