My truck is broken. A metal thing dropped out of it. Can it be fixed? Someone, a woman, suggests I drive to class around the mountain. It takes longer, but it's a safer route with a broken truck. I think about it but decide to go straight up the mountain. I feel confident the truck can make it. I don't want to waste time going the long way.
