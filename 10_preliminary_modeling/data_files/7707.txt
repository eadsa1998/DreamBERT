The Lambert's had died and we were having a double funeral. At the wake, Mrs. Lambert opened her eyes and we realized she wasn't dead at all. I don't remember if Mr. Lambert woke up or not. Later, Mrs. Lambert appeared to be a young woman. I was defending her to some people, but I don't know who or why.
