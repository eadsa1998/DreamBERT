I dreamed I was on a pier where a ship was about to leave. Standing next to me was my husband. (a fellow who I know) (age 23). I was wearing 2 white orchids. I felt on the verge of tears. My mother was weeping bitterly. My dad and brother were sad too, but they didn't carry on so. The whistle blew. I knew it was our last chance to board the ship. I couldn't make up my mind. I looked at my mother and then at my husband trying to decide. Finally, I put my arms around my mother and kissed her good-bye. Then, I turned to my husband who put his arm around me and we slowly walked up the gangplank. At first, I tried to keep the tears back then I broke down and cried and cried.
