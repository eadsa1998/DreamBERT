My wife Bonita and I were house hunting.  We were looking at one which was being sold by a woman and her daughter, who was about 21.  We liked it, and sat down at the dining room table with the two of them to talk over the terms.  At this point the chronology becomes very confused.  Bonita sort of disappeared, and I fell for the daughter.  I had to go to the bathroom, and was directed to a room off a narrow hallway.  It looked like a barber shop-it was long and narrow, with seats on one side and mirrors on the other.  The side adjacent to the hallway was all glass; nevertheless, I was somewhat abashed that Bonita (I think) failed to shut the door when I went in.  So there I was sitting high up on a barber chair, which turned out to be a toilet seat, with my pants around my ankles, and people walking back and forth past the open door.  No one seemed to be inclined to look in, though (it was a little dark in there anyway), so I didn't want to call anyone's attention to me by calling to them and asking them to close the door.  And I couldn't get up and shut it myself, because I had half a turd hanging out.  Once I started to get up, then noticed it hanging there, and had a hard time getting it back in the toilet seat hole, which was small.  Then the daughter came in to talk to me.  At first I was embarrassed, but then I was aroused by the intimacy.  <p
