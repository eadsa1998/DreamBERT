I am on a bus. Three of us women are in charge of this baby. One woman breast feeds the baby. Two little boys get off the bus and into the elevator I'm in. One boy says to the other, as he's coming in the elevator, "Did you see those breasts!" The door shuts so that he and I are the only two in the elevator. He is red-faced with embarrassment. I want to ease his feelings, so I pretend to be deaf and ask him to tell me the floors as we go up so he'll know I'm "deaf." Now I get on the bus again. The other two women go up near the front. I go up there and say, "I knew it. No seats available up here. Just thought I'd try." I go back down the aisle a few rows and sit in a seat next to the baby. She says, "Agua," and I say, "I'm sorry. She (the other woman) forgot to bring the water." I felt sorry for her and picked her up and held her close, rocking her. She is very sweet. I am upset with the woman who forgot the water. She's up front having fun and being carefree while this baby goes without. The baby is very patient.
