I was in class, I think it was Comms. The teacher was pairing us up, but letting some people choose. The teacher asked Calvin who he'd like to pair up with, asking "Lucia?" and Calvin said "No, I want to work with [someone whose name started with 'S']". I was near Preston and Brent, and Preston went this guy who was near him. I figured Brent and I would pair up but then he moved away and I don't know what happened. Then there was an excursion? Some buses got hijacked, but ours was ok and we got off. Mom picked me up. I called Calvin and he was still at the school. As we left, I saw Eugene on the other side of the road with his hair in a ponytail and he looked like a girl. One of the bus drivers had gotten stabbed in the stomach and his name was Thomas. Then there was a house and these creepy people lived in it. One of them was Uncle Fester [Addam's Family, but not one of the actors, just some random guy] and he was sleepy? This thing chased me and there was a special way to go to get rid of it. I had to press this button and do some other things. The guy followed me and he was like made out of seaweed. The last thing I had to do was to move one of two wires to the switch and I couldn't remember which one. I asked the seaweed dude and he showed me and then I did it.
