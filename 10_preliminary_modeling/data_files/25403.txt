 I'm at my high school, Armstrong High School, taking one of my college classes, Historical Geology. The teacher is my college professor, Greg Welters. We are looking at the grades. We are lined up going into a room. There is a box of small, rounded cylinder pebbles that are painted different colors and that have designs on them. The colors and designs denote different grades. My friend from high school, Marybeth Neumann, is in front of me in line. She looks at my grade, and then says out loud that I got a C+, and that Nancy Meyer, who is a classmate of ours, is getting an A+. I don't mind that she looked at my grade, but I don't like that she said it out loud. In class, Professor Welters talks to me about something. I miss out on a sheet that he told everyone to hand in because we were talking. My high school classmate Lyle Zeffman is there. He tells me of a lake in Canada, near Los Angeles, to go fishing. It is in Quebec. <br/
