I am a young boy and am homeless. I look for a place to hide where I can be warm. I go down to the basement of a large house. I look into barrels for a place to sleep. I see a big furnace, so we'll be warm (another boy is with me). Someone is after us. Then we have to go back upstairs. I get in a pickup truck to drive and my partner is now a tiny girl on a tricycle (like a disability). I reach way down to give her a piece of paper she will need, like a deposit slip from a checkbook. She gives it back and I search the list of numbers to see if it's the right ones. She says, "Can we arrange to be away from here for two hours, because I don't want to be here when the big cloud comes?" I look over and see a devil's tower, like a volcano, and realize a poisonous or nuclear cloud will envelop this for two hours very soon. I agree and we struggle to get away from there.
