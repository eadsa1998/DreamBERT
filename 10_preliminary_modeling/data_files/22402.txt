I dreamed I was at a beach and then a group of people started to walk on the rocks, and I did too. And we arrived at a beach where one could see the bottom of the ocean. Among the people were my parents. My father went down to the shore and swam, then a boy went down quickly and he got in the water wearing a towel and all and he came out and came up fast. Then I told my father that the tide was rising and it was best to leave, so we started to climb, but in order to go up we had to climb some stairs which were very tall and narrow and they were made of tiles and slippery. I remember that at the beginning I was helping my father and when he reached the top, I was left all alone and couldn't go up, and I asked him for help and he wouldn't help me. When I got to the top some people started to get there who said they were going to play golf and that this was the private beach of a club. I went up and walked to a very small white house that belonged to an aunt of mine. There, in that house, I met two girlfriends who told me that we should go to Ancon. They looked very pretty and when I looked in the mirror, I looked terrible and all my clothes were very dirty and I told them that I couldn't go like that, and they said it didn't matter.
