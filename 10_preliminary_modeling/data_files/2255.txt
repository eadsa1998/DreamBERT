I'm in a church. Four of us are the "elders" who take the wine sacraments to the congregation. We stand facing each other in a square and bow our heads so the minister can pray over us. As he does, a beautiful angel comes and puts its wing over my shoulder and whispers to me. It is telling me I'm going to have a good relationship with the guy opposite me, a nice quiet family man. I am, of course, quite shocked to be having an angel talking to me and can't concentrate on my job. The little wine glasses jiggle and tremble and I spill wine in the tray. He helps me clean it up. As we walk back up the aisle, he helps me carry the tray so we don't spill anymore. We go to the kitchen area and pour off the spilt wine in a cup. I suggest we take it to the vestry as it is blessed wine. Then we go to the handshaking line and its too late, everyone's gone through (we are supposed to stand with the minister and shake hands with the departing people), so he starts typing a letter. I see a small 4-month-old baby. I go over and pick it up and cuddle it. An 8-year-old girl sees me and says I don't mind if she's going to be with my daddy, but she doesn't have to pick up the baby without permission! I didn't hear her and I go to the man and say, "Look at this cute baby." The man grins because it's his baby. I say, "You can hold it. I hope it isn't afraid of you. I'll finish typing the letter and you hold the baby." He agrees. As I'm typing, or trying to, the girl comes up to her daddy and says, "It's OK. I like her." He shushes her, embarrassed, and I did hear this time and now realize what's going on. He suggests we finish at his house, as he's cooking a turkey and doesn't know how, maybe I could help?
