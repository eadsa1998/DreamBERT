Our upstairs neighbor comes into my bedroom and we start to have sex; just then someone knocks at the door. Our roomer says that someone needs to use my phone in my bedroom. I rush out furious. "I am still asleep. Don't disturb me." I rush back wildly and start locking the door. Remember turning the key in the lock but it won't snap closed. I try again and again and hold the door tightly closed against the intruder. Eventually by force and patience I succeed in locking the door. I return and we spend some wonderful moments together. Ride through lovely country.
