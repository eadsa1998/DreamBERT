The dream I had really makes no sense to me. I was at a bar with a bunch of my friends both male and female. A good friend of mine (male) was teasing me and aggravating me, like he usually does, when I had the strangest urge to hit him. When I went to hit him, I could not move my hands. I forgot about this instance, and in the next scene I was in the same bar and this same kid was teasing me. Enough was enough, and I went to punch him. This time I had no hands. This continued one more time, except this last time I had only one arm and one hand. I was chasing him out of the bar and into a forest ready to punch him with my hand, making a fist, when I was awakened by my alarm.
