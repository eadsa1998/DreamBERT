I'm in a school room like in Jr. high. I'm sitting at a desk. A man sits on my right. I am trying to sell a trumpet. It's very short and has no "slide." The man and I talk about how this one is harder to play and older than most trumpets. I don't want to give it up. I go to the door of the classroom to see if Muffin Cat is around. I come back to my desk. Someone else is sitting there, another man. I know him. I walk up behind him and massage his shoulders. Larry R is sitting to my left. He is whiny and asks my assistance. He's holding a round glass that has a "face" drawn on it, like on the Kool-aid pitcher. He wants me to place his fingers so that it is in the place where the mouth is drawn. I do so. I'm annoyed at him. I chat with the 2 men. I like them. They like me.
