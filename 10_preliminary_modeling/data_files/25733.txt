 There is a Star Wars scene. I am there, with Princess Leia, a big fat man, Luke Skywalker and Han Solo. I go outside. It is cold like in the Empire Strikes Back. My friends Nate Nelling and Simon Naver are there. Nate makes a critical comment to Simon about how I always leave. I hear him say this. Simon knows I heard it. I am wearing a wife beater, walking outside. It is winter. I talk to my roommate Stephen Ramos. He tells me that my high school friend Holly Ball is jealous that I talk to my classmate Carrie Held.
