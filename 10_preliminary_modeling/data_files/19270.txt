I was at some sort of school activity, some sort of game, basketball or volleyball. I was walking up to the very top of the bleachers and sat next to my ex-boy friend. He told me about himself and his new girl friend, and I felt happy for him. Then he told me he cheated on her. I was surprised. The bad thing is, he told me he had an affair with another boy from our school, a really big, fat boy.
