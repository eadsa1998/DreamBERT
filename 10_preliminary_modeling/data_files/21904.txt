I was at Grandma's house. Denny Carter and his wife were there. They had two daughters. One was walking and the other one was still small and in a buggy. The walking one went to the buggy and I was afraid it would harm the small one by scratching the eyes for face, but she just looked at it and went on walking. There was a big fly in the house. I got the fly swatter and hit the big fly and knocked it down on the floor. There were a lot of small flies on the floor, so I was swatting them all. We had two trees in the kitchen. My brother Steve said, "Looks like one of them moved a little to the falling stage." I looked and sure enough, down it came. Then sometime later the other tree came down also. It hit the window, broke the panes, then when the top of the tree went thru the window as the top hit the ground, it flopped over and landed on the neighbor's driveway. To my surprise, the trees were about 40 ft. high and still they were supposed to be growing in my mother's kitchen and the ceiling is only 9 ft. high. I went outside and looked at the tree. It lay on the neighbor's driveway. I thought of calling the press and have a photographer come and take a picture of it. It was an unusual freak of work. I was looking at a neighbor's name plate on his house and it was Buick.
