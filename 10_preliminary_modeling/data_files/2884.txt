I want to talk with a sheep who lays down like she wants her tummy rubbed like Fluffy. A sheep dog/wolf keeps moving in between us to prevent us from talking. I decide to respect the dogs obvious wishes because I don't want to get hurt. Later, the dog says, "Oh, I guess you really aren't done talking yet," and moves aside so we can talk. I thank her.
