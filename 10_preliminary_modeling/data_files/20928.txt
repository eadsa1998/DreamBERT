We bought a large old house. The trap under the sink upstairs was leaking and the water came down over the downstairs window. I said, "I will have to fix that up." I didn't like the house. Neither did Ann. The kids played outside. Then we found them outside. A tenant was washing the window on the 3rd floor. We yelled at her to be careful and not fall. I saw a lot of scorpions in boxes beside the house. Ray Kucera said Johnstown. I went to the dime store with Ann. I had an air gun rifle and was going out for target practice.
