I had a strange dream within a dream kind of thing last night. I guess I was doing psych research or something with this boy and his mother, but there dreams were so real that they would wake up and have things fro the dream. I went into the boy's dream and he was remembering when his father was riding a horse and had really scared him (the little boy). I can't remember the mom's dream, but it was something more related to my life. It was scary for those dreams to be so real, even though they weren't mine. And I had to get out of their dreams first before I could get out of my own dream. I had to consciously wake myself up.
