I am baby sitting a cute, active 3 year old. As he runs off I say, "That's why I do not care to sit with this age. Younger ones stay put, older ones you need not watch so close." Child disappears. I start searching. See him talking with a man who is entertaining him. A couple of women with a little girl of 2 1/2 in a pink dress tagging them and limping. I ask, "What's the matter?" She points to left foot, "It hurts." I start to remove shoe and sock and children crowd around. As I bare her foot they exclaim, "No wonder" for there is a white swollen blister at the side of the sole. I say, "I'll take her home and phone Queen Elizabeth" for it's her little daughter. I wonder if it would be better to stay with her and send the message by some one else.
