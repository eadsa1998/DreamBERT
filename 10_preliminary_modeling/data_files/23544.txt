I overheard my boss at work talking that they needed to hire a new receptionist (that's my job) who's exactly 24 years old. They said I was too old, "not good enough." I got an anxiety attack -- wondering if I was fired or what? No one would tell me anything. They just kept repeating the age 24 (I'm 32).
