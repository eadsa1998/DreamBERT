A large group of friends -- maybe a dozen or so -- and I enter a pub or inn in a small cottage. The building is very old, and the pub is reminiscent of Medieval England.  We seat ourselves in a stuffy room at a long rectangular table made of a very sturdy wood and covered by a thin tablecloth. One end of the table is near a stained-glass window which shines colored light in an otherwise dimly lit environment. In the next room is a kitchen where much cooking is occuring. I have a vague notion of pizzas being prepared for our group as we sit around drinking beers from large mugs and making a lot of noise. Since it is a medieval- style establishment, there are certainly no modern inventions, such as television, around. Someone asks, "Did you bring the TV? You have to bring your own here." Another person produces a portable set and places it on a tall bench near the end of the table. The group goes crazy and starts chanting, "Pella-vision! Pella-vision! Pella-vision!", emphasizing each syllable equally. The word is understood to mean a television brought into the pub by its patrons for the purpose of entertainment. As the dream ends, I am caught up in the frenzy of my friends as we eagerly anticipate watching some program on the tube.
