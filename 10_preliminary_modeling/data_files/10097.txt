At Church: Father Andrew explains the Youth program to us; different youth leaders have different talents, one can sing, the other can paint.... We are reminded to turn in all things we have borrowed; I turn in two baby sweaters and a pair of pants, because my child had had an accident... I wonder if I might convert my bracelets into cash?
