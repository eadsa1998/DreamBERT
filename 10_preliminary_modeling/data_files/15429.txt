Bryson had heard me talking about the list of movies I was working on and he decided he wanted to do it too. Aunt Sally had made a spreadsheet which had all of us so we could input our details. Nathaniel was dissing Bryson and Braden in a room and then turned to me and said "your body is overweight" and I said "only 5kg" [actually, it's about 10kg, but I was lying] and Braden was like "6" and I said "5" and then "I'm on a diet and am still losing weight, so that's good". Then I was watching TV. There was a movie called 'I Killed [name]'. Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones and Shaun Micallef were in it. The police chased Micallef out to a car and he was talking to the NAV system to tell it where to go as the cops just stood outside the car.
