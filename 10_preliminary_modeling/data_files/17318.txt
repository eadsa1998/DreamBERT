My boyfriend Jeremy and I were to stay...in a store.  A couple ran it, and they were having a grand opening.  We were their first customers, going to try out a bedroom set.  I went to the bathroom and found the woman in there.  I hesitated pulling my pants down to go pee.  I started, and the woman saw I had black pants underneath.  She commented about it, but it seemed to make her happy.  She asked me something of the timing of a 7-course meal and it being 8 o'clock.  She was extremely happy and wanted to treat Jeremy and I to it for being the first customers.  This of course made me nervous.  Then she told me the rules to our stay.  No chocolate.  I don't remember the other two rules.  At some point she found out I was vegetarian and took that into account in her cooking.  What she ended up bringing me was a sort of vegetarian stew.  It was very good.  I tempted her to try some.  She picked out a lot of broccoli.  She spit some of it back- she didn't like it.  Then we were in the forest.  Going down from one place, there were pictures on the wall.  I was told one of them was worth quite a bit if we could pick it out.  We couldn't choose our own speed of descent, however.  So we took the next path.  There were several groups and what looked like three trails.  We passed one group with my friend Neil Block and his father Jerry.  We went up one trail, and it lead back around to the main.  Rejoining the group, I led the way to the third trail.  I ended up behind, though.  When I went to catch up, I ran through some weeds that whipped my legs.  I made some comment, and the guide laughed at me and told me I was supposed to have jumped over.  Hard to do when you can't see.  I took some of the weeds and whipped her legs, and asked her if it was so funny while her own legs were bloody.  Someone else had blood all over the bottoms of their shoes. <br/
