I was in a bedroom. Aunt Marie came my way. I walked towards her and she kissed me and she hung on. It was pretty good. We walked into a room where Bob was sleeping. Someone yelled, "Fire!" and Marie ran up to Bob and jerked him out of bed yelling fire. She frightened Bob. I said, "Take it easy," so she let him go. I told Bob Marie was excited, that's why she yelled. I said to take it easy. I will take you there, no hurry. I picked him up and he stood up on the floor nude. I wound a blanket around him and then I awoke Audrey and I took them downstairs. It was a hotel or apartment we were in. I heard bells ringing like a phone. I was dreaming I saw or was watching war. I saw a soldier throw a bomb in front of an engine and it was a dud. It didn't go off. I was throwing glass on top of a 3 or 4 story building. Some of it wouldn't reach and came back down and broke.
