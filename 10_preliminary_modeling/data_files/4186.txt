["On vacation with Howard."] I am on vacation at some motel. Kids are there. Paulina and Maren and another woman friend. We are in our rooms waiting for Howard and her husband to return. I suddenly realize that Howard left several days ago. I hadn't missed him at all. But today is the end of the vacation and we are packing to go home. Where is Howard? Did he leave me? And where is the car? How am I to get home? Then Howard and the other husband rush in full of excuses as to why they were gone so long. I interrupt him saying I don't care that you were gone, it's just that I need to know when you plan on returning and stuff so I can make my plans. I realize that sounded unfeeling and I see his face. He feels a bit hurt. I feel badly about hurting him, but facts are facts.
