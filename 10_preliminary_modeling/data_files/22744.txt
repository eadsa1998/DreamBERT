I dreamt that my mother had missed her train. All around her there were platforms with Peruvian craft items on them, but everything was on a dark background (as in the previous one). The trip she had to make was from Huancayo to Lima. I think I dreamt this because I am going to take a trip to that place. Then I saw myself alone on the trains going through the mountains and nothing else.
