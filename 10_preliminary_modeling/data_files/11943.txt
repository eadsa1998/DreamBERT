I knew 'Jesus' who looked exactly like Jim Caviezel. We were close. There was this place, a cemetery, where Jesus' grave was. It was hell hard to find. Anyway, these people kidnapped me and I knew them a little and they took me to the grave. They were going kill me because they didn't like Jesus or something. Anyway, the ground was shaking and no-one seemed to notice. Jesus was coming to get me.
