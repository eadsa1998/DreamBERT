I dreamt that I was going to the university, and when I was in the car, they were telling me that they had flunked me because I hadn't gone to take my exams. Suddenly I arrived and found myself in a hallway with yellow tiles and yellow walls, similar to the hallway in my house. When I arrived there, some gentlemen were telling me that it was useless, that I had to wait for the next term because no more exams were going to be given. I then said that I hadn't been able to take my tests due to a liver ailment and that this was unjust. I threatened to talk to the dean and ask him to take the matter into his hands. Then a gentleman came who started to pay attention to my requests. Then I awoke, after dreaming something else which I don't remember.
