Some guy (or guys) had killed 15 people and their murders were a mystery. Someone, a lover of this guy who had been killed, said he'd give the address of an old lady who could help to someone. I had a list of the 15 murdered people and I was not allowed to tell anyone about them. Ezra kept trying to get it. Mom was there. I said "I bet the lover is a guy" (he was gay). He was. He gave me the address on a band-aid. A lady was recording us and she had Mom's license plate recorded and had zoomed in on her computer and it was really good quality.
