I was out with some people, including Dad and the rest were adults too. It was night. Some guy had given me marijuana earlier. He asked when I was going to pay him back and I said 'you never said anything about payment, I didn't even want it' etc. Dad had given him some money before hand as well. I went home after that. Mom was there. Then I was near a forest-like park with Emery, his 'older brother' and someone else. It was still night. I can't remember what we did, but it was illegal and we saw cops coming and we all ran into the forest. I hid behind a tree, and Emery's brother hid behind another tree. The cops found Emery, then his brother and then me. They handcuffed them, but not me. I noticed my left shoe was on fire and I was stepping on it with my other foot to try and put it out, but it wouldn't go out. I don't know what happened to it though. I dropped my water bottle at the top of the hill near home. As the cop was doing something with Emery, his brother ran off. I almost went with him, but decided not to. I didn't say anything. When we went to continue walking home, the cop realized he was gone, but didn't bother looking for him. His brother came back though. Then he and Emery took off and came back again. Some people were complaining that they were naughty and having to take care of them. After I woke up (in real life), I discovered that Emery had gotten suspended for blowing up a lighter.
