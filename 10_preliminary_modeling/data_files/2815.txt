I am in C City, at a University. I see Rhonda and we talk. She walks me to my black car and I get in the back seat. There is lots of junk in there. I get out to walk her back to her house so we can chat. She suggests I lock the door (or asks if I should) and I say no or yes and say, "This is where I parked the van and it was stolen." I say, "You look tired, so I'll just stay 15 or 20 minutes." I ask her how she likes her job at University and she says she likes it. I ask her what she teaches now. She says she is teaching English Comp and several other classes and one weekend sex therapy class. We are now in her house and there are lots of windows, without curtains, very wood and glass modern. The ceiling has lots of windows too. I see two black funnel clouds in the sky and I say to her excitedly, "Tornadoes. I see tornadoes." She isn't interested and I keep pointing. They whirl around and around and then disappear back into the chimneys they came out of and then pop back out and roll around. They have sharp points on the heads; they kind of look like penises. They then speed over us and I look again and see they are a flock of large black birds, with unusual beaks and faces like owls or odd big birds. They land inside the house and hop up on a ledge or piano (black). Now they are small humans or living dolls. I help one up as he is tipping over and comment on how I like the softness of his fur. He is an Eskimo doll. He thanks me. I look over to Rhonda, now seated across the room, and see how tired and sad her face is. I say, "Are you well?" She shows me a chart and on the chart are the words "smells, vagina," and other words. It's time for me to go and one of the dolls, a minister in black, says, "Where's E City?" He is an old time man who will found a church at Fall Creek. I laugh, because I know that historic old church and I say I know the way and point, "It's straight down the road, that way." I get up to go, as I am driving that way myself.
