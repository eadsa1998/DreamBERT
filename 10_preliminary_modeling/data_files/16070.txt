Mom and Dad were having one of their long talks, and I had to get to school and I was late. It was like 8:10 in the morning, the time when we usually record in first period; in Warrior Vision [Westport High School was the Warriors, and so our show was called Warrior Vision] we usually record our show at that time. And so Mom and Dad took me to an elementary school to spend the rest of the day because that's where they started at that time..
