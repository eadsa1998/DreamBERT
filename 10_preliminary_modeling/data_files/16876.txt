There's an epidemic spreading fast across the country. It appears I'm living in temporary accommodation. Earlier on in the dream I'm in charge of distributing special protection packs, which include isolation tents and suits and special powder which needs to be spread over the hair and body. It's also advisable to stay in one place once this plague hits. I'm not sure how it spreads - possible in the wind, or by contact or mosquitos. Later on in the dream I'm trying to sterilize an empty school building to be used as a shelter. During this process I get attacked by a couple of bees which appear to be infected. Later the infection has hit, and the whole place is shut down. Everyone is wearing the suits, covered in powder and mostly in the tents. We just wait. I'm particularly worried about my children. It's not clear whether anyone has been infected or not.
