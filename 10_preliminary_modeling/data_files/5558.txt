[1997-05-17] Its night time and I'm in NY at somebody's apartment, I was lying in bed, I had Betty next to me lying on the floor and we were watching television, listening to it anyway, it was about midnight, but then it was my aunt M and she said "lets go see H" who's my cousin, "its close enough to walk, we don't have to get in the car" but my sister didn't want me to bring Betty, and there were some kids staying there and they were sleeping and I said "no I'm bringing Betty because she'll bark whenever she's away from me and she'll keep the neighbors awake" and so I took Betty with us and the only thing we had to do to get to this cousin of mine was to go out a door, turn right, go down this other driveway thing and then there was another turn and we ended up at his house and I go "well that's not far". So then we stayed there for a while and went right back home again, back to the other lady's house and we just talked. I don't remember much about the conversation. It was nice to see them, they were happy to be together.
