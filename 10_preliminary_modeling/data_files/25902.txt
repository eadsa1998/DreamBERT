 Two men are outside Carter School throwing a football around. One of them looks like my classmate from Brimson Al Livern. One man kicks the ball high in the air. I'm going to catch it, but it bounces near my feet. One of the men is my old basketball coach Gary Simms, and the other is a football coach. I tell them, "You guys taught me to block pretty well", and a I block both of them like I was a football lineman. I note that my trouble was keeping my balance. My weight would sometimes be too far forward, and when the opposing linemen dropped down to his knees, I'd fall over him.
