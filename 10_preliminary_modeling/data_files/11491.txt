I was walking in what may best be described as an empty subway tunnel although I am not familiar with such things. There were no tracks but evidence that people had been there was seen by the fact that the circular walls (of rock) had scribbling etched on them somewhat as the interior of a phone booth. The farther end was a great ways off, but I could see light in the distance. Also I could hear music. As I continued walking the sound of cascading water drowned out the music. I found that the tunnel opened into a marshland which was strewn with large rocks or boulders. I climbed upon one of the boulders, whereupon I noticed that there were several lead soldiers strewn over it. I tried to line them up in military fashion but the constant slapping of the water over the edge of the rock knocked them over. I put them in my pocket (shirt) and started for a house (which appeared unaccountably) but I seemed top heavy and stumbled and fell into the water. I seemed to spend several hours emptying my pockets of lead soldiers of which there seemed to be an inexhaustible supply.
