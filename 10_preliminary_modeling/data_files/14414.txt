Some others and I went somewhere out in nowhere. We were standing around outside. This girl had joined us. She was helpful but I didn't trust her. Some Native guys came and they threatened us and joked about how we'd get escape "get in the car and drive away". The car they referred to was rusty and didn't work. Someone then said "then the nightmare ends" and everyone realized I was daydreaming. They took us into a building. The girl left and started to cross a road and they shot her. Inside, I was writing dreams into my book. Some guys came in and they were like "hey, what's up" and seemed friendly. I was going to ask them if it was ok if they let me write all my dreams in before they killed me, but the guy gave me a huge amount of paper. It was a magazine about new inventions and stuff. There was a section about some plant and I can't remember what it did, but they realized what it was and got nervous. I pretended not to notice and realized they were growing it. I thought maybe they would leave us alive. The girl who got shot was now alive and was with them. Out the back somewhere were some cute kittens. Mom was there? Simba was also there and was trying to mate with Gizmo. I was watching something later and James Marsters was in it, and it showed how much makeup was used to make his cheeks look so sunken for Buffy. I was thinking that that was how I saw him, as Spike, rather than his other characters. Ezra bought a cigarette off a friend to try them 'again'.
