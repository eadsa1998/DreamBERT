I'm in a studio with a guy I know pretty well and a couple of other people (one's a woman, all young). He's a photographer or something and this is a kind of hidden place where they can do their own work, to experiment and try stuff out, and play. I'm a guest. Actually I've been here before, my px brought me here some time ago. He thought of it as a kind of crash pad. Now I see there's an organized group here and I'm a little sheepish about it. I don't want to tell them because they think hardly anybody knows about this place, and I don't want to disappoint them. It's morning - I think we've spent the night here.
