I was in PA in Rivertown. My dad had a high power rifle. I took an aim or pointed the rifle at a squirrel about 40 ft. away, but he was in line with some homes further away and I didn't shoot because I would hit one of the homes. We had a party or were at a party by Frank Lasko's. I brought some meat. I cut it with a very sharp knife. We stopped by Harold Hilts. He had a shop going. He had some sort of liquor. He told me to pour it into a jar, which I did. Then he told me to wire it, which I did. It foamed. Then we were putting some kind of cloth to cover the top. I was watching somebody uncover a drum and they were taking out coin money out of it. Then they covered it again. I looked thru a telescope at a straw and when I saw it, it was a small man.
