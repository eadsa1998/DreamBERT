Attending the Ellen DeGeneres TV program. She was having a contest related to painting t-shirts. I didn't want to paint on any of my t-shirts and didn't want to tell her that. But I wanted to participate in the contest. I decided to paint on my black SAID t-shirt with black paint. You could only see it if you were really looking for it, or at certain angles. You could feel it. I thought that would be unique and get her attention anyway. I used a can of spray paint, while wearing the shirt, and painted the name Ellen in large block letters on the front. I realized I would have to take it off and put it on backwards so I could paint her last name on the back of the shirt. I was sitting in the audience. The back rows had very few people sitting in them, but I was one of them. I was there alone. When it was time to leave I saw the cap to the spray paint and to my water bottle lying next to me but I couldn't find the spray paint or the water bottle.
