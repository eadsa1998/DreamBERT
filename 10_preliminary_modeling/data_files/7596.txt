I was a little girl and instead of wearing slacks, I was wearing a snow suit, just the pants. I had on a real dressy blouse. There was a ladder. It was a V-shaped ladder, you know, two ladders together and they meet at the top. There was some kind of a cart underneath it. There was a girl, someone I went to school with, and she was little too, only she was big. And the teacher was there and all the kids were playing. The girl asked me to play with her. She climbed up one side of the ladder, so I climbed up the other. If you moved the ladder (it was on wheels), the cart went through the ladder. All I remember is that I ended up sitting in the cart.
