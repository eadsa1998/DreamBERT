I was playing a game, out live. I was at a house and someone knocked on the door. It was some weird guy with a squishy head. He said he was new in the game and I told Ezra to deal with him. We were in some caves and there were patches of grass with Pokemon in them. The only one I had was Nidoran (male). A trainer battled me, but he had 3 Pokemon and it took away two, so it was fair. I did a tail whip movement and it knew what move it was and the Pokemon did it too. Later I was at a school, which was big. I was at a bench with Calvin and some others. Forrest came up to us and I asked if he'd do something for me and he said he would do it tonight. Samantha asked who it was and I giggled and said "a friend from when I was younger" and she said "he's small". I was then in a room on a computer with profiles of all the people at school. The photos had a 360Â° movement. I saw Mackenzie's one. I was editing mine as it showed my birthday as the 13 September. I was learning some American ways, ie using stuff on the opposite side. There was a ladder thing I had to climb and I had to put my left foot first which made it really hard. I was hanging on and there was a long drop below. I was scared. This guy friend of mine came to help me. There was a long queue waiting to go behind me. I was now in a muscly body and did it and everyone clapped.
