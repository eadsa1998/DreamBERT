I was taking an examination in writing letters which were to be sent to W----. My grandmother and a friend with whom I am only slightly familiar, female named C----, were in the examination. However, the city and government were so corrupt that the letters didn't get through. C---- was particularly in a state of confusion and I was struggling to get to an emergency post office of which several were set up in case important letters had to get through to W----.
