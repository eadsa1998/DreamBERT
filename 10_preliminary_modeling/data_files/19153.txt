I'm dreaming about motorcycles. It was very clear, but now I'm having trouble remembering it. There was a large group of motorcycles. I'm not sure why or where we were going or anything. I dreamt I was with a friend, Tony, and we were studying lipids and the important lipid was phosphotydyl choline. We had the structure drawn on a little blackboard in this room. For some reason this structure was important, more important than the other lipids we were drawing. My friend Al and I were on the back porch of his house putting together a motorcycle, his motorcycle, piece by piece. We put the pistons in, the rings in, the sonar head on, and we got his motorcycle all together, cooperatively, and we got it running. We took it off his back porch, took it out into the street, and we went out to race his motorcycle against my motorcycle. We were racing and then I don't remember any more of the dream. In reality my friend does have a motorcycle on his back porch, apart, and on the 12th we'll go over together and put it together and probably race. It's just an actual experience. In the dream my friend Al was wearing a red shirt. In the dream the setting of the back porch with the chairs and couch and bench press rack were seen as they actually are.
