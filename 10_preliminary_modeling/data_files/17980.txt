In a tower, my mother had just given birth to four children; two boys and two girls.  The boys had green eyes, one large and sparkling like jewels.  The girls had blue eyes, and one of them had large sparkling jewel-eyes as well.  My mother and I were discussing the names for the babies.  We were going to call one of the boys Peter, and the other started to cry.  "Alright, you can be Peter.  Not like it really matters to us," I said.  I thought of calling the other one Alex but I don't remember what was actually decided upon- it wasn't Alex.  All four of them had quite a bit of hair- much more than my brother Stuart or I had at birth, I noted.  My mother talked about feeling one of their elbows move back and forth while they were in the womb.  Somehow because of this she knew one was breech.
