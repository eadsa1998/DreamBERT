 I am with my friend Kevin in a small room with a long rectangular table. There is a television in an upper corner of the room. It is on. My classmate Ned Stallone is a security guard. He walks by, stops, and enters. He has a mask over his mouth. I think there is a disease somewhere. It may be in our room, or somewhere else. There is a boy sitting at a table with us. He's eating a huge bowl of fruit and ice cream, which came in rectangular chunks. Ned tells us to meet at 8:30 in Major Hall Dormitory.
