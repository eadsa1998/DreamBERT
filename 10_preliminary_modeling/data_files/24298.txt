Forgot about a statistics class I was taking. Nina, a college friend, student newspaper photographer, was there for some reason. She was taking the class. I said, how many tests are there? She said four. I remember only taking one, and that was a hazy memory, and one was the next day. There was also, I hoped, a final. It was too late to drop. I'd simply forgotten about the class--that I had even registered for it. I went to the classroom and had trouble finding a seat. Like that dream from Spanish class, and Chinese class, where there was an impending test and I hadn't studied a thing for it. I said to my mom, who was visiting, "I'll need to stay here -- I have a test tomorrow." Instead of going back. I asked Anabel (Nate's wife and a friend from high school) for the key to the old apartment. She had it. I stayed there. I had two desk areas set up. One upstairs, and one downstairs -- like my old room in the club hill house.
