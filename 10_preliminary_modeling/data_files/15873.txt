I was rewatching The Babadook. It was the same creature, but a different film. It started off in this creepy and dark lounge room of an apartment and there was a boy talking and a face appeared about behind the curtains and ducked behind it again. I was thinking it seemed a lot better than I remembered and was actually creepy.
