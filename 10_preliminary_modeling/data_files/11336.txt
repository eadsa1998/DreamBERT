A group of boys my age and I were playing on a large field. I suggested that we play horse and rider. Some said yes that's a good game. Then a whole lot of girls my age came onto the field. I suggested the same game again and everybody took up the suggestion. The field later turned into a dance floor. I danced with one girl and we were really enjoying ourselves. While we were dancing someone put on a record that was hard to dance to. She told me that she would like to sit this one out. The guy who was taking care of the records explained to us that he put on the wrong record by mistake. I then went behind the bar. I suggested that I go over and bring back a bulletin that stated Mr. Hall was a communist.
