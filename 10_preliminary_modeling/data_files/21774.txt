We were in radiation, atomic bombs were dropped and we were helping people who were injured. We were washing the dishes from radiation. I was checking or marking the horses that won and there were about 20 of them. I can't recall any of them clearly now. We were in our house in Rivertown and Judy was walking thru the living room and she walked thru the front door and it was dark. I looked to see if she was safe. I called her into the house and she came in.
