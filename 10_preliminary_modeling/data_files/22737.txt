I was going to have an appendectomy. The hospital was a very soft green, the room was very large, there were many people. I did not want to be operated on. There were two girls there who are very good friends of mine from the university. There was also a boy whom I detested, but I had spoken to him just yesterday. In my dream he laughed a lot and was very kind and nice. My parents were pulling me by the hands into the operating room, and I was pulling back. I dreamt all this very sharply and neatly.
