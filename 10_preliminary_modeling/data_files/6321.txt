To understand this dream you have to understand my family. In my eyes, my father's mother doesn't care about us. She never calls to see if anything's new or just to check up on us. I maybe see her 4-5 times a year and she lives in the same city as us. My mother's mother is always around and would do just about anything for us. Anyway I am at a party with my family and father's mother comes and starts bitchin' at us for no reason. I blow her off cause I'm fed up with her. My mother's mother comes and I give her all of my attention and do anything she needs. Then the dream turns to where I see my sister lying in an alley beat up. The kid who did this was a kid I don't like from the projects. My cousins and I get a hold of him in front of my house and we beat the hell out of him. When we're done and walking into my house I turn to see him gasping for breath and bleeding very badly in the middle of the street.
