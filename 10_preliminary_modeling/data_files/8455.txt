I was at my birth home. There were a lot of people there. Maybe there was a party or something going on. I had gone upstairs to use the bathroom. Someone had used it and did not flush the toilet. I thought maybe they had not flushed because they were afraid it would overflow. So I pressed the handle to flush it and then ran out of the bathroom because I didn't want to have to clean it up if it did overflow. I thought I would go back in a little while. I went outside through the back door that we always used in waking life. When I came back in a few minutes later, Mother was mopping the kitchen floor but she also had a bunch of white towels on the flower to help her mop up. The towels were all brown and nasty. I knew that the toilet had overflowed all the way out into the kitchen. She looked at me kind of mad, as though she knew what I did. I didn't want to admit it. I think I told her that I went in to use the bathroom, saw that someone had not flushed it, so I flushed it and left. I don't think I told her the rest.
