I was in class, but it kept changing. I sat next to Calvin and Vivienne. Harlan sat in front of me. Something happened and we got into a fight. Harlan left angrily. I didn't get in trouble but ended up with a sore lip. I was at a basketball court. Elijah was running. This teacher guy said I had to go back to his house. When I was there, I read a magazine. I was then at school again and Harlan was back in class. He wasn't turning around and Vivienne said "Don't worry, she doesn't care, she's not going to hurt you!" Vivienne had been gay before by not letting me sit in my seat.
