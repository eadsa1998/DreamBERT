["Competition then deliberate ruin."] I am on a football team of women. We are playing a team of men. We play hard and well surprising the men. We actually win, Now the two teams are lined up facing each other to shake hands and congratulate each other. The male captain tells us we have only 25 minutes to do the individual handshaking and remarks to each player on the other team. Our captain, like Captain Janeway, is supposed to tell the team members but she strangely wanders away suddenly. I as the second officer walk down the line and repeat to each player the news. Then I see that the Captain is in a small runabout space craft. She is recklessly driving around. Then she drives out toward space and crashes on a space station. I see flames billow up. This is so odd for her. Now Worf is suddenly taken over by a need to drive the silly slow and monotonous race cars that look like soap box derby cars at a reckless pace. He causes an accident. I am putting slowly in my blue car and see it, Now the police take him and me to jail. Somehow I get out of my cell and walk outside to the city street. I see that the door to the police station which had had the sign "Police" on it when we went in the first time now has a sign that says The Mind. I realize then that we are on another planet and the aliens are making us do these reckless actions and observing us. I go back inside to see Worf is out of his cell. I call attention to the desk officer that we are out of our cells. We walk around looking the place over, not worried about being caught or harmed. Now that I know, they have no power over me.
