 I'm in my room in bed. I wake up and there are four spirits in my room. I think they might be angels or ghosts. One is standing near the closet. It is a tall male with side burns. It is my friend Stephen. Next to him in another spirit, who is a shorter female spirit with long dark hair. It is my classmate Lexi Mondragon. There is a spirit lying on the floor that might be sleeping. I don't know more about it. The fourth spirit is small and is hovering in the air. I try to talk to the spirits; to communicate. They don't respond. I speak directly at the Stephen and the Lexi spirit, saying their name and my characteristic noise: "Grrrrrr!" I throw a pillow at them. It goes through the Stephen spirit. His physical apparition then disappears and the clothes that he was wearing then stand empty. His body reappears in five seconds. I ask the holy light of god to surround and protect me. I try to stand up and walk. I am very shaky and my vision is blurred. I sit down. I awaken in the dream, and am nearly lucid. The figures fade momentarily, and then return as I drift back into a lucid state. I can feel myself speaking, trying to get the attention of the spirits. I am in a pre-lucid state. I awaken, and think I should have asked the spirits who they were and what their purpose was.
