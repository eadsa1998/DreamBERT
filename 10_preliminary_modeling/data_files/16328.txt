My white chocolate candies and my chocolate covered cherries came in from Melinda's fundraiser, and I dreamt that Samantha and Sandra and Derek were in town, and that Samantha was supposed to pick them up from Mrs. Hollander's room for me and she did, and she like got herself an extra set. Well, I find out that Samantha has a dog and she's just giving my white chocolate bunnies to the dog like dog food treats. And I was so mad because those were supposed to be for us to eat, and here she's giving them to a dog! And here I paid $7 for those suckers. [laugh] And I can't remember too much more.
