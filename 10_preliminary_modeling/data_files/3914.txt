["Crawling up the hard way."] I am walking down a street. A man is watching me. I think he is attracted to me. The street is full of debris and potholes. I am walking toward a big freeway that intersects the street. Thousands of vehicles rushing past. I am worried about how to cross safely. A dump truck backs up toward us and is beginning to lift up the dump part to loose all the debris into the street, right where I would cross. Another man darts ahead and I now try to cross rapidly before I am buried alive under garbage and junk. But no matter now hard I try to go fast, I can barely move. I am lying on the street clawing my way trying to crawl, but still barely moving. I am afraid the dump truck will dumps its stuff on me. But I somehow persevere and make it across now I'm standing and trying to run. It's like we in an underpass. I decide at the last moment to climb up to the next level on a cement pole with metal foot rests in it like a ladder. I scramble to the top and crawl over a chain link fence only to be encountered by a stone faced cop. I made it this far and I can see life is so much better here so I aggressively stare him down and tell him to leave me alone. He does. I go on, moving normally.
