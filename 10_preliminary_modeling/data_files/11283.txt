I was riding down Hough Ave. near east 75th St. with Phil Harris, the famous star of movie and radio fame. As we stopped at the corner signal, Alice Faye, Harris' blond wife passed in front of us. Both of them smiled at each other in recognition and launched a snappy, humorous dialogue that is so characteristic of their weekly radio programs. I recalled a distinct sense of awe as I marveled at their keen wit and sense of humor.
