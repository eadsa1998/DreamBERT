I was at Mom's and I was in her room. I looked out the window and saw these people coming out of a car, two women. I knew they were bad and I went into my room to hide, but the daughter of the two, who looked like the one from that gay Mayhem movie, checked all the rooms and found me. I can't remember properly, but they took our stuff, including my phone, all our phones, but the young one gave me a phone, for some reason. She kept calling me and teasing me because she had my phone. Mom and I went to the car and they had pulled it apart taking stuff, although one part of her car they didn't check and it had one of Mom's phones, so they hadn't found it. The people came back and I was complaining because they took my phone and she ended up giving it back to me.
