[Eyes really sore again.] I go to see Dr. M. about eyes. To my surprise, although it was Saturday, not many were waiting. He says it is the kerato-junction again and he puts a rubber sponge over left eye under glasses to shut out the light and ties it on with a large white triangular bandage. I start home along Beretania Street but the bandage flops so I fear it will become too loose. [Had had this trouble soon after operation.]
