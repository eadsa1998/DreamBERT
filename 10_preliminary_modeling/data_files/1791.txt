I am watching a performance by a bright and spangly-dressed performer. I get bored and decide to leave. I go out in the lobby area. A mentally retarded man asks where's the lady with the magic that turns the lights on for him? I say, "She's still performing. You'll have to wait." I push him away as he's trying to hug me. I go out to look for the car. Someone parked it far away. It looks like Dovre's car. I get in, the passenger side. I can't get the safety belt to work. We can't go until it does work. I am frustrated. Some one from the back seat tries it. I get sarcastic. Finally, it works and we can go home.
