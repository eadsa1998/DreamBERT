I am having a bowel movement, after being constipated for a while. I squat over a hibachi thing next to the toilet and push. A hard piece comes out. It falls and gets on the carpet. Some more follow and now I have to pick them up and put them in the toilet. Charla comes by, eating a roll, and she thinks this will be fun and picks up some of the round balls of shit to help me. I say, "Oh no! put that down. Don't touch the roll now. Go wash your hands and don't put them in your mouth." I get up to walk her to a place she can wash her hands when the toilet starts acting strange like it's going to overflow. We back away. It disgorges lots of shit and water noisily like an agitated washing machine gone mad. I go grab a telephone, but the line is dead, so I go out into the hall down to the next classroom and say to some people working in there, "The toilet is overflowing, and the telephone doesn't work. This is an emergency." Several of the men come following me back to where the toilet is. Joe K from the community college is right behind me. I say, "There it is," only it's perfectly quiet now, but it has moved to another spot. How can it do that? I say, "Look out, there's lots of shit around." He laughs and says, "There sure is!" "It stinks," I say. He agrees cheerfully. He then decides to flush it to see if it still does it. It rumbles and we back away and soon muddy brown water is being thrown out. More stinky shit! Now I'm backed to the entrance door and Tyler and others join us. I say, "What a metaphor! I can throw a lot of shit and it won't hurt, just stink! and the phone doesn't work either." Tyler and I smile at the wonderful metaphors.
