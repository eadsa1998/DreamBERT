I am in a hotel room with a lot of beds. I find out the cast of Saved By the Bell is sleeping there, and somebody tells me not to sleep on those beds. Then, I thought I heard a TV character coming to tell me I was on his bed. I never saw him, but I assumed it was him. I saw two girls I know on the first two beds on the left. Each of them had a cat who seemed like he'd sleep right by her side the whole night. I saw my grandfather's cat, Doc, except I think it might be Laura's cat. Somebody had turned music up to blaring levels. I felt bad for Doc for having to put up with such loud noise. Then three adults in the room started smoking. (I saw Miss Mitchell there too, but she didn't seem to mind). I tried to get away from the smoke, and I wanted to tell Mr. Dell (I assumed it was another school trip, I suppose) that I can't stand the smoke and ask if I could sleep somewhere else.
