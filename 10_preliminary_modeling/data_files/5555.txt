[1997-05-16] I was on the telephone with a person named T who is a supermarket guy who takes the orders for me when I call up to put my order in for the week, because they deliver and he was playing an organ and he wanted me to play mine so he could hear mine and I said "wait a minute" and I went over to the organ that I have at home and I was doing the different stops that it has with my left hand, and I couldn't get it to sound the way I had hoped it would , I was going for a particular vibrato and it wasn't going to that sound and I was getting frustrated because I couldn't get it to go to that certain sound quality that I was going for.
