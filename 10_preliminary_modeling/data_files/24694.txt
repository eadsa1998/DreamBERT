I was in the car with Bianca and Nicole. I don't remember how we got there. We were trying to get to the bus. We started to drive up. Oh, no! Bianca couldn't find the brakes. The bus pulled up (at the top it shows what happened). We still didn't know how to use the brakes. We went around the bus and had to go back down the hill. Suddenly, I saw the brakes and I told Nicole to take my seat. Oh, no! We were heading into fog. How do you turn the lights on! Then I remember we got to the bottom. I think someone broke their ankle, but I can't remember who. Setting: In the car. Characters: Bianca and Nicole are good friends of mine. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, worried. I was scared and worried the car would crash.
