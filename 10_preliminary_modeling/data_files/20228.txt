I was looking for a new way to go to where I worked. I took a bus. I had to get off and transfer to another bus. When I got off the bus to transfer, strange buildings were all around. I went to a restroom to urinate. A woman who looked familiar told me. I was in the wrong restroom. I hurried to catch my bus. It was gone, so I decided to walk. I knew I was late.
