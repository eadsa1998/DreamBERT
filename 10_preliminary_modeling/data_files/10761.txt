I dreamed that a friend of mine, Lois Watkins (20), and I were working in physiology lab on a cadaver. We were working specifically on the stomach of this male cadaver, trying to find red beads in his kidney. I remember that we were the only ones who were unable to find the red beads, and at last our lab instructor (a young fellow, about 20-25, whom I don't know) came over to help us. He held the cadaver upright in a sitting position while we hunted. Here my dream seemed to end, or at least I don't remember any more of it. I do remember us probing around for the red beads, however, and at last we saw them, but didn't move them as other members in the class did. I also remember that we were working at the last lab table and that our cadaver was very limp and his hands, feet and face were not covered as the cadavers in medical school are. Our cadaver was a young, nice-looking (about 20), blond man and looked more as if he were just sleeping and not dead at all. I remember being a little frightened at the thought of seeing the cadaver for the first time, and then surprised at finding him looking so natural and not finding his hands, feet and face bound up. Lois and I also thought it was funny and laughed a good deal at being the only members in the class who couldn't find the red beads.
