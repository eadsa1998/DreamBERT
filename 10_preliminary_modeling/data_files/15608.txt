There was a new season of Castle. Castle and Beckett were acting the same as normal but she was flirtier. They were investigating a crime scene and she flicked her hair while Castle wasn't looking. The case was weird. She was calling him Henry at one point and he got really annoyed. There was a teen called John Huston and had an Aussie accent. He was cute. They were at a highschool/university where he was in an acting class. He was a suspect, but he was nice. Later, there was a video hologram thing of him dancing. Beckett moved to parts of the room so it looked like she was dancing with him. She got out and found Castle. He had a twin but they weren't identical, just very similar, so that was how he managed to do whatever he did. Beckett found an old Castle interview where his alias was Henry and that was where she'd gotten it from.
