I dreamed that the communists invaded Berea and that they had all the people out in a big field in a big long line. It was very cold outside and I can just see the faces on those Chinese soldiers. They were unshaven and smelled filthy dirty. Then we were told to take all of our jewelry except they didn't want our watches. I remember my mother taking off her diamonds and the sad look on her face. I remember taking off an old ring and I asked the soldier why he wanted that old ring for and he slapped me across the face and took the ring and walked away. Then I woke up.
