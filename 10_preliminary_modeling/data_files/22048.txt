I arrive at the "El Dorado" building and I am afraid to go up the elevator. I stopped in front of the elevators for a moment while I saw with fear that the people were going up and down. Then I decided to go to the seventh floor up the stairs. There I talked to a middle-aged gentleman in a waiting room. Suddenly a feeling of uncertainty and a strong inkling of a tremor enveloped all of us. I hurriedly went down to the first floor. There I found my spiritual father and we talked in his office. He is my spiritual director and was somewhat angry.
