I am with a large group of people and we are visiting a resort town. I am tired and want to rest before going to the casinos. I am in a large, open field and lie down to rest, either on a cot, or on the ground. All of the people in my group are nearby, in another large field. They promise to wait until after I have had my rest when we'd all go together to the casinos. When I awaken after resting, I'm clad only in my underwear shorts. I go to the other field only to discover that my friends are gone. I'm very upset. But some other people tell me not to worry, that my friends will return soon. This calms me down. I look into the field and see a small ditch in which Mary is sitting, or kneeling. I see her face in profile and she is smiling. She is not looking directly at me.  To get a better view of her, I kneel down beside Mary. The dream ends.
