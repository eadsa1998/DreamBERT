In some kind of building that wasn't familiar. The people in it were mostly new, about my age, and I didn't know them. My feelings during this dream were mostly pleasant. From what I can remember I was punching and shooting other men, and they were dying. There was a woman fighting with me. I didn't know her. It was an all-out fight, but in the end I was standing.
