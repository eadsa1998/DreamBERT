["The baby and the hamster."] I am holding a large guinea pig or hamster in a football hold in my left arm and a baby in the same hold in my right arm. I am seated on the very edge of a ledge that looks straight down a long distance to the ocean. I see some movie stars standing on another ledge several stories down. I see several people swimming in the ocean in black sleek wet suits. I pull back, afraid I will slip and fall. I also lay the baby and hamster further away from the edge so they won't be in danger. I realize that the woman who owns these creatures has secreted a message somewhere on the hamster. I think that is clever.
