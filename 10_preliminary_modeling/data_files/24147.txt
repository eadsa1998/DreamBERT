I'm pregnant. I know that I have to give birth at 5:30 in the evening. I'm sitting on the toilet going to the bathroom. Some blood comes out too. I suddenly realize that I'm late. I rush to finish, then run down the hall to the room where I'm supposed to give birth. I'm about to begin when my best female friend/lover rushes into the room after a long day of studying and classes. (I wasn't sure she even knew about the birth. I thought she was too busy.) She says something like "I'll be here, it will be like we're giving birth together. You're not doing it alone."
