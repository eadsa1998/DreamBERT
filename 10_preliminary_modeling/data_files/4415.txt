["Want me pills."] I am in a room. I am putting gum drop candies in a line. I am eating them, also enjoying the different colors and flavors. I am typing with an old fashioned typewriter the letters Want Me, one letter on each candy. There are people who will be doing a ritual over these candies and then I will eat them so the spell works. I pick up a handful of them. I show them to a Doctor. They look like necco candies now round like pills. I ask him if I will overdose eating so many. And make myself ill. He says no, it is safe. So I put them in my mouth and eat them, trying to concentrate on the words and the mantra. I want the spell to work, because then I will have a loving relationship. Someone will love me.
