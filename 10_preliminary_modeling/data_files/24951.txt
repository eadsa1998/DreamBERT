 There is a squirrel on a flat surface. It is moving in a small semicircle-like path, less than a couple feet in diameter. There is a point on the back of the squirrel's neck that I am trying to stag with a needle-like rod. The squirrel moves, and then stops, and then moves again. I stab it when it stops.
