I was at Jeff's house on Seabright in Santa Cruz.  At the back of the house, the floor was gone.  He had redone the kitchen, widened it, and put more appliances in there, all lined up along the back wall.  But I was worried about the landlord and the back door being gone, and the floor being up (gone).  It was kind of dangerous with no floor boards.  You had to jump off the roof on to the ground out back, to get outside the back door.  The steps were gone.  Another part of the dream, I was at a school very much like Sarah Lawrence.  There were a lot of women, very smart women, a lot of expectations.  I let one of the girls' (something) almost float down the sink, through the top overflow drain.  It was like a small piece of leather, or something that floats.  I stopped it before it went through the drain.
