For some reason of other, the sink needed priming instead of the pump, in the kitchen sink. And for some reason we needed to run this great big hose from the pump outside into the kitchen, and we had to, instead of having the sink spray into the hose to prime the pump, we had to have the hose spray into the sink to prime the sink. And then, after spraying the hose into the sink faucet for a while, we had to spray the hose down into the garbage disposal and run the garbage disposal for a while. And it made the most horrible, horrible sound and it was the most horrible feeling to me. And somehow I had the notion that this had to be done because I like stayed too long at a party and left the sink running while I was gone or something stupid like that. And it made a sound that really scared me, and I was pretty sure, when I think about it now, I'm pretty sure I've heard it somewhere, but I don't know where. So I know there was more to it, but I can't remember now. That was kind of stupid.
