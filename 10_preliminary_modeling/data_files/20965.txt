Julia Gibson had a pair of trunks on and she showed a man a long dagger she carried. Bud told her if anyone got funny with her, she should run it thru him. A gang of fellows came over and they were feeling pretty drunk. One man sat by the table and I thought I was going to get some money. He mentioned Steve and then $30. Someone came over and it was to be a secret, so we went into a bedroom and there it was, $60. A new church was mentioned.
