["Van is stolen."] Dovre and I are talking on a cell phone. I am standing outside near a freeway. I am trying to return home from S City. She asks where the van is and I look and see that Michael K. (new dreamer in group) is stealing it. He turns right onto the freeway, the opposite direction I need to go to get home. I try and run after him, calling out, stop. Hey. He stole my van. I turn left and run down a rutted dirt path. It is hard to keep up the pace. I am growing tired.
