I was in London with a friend. Stephen Merchant and Ricky Gervais were doing some live show nearby that we were going to go buy tickets for. The place it was being held at was just around the corner. We went to a cafe and was looking at the different chocolate drinks when I saw Stephen Merchant walking into the store. I squee'd to my friend and tried to keep my cool. I picked a drink with Oreos and they made my friend's drink and then Stephen just held up a bag of bread and water bottles and handed the money over to the guy. It was really rude and I was a bit disappointed. I got my drink but it wasn't as nice as I expected. I walked around the corner I saw Stephen go around and he was at a door a fair way down but he turned and looked in my direction and I turned and went away.
