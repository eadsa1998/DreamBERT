It felt as though I woke up, sat up in my bed, saw three tables sitting to my left, gave some thought to the things that were sitting on them, and then laid down and went back to sleep. This happened more than once. [I don't have three tables sitting to the left of my bed in waking life. I don't know if I woke up to any degree and can't say with any certainty if I sat up in bed or not.] Later, someone came in and talked to me. I was in a room on a cruise ship setting up displays for fifteen SAID stores. I had three, square tables sitting in a row along the wall. Each had just a few things sitting on them. Each table was a different store. I needed to determine the best layout in this room to set up the fifteen tables.
