 I'm studying Cellular/Molecular Biology with my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas. I'm paging through the textbook asking her questions to help her prepare for a test. I ask what kind of filament is being used in each of the cell process, including locomotion, mitosis, and others. We look in the textbook for the panel 17-1, which outlines the steps of mitosis.
