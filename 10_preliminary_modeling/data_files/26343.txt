 I'm riding in a car with my sister Heather, who is driving the car. We talk about her dog, and she says that she doesn't like to feed him lunch! I'm appalled and demand to know why. I say to her, "You feed yourself lunch, what about your dog?" She says feeding a dog is different, and it's okay not to feed a dog lunch. I consider dogs and humans to have an equal need for lunch. We pull up next to a liquor store and go inside. When I go in the store a man gets right up in my face and talks to me. I have trouble walking, and I walk slowly. My left knee and leg drags along. A man may touch my knee, and there seems to be nothing functionally wrong with it. There is a meat-and-cheese party. Many upper-class people are there. They are ignorant people. I think the party is very foolish.
