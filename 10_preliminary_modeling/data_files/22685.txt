I was in a boat full of Chinese, and I had to carry a small baby whose mother was Chinese. The mother had stolen him somewhere and I was helping her. The baby did not move or cry, but he didn't seem to be dead. He seemed more like a doll. Then I saw myself involved in a chase. They were chasing me and the Chinese lady was with me and the baby too. I don't know if they caught us or what happened to the woman and the baby. The Chinese woman did not speak. The only one who spoke or thought was I, and I was in a big dilemma because I felt anguished and I didn't know what to do with the baby. At several points I felt that the creature was going to slip from my arms like a fish. At other times I felt I was carrying a rectangular piece of wood of the same size as the baby, wrapped in a small blanket that I have from when I was small. In the chase I ran and carried the baby like a package. I constantly tried to get away through narrow stairs like the ones they have on ships. It seems to me that the boat was one of those used by the pirate Drake.
