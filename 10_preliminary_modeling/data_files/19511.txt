Standing in doorway is a faultlessly dressed (brown suit) man, dark skinned, black eyed, black haired. Reminded on of an Indian prince. Across the room Gladys and some unrecognized person are talking, with her back toward the doorway. The Indian remains in the doorway several minutes, as he evidently does not care to do his stunt until everyone stops whatever they are doing and watch him. Presently he walks briskly across room to blackboard, and now Gladys and companion have turned around to watch him. At first it seems he plans to hold a contest to determine who can draw, from memory, the most accurate map of the United States. Nothing comes of this however, and the Indian picks up a piece of chalk and, working with extreme speed, almost instantly has rough outlines of U.S. and Southern Canada drawn (he is now known to be a professional speed artist, similar to those who paint pictures in a few minutes). His method of drawing is very peculiar. In the beginning he makes a few dots, or short lines, scattered in an apparently aimless fashion over the entire country. Then he connects some of the dots with straight lines and soon the outlines of several of the states are shown. When finished, the map still shows only a partial outline of many states.
