This girl got kidnapped by two guys and I think she sort of knew one of them. What had happened was he had asked her to lock up as he was going out for cigarettes. When she got to the door, she heard another voice. She tried to lock the door but it wasn't working. The other guy was Ted Bundy, although it didn't look like him. There was a recording of him killing her and him talking about stuff. The other guy was called Thomas, I think. Then I was at Nana's. I was reading about it on the net but icons weren't showing and Ezra thought something was wrong, but then it worked. Nana and some lady kept saying to me stuff like 'it's ok', thinking that I was scared by it. I got sick of it and went out and I said "Ted Bundy's my favourite serial killer" and said I've read everything about him etc. Nana had this look on her face but I didn't know what it meant.
