I'm in an art supplies shop, or perhaps a cake shop or a cafe. Perhaps I'm in a european country like Italy. I'm an art student I think. There's a female student in the shop who is very upset about something personal - I can't recall what. Outside the shop she is crying. I feel sorry for her, so I put my arm around her to comfort her. At that moment, my partner comes down the road with her sister) and sees us. She is furious, suspecting something. I protest but it's no good - she storms off. Later, or in a separate dream, I'm working late at my studio (at the university). Now perhaps we are in Edinburgh. My studio is quite large - with a high ceiling but no windows. I'm running behind on my project. I have a couple of abstract looking drawings pinned to the wall. I realize the dean of the college is Francis Bacon, and he is coming over with the head of the course to crit the work. They come into my studio. It isn't bacon - but it is someone well known. They say very little, and I feel awkward. My friend Terry comes in after the other have left. He wants to go for a drink. He's excited about the course. I haven't finished work, but I feel pressured to go, so we go.
