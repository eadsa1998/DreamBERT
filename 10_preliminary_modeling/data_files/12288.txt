Samantha, Calvin, Silas and I were somewhere. Dad and Ezra were there too. I think we were outside of town. I was at this place like a Roman place and I was having a bath. I dropped a jumper in it. This guy was playing music and he said that it would be the "last piece of music you'll hear for a year". There was a sign-in book at this place and it had been signed by me already and I signed again. Silas was on a little cart and was driving it. It had controls which went the opposite way they were supposed to. He almost ran over this hedgehog and got in trouble so I drove instead. I was in front of him before though (you drove from the back). Then I was at an airport and Dad was AWOL and we couldn't get the ticket. Somehow we were then at the airport (or so I thought) and I saw Daryl and his brother Dewey. Samantha and Calvin found stuff that I'd written that said "I love" and had Simon Pegg, Ryan Cartwright and a lot more people's initials. They thought something also said Zander, though it said MP (Michael Palin), which I was thinking said AL. Samantha said I was a 'little' obsessed. Daryl and Dewey were talking about me. Daryl had a piercing so I decided I didn't like him anymore.
