I was in Vietnam firing at Americans on the ground from a tall 3- to 5-story wooden structure--not sure if Americans thought it was American or Vietnam. I hated them because they were rich and cruel. Suddenly, they took off in a helicopter and hovered near my window I had fired out of. I looked into the 'copter and saw about six male faces, stern and cruel, battle clothes, most without helmets. I felt they could fire or napalm me with ease. They hovered and hesitated even longer. Should I toss a hand-grenade in or hide under a bed? Dream stopped. No resolution.
