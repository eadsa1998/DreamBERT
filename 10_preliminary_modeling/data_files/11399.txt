I was in a gym, running around and jumping. Suddenly I ran into a small boy about 3 or 4 years old. My knee hit his mouth and a tooth of his was broken. He started to cry and I picked him up to soothe him. His parents came up and I paid them for the dental work that I guessed had to be done (there probably would be none, but I still gave them money). Later I found out that one of my front teeth was loosened and would have to be removed. My aunt (30) and uncle (33) came with me to a dentist and it was done.
