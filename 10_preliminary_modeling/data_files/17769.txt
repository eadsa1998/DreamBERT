I was with the Golden Girls.  It was supposed to be the first episode.  They were moving into a new house, but it was old.  There was rug on the walls, and spiders around.  I tried convincing them not to move into it.  Then I guess it was a commercial, and my family and I changed the channel.  There was a movie about a wedding.  My old friend Neil Block and my mother's friend's son and my first date Oliver, were at dinner.  I walked by and Oliver said he recognized me, I think.  I was picking up bottles for the wedding.  There was a tiger.  Somehow it turned into my boyfriend Jeremy's and my wedding as well; I couldn't think of a good excuse to say no, so we were also going to get married.  I rode on a horse carriage across a wooden bridge to the wedding site.  Then the channel changed back and we were watching Golden Girls in my grandmother's living room.  They were on a cruise ship.
