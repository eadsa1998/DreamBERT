First I dreamed that I was in a play directed by Esme, Hannah, and Margo, and I had a lead. I was rehearsing in front of the whole school for some reason. Then there was a magical world and a normal world, and I was part of both. But anytime something bad or scary happened in the magical world, my mother saved me somehow and brought me back to the normal world. There were all these weird curses on people, like they turned into dinosaurs. My brother always disappeared, and I was trying to get a job at the math help center. One time I was really scared, but no matter how hard I tried, my mother didn't come to save me. And then I realized that I had to save my mother. People kept asking me questions, so in real life I yelled, "I don't know!" and I said it in real life too. I just felt so trapped.
