I was with my fencing class and we were on a retreat with some of my friends. I kept on asking why Eli was being so mean to me. Everyone said he was stressed about colleges. We had to do posters of people's qualities and Linda showed us two ways to do them. I was going to do Eli and then apologize to him. I asked him how to spell his name even though I hoped he wouldn't know I was doing him. He answered "Greuff/m." We were by the ocean on a narrow trail. I wanted to tell him how I felt but he had left. Then we were back at the gym. My friend Gia was there and she was in a green skating dress. Linda tried to describe how Gia was skating a special part in our show. Then she asked who Evita was and then she explained who she was. Gia thought she was the Embassy Suites and I knew who she was, but I couldn't seem to say it. Then the gym turned into a skating rink and everyone started skating around. Gia raised her leg and did a spiral. Setting: A meeting room that turned into a skating rink, and a cliff, and a gym. Characters: Eli, a boy a used to like; Linda, my fencing teacher; Gia from my soccerteam. Feelings and Thoughts: Sad, worried. I felt disappointed that I couldn't tell him how I felt. I was beating around the bush.
