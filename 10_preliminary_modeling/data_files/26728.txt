 I'm walking on the Mud Mountain track with my friend Reed Maxwell. I pass my brother Wally and two men. We're walking out as they are walking in. It's 4:30pm. I tell them it's a two-hour walk to the hut. I advise them that they have to go over the hill, across the plains, and then down to the hut. I tell them to get out their flashlights at 5:00pm. Reed and I come to a camping area where a group of people are staying and camping. Reed wants to stay. I agree, although I'd rather just walk out. One of the men camping there tells us he has extra food and lays it out for us. A big wood fire is being built. I talk off my wet clothes and get my sleeping pad out. The man says something about stove fuel: either he does or does not have any extra. We're going to sleep in a tent with part of the group because they have a bit of extra space. I'm annoyed with Reed because he makes it seem, by what he says, that we're really ill equipped. This embarrasses me. We are not ill equipped. One of the men camping there has a daughter who speaks some German. She is eight-ten years old. I realize I left some of my clothes in my other suitcase and have only one sleeping bag. A man sings and plays guitar. He has a good, soft, gentle voice. He sings, "Come to me, baby, come to me." Another man and woman sing along. I see the seven sister stars in the sky. Two kids are there and sing along as well.
