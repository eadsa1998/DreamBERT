Ezra was watching TV. They were doing weird match ups. The match-up at the moment was The Doors and The Strawbs and Part of the Union was playing. They also did The Beatles and The Smiths. There was an interview with the cast of Arrested Development. Will Arnett had a whistle (the chipped tooth had happened in real life).
