I was trying to figure out what to buy Lilly H for a wedding gift. I saw her somewhere. I asked her if she was surprised that I wasn't at her reception and she said no. I felt like I needed to explain why I wasn't there but I was stumbling over my words trying to figure out what to say because I knew I didn't have a good reason. She thought it was because of what we have discussed in the past. that I simply don't leave my house enough when it means going somewhere alone. And that was a part of it. Then we talked about when we were going to get together again for brunch, and tried to find a date that would work for both of us and talked about where we want to go.
