I dreamed about my first boyfriend whom I had gone with in high school. The dream is rather vague, but he and I were walking along the street in A We were going to get his car which was parked near his father's gas station. He seemed to be much more attentive to me and very much pleased to have me with him. We met some other people but they are too vague for me to be able to identify them.
