I was going to a party with several couples I knew, probably from my hometown.  My date was a girl whose last name was Hay-but not Martha Hay because I asked her if she remembered Martha Hay, and she said yes.  I think she was about to go to sleep, or else she was just cuddling up next to me.  I think Susan Sanders was on the other side of me.  We were all in the back seat of someone's car.  No hanky-panky, though.
