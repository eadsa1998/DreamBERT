Dan Dailey and a woman are lovers. They sweetly and deeply love each other and so much enjoy being in each other's company. They are making love. Later, Dan comes up to the woman and smiles and says, "Hey, like the mama kitty and the mama bird, you are the mama...." I don't remember it exactly. But it refers to earlier scenes where a cute kitty cat was taking care of its young and the same for a mama bird. It meant she was a very loving mama kind of person and he honored that in her.
