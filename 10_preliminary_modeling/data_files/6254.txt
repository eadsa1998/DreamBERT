I dreamed that I was in a store with my girlfriend. I don't know what store it was but it was like a Bradlees or something like it. We were standing in line to buy something when my girlfriend looked at the woman in front of us and was trying to figure out who she was. She recognized her but didn't know how. She heard the sales clerk read her credit card back to her and she realized that that was not her credit card. She recognized the name as the woman's sister. I don't know who the women were or why I had them in my dream.
