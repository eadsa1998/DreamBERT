["Oceans Of Love"]  I am at the beach, near the edge of the ocean. A young man and I are attracted to each other. He is coaxing me to swim in the ocean. I am hesitant. I think the water will be cold. It is warm and he holds my hand as we step into the ocean. He leads me out toward the deeper water. I am afraid and excited. This is fun and yet I don't want to drown by being knocked over by big waves.  We are laughing and talking. He hugs me and pulls me closer to him. It is a very pleasant sensuous feeling. I think it is very intimate. Our full bodies are touching and I love the good feeling. We want to make love. We are in love. It is a very happy feeling. He then wades off to the right, near a deeper place with cold fast currents. I am afraid for him. He gets caught in the currents and is pulled under. I go near the dangerous area worried for him. He pops back up and escapes the currents. I am happy again.
