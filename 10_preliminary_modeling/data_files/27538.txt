I dreamt that I walked into a book store and there saw an ex-suitor, aged 28, who had proposed to me several months ago. I broke up with him about eight months ago because I wasn't interested in marrying him. He appeared very gracious and friendly when I entered. He was working there now, and seemed to be very well liked by the proprietor of the book shop, an older man of about 45, with a moustache. My friend led me to a book shelf and I leafed through several books. I had in mind the fact that my friend was now engaged to another girl and felt glad that he had found someone else. That is all I remember.
