Later: In a courtyard I've seen before. Old yellow adobe buildings with old neon signs -- you know, letters outlined. I need to take a crap, so I go. While I'm on this huge concrete toilet in a large stall, a 'gang' comes in and begins gruesomely killing the person in the stall next to me. A woman who looks familiar comes into my stall and tells me she's not into what they're doing; she's going to do every perverted thing to me she's always wanted to do to a man. Okay! So she proceeds to do so. Once she's finished, I turn around and see she's metamorphosed into Laura. I hand her a copy of "V." by Thomas Pynchon. <br/
