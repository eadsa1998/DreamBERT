 I am a student. I sit and play a video game when I should be studying for an exam. I want to program a formula into my calculator. The formula may be B=F(E), but I think there is a "P" in the equation somewhere. I need to pass a few levels on the video game to get the key, which is the formula. In the video game, there is a pink wax-like worm. It bounces and changes sizes. There are things the worm is trying to kill. I control the worm. There is a large bad creature in the game that jumps off the screen. I can see its shadow before it falls, like in the computer game Power Pete. It is some kind of dragon video game. There is a laser in the video game. I hold down a key on the controller and a green laser beam shoots out, killing everything in its way. I quit playing the game because I have too much to complete before I would obtain the key. <br/
