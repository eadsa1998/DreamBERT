I was in Jackson and I was supposed to catch a plane home. And Mom and I were in this bookstore. It was sort of like ______'s except it mainly sold like books and things. And we were digging through these racks and we were buying books and DVD's and stuff, and I found these books that told the story of "Little Mermaid" from the perspective of each of the characters, and the books were like shapes like the characters, and they flat at the binding end and shaped at the other end. And I was supposed to be at the airport at 12:00 and I was supposed to catch my plane at a quarter to 1:00, and so we're digging and we're shopping and dawdling around and ______ I got to the plane ______ got to the plane and then next thing I know, I look at the clock and it's like 5:00 and I totally missed the plane and they didn't get me to the airport on time. And I was so mad. And then I woke up.
