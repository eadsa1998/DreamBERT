I was out somewhere with Tristan. I couldn't find my sunglasses, but then found them in my pocket. We went to this big market thing and it was in another country. Fletcher was then there too and we passed a frozen yoghurt stand and I decided to get some. It said it was $8 for a medium, so I said I'd get a medium. The lady behind the counter was probably about 30 -35 and was fat. I asked which one was a medium and she pointed to the containers. There was a huge and random selection of flavours. I asked for a chocolate version of a flavour but she started getting the vanilla and I said I'd have one of each. I asked if I could get another flavour and she looked at me in astonishment and said it was only two. She also had put big scoops of the other two and the container was almost full. She asked if I wanted any toppings and she started reaching for the Oreos and I said 'ok I'll take the Oreos'. I asked if I could have the cookie dough as well and she just looked at me stunned and said no. She took it the counter the til said $44 and I was like what and then she said 'that comes to $75' and I was like 'wtf, it said it was $8 for a medium' and she said the weight values are on the side and I said yeah but it doesn't say anywhere we pay by weight, it said it's $8. I said I can't pay for this and she said if I didn't it was a $40 fine and I carefully said 'I didn't say I wouldn't, I said I couldn't. You can't expect me to pay $75 for frozen yoghurt?' The other people in the queue started standing up for me as well saying it was false advertising and it clearly said $8 and the lady started backing down and saying that she was starting to see our point of view.
