I saw the horses walking around. I saw the 2nd horse and I said, "I think he will win." His number was 51. I went by the ticket window and I gave him a stub, check, or ticket and asked him if it was good. He said, "Yes, if someone endorses it. Your daughter, son or friend." I gave it to Carter and he was endorsing it. Then we went to one of the turns and there was a gate. It was closed and straight, there were posts like on a dead end road. I met Vance and his girlfriend. He introduced me to her. When she took my hand, she gave it a hard squeeze. There was a small tree on a wall by Carter. I pulled it out and off.
