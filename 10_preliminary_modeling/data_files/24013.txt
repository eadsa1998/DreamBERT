It was a black setting with a boy, 10 years old, my little brother. He was telling me repeatedly to "turn it down." I could see and hear he was getting angry, because I didn't know what to turn down. I was confused and clueless. It seemed he knew exactly what he was telling me, and I had no idea. Finally he walked off, and I paid no attention to him. Suddenly I woke up and my alarm clock was blasting music. He was telling me to turn off the music. When I was awake I realized that, and felt very weird, like my dream was real, but it wasn't.
