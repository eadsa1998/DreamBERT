For some reason I, along with a large group of others, are forced to participate in a gymnastic event, but only as guardians. Two of us are chosen and it's our job to protect, or just make sure everything goes smoothly, for the two real gymnasts that are doing their routine on two poles. I keep getting chosen again and again because I never make a mistake. Then the "ring leader" calls me as well as this young boy, but he can't pronounce his name. He walks up next to me and I said, "Hey, what was your name?" and he gives me this look that says like, "Everyone always asks that." He goes by his ancient family named called "Arytheum." (I have no idea how it's pronounced, but those were the letters he told me.) He even pronounced it a few times, but I couldn't grasp it. The last time I was teleported out of the arena and into a car on a strange "other worldly" highway, and his name was being sung like through "plainsong." I knew that the car in front of me was him, and I accelerated to catch him, but he was driving really fast. Nevertheless, I got in and out of cars until I saw his brake light go on and I floored it. Right when I rear-ended him, I woke up.
