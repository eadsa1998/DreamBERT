Ezra, Clayton and I left home to find Mom. It was really dark. We got up the street but then decided that we should go back. It was then pitch black, literally -- there was no light whatsoever. We were confused. We edged our way back and started running whenever a car drove past (for the headlights). Eventually, we made it back home. I thought 'Now Mom will come and it will be all Close Encounters of the Third Kind'. It was. Mom was going to go meet Leslie. I was having trouble locking the front door. The wood door wouldn't close or lock. I then thought that it must be a dream and I managed to lock it. The power went out a few times and there was a door at the top of the stairs (it looked like Mom's house on the inside). I was then somewhere typing my password for my email and it was showing. I was hitting the right keys, but it was all wrong. I asked Mom to read out what I typed and I figured that it was a dream again.
