Myself and two other women were walking down a very dark street to go to work. I was thinking that the company should be responsible for having some kind of lights along the outside of the building. They would be held responsible if anything happened to an employee out here because of the lack of lighting. We could hardly see where we were walking or where the entry door was and I was feeling very uneasy. As soon as we got inside we realized something very bad was going on. There were men inside with guns. The employees that were in there when we arrived had tried to hide. Some of them didn't seem very well hidden and I was concerned that they would be found. This area was very well lit. One person was laying in a prone position on the floor, totally wrapped up in a tarp. But they wrapped the tarp fairly snugly around themselves so the men with gun could easily see it was a body in the tarp. There was roll of some type of fabric or material lying close to that person. Myself and one other person laid down on the floor and tried to cover ourselves with that fabric, only unrolling as much as we needed to so we would be covered. We laid close together and close to the roll in an effort to disguise our bodies. Now I am in a dark corner of another area. I am once again lying on the floor and trying to cover myself with some type of material that is somewhat rolled up, but mostly just piled on the floor. It was heavy and awkward and I found it very difficult to cover myself. Sheila G came up and laid down next to me and tried to pull some of this material away from me to cover herself. She was able to cover herself completely but it left me exposed. When I tried to recover myself she started struggling with me to keep herself covered. I found myself getting angry with her.
