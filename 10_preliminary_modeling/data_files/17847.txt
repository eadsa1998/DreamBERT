I was in class with my my best friend Emma.  She sat a row or two behind me.  We all had dittos of the first page of her paper- the title page.  It was a screen shot of a computer game with a neat relevant quote.  Some words had been scratched out, though.  I saw the copy machine in the corner and watched it pull through another sheet.  I wondered if it was another title page or the next page, thinking another title page would be a waste.  We discussed the paper in class and Emma started crying.  She was upset, claiming she didn't know, no one had ever told her the differences between the villages at Thanksgiving, and it wasn't fair that she was expected to know it.  I climbed over the seats behind me and ignored the boy sitting by her.  I hugged her and tried to soothe her.  I told her I didn't know the village differences either and she shouldn't be so hard on herself.  As I returned to my seat I realized they meant the first 13 states and we'd gone over that briefly in 8th grade, differences being the type of crops and exports.  I still thought it was ridiculous that Emma was supposed to remember that with no warning of having to know it.
