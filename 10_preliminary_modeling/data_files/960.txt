Two doors, one marked "Men" and one marked "Women." I go into the men's room because I am guiding a man through. I hope no one's in there to see me. I'd be embarrassed. The door opens into a narrow hall and goes to another door which opens into a school hall with offices off of it. Then I am going into one of the offices to talk to Leif, an older PE teacher. He's upset about one woman student. I reassure him. As I talk, I put one hand on his arm. His eyes warm up and he puts an arm near my shoulder and leans closer. I see this and try to make him realize that I'm just trying to reassure him, not fall in love with him. I then go out, across the yard to try the dormitory. I walk in. A woman, Virginia, one of my roommates, tells me the dryers are broken. There are lots of them in a row (clothes dryers). I look them over and push buttons. Virginia is already to go over to Leif and complain. I tell her not to. "He's happy now and besides, they're working O.K. now." She walks out with a blue dollhouse to show him. She's glad he's happy now. I suddenly feel glad to be alive. Things are working out O.K. I am in running shorts and decide I'll get back into jogging every morning at 6:00 a.m. I look out the window (venetian blinds, open) and feel happy.
