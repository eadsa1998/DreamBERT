Somehow I was in the inner circle of some US Government thing and I was having an affair with Obama. At first it was like his son and he was in his 30s, but then I think it was him. At one point I was meeting him in this hotel room and I had a key. I knew people were following me and all the locks were greyed out except for the last one and it worked. There was a just a bed, lounge and a TV. It was very basic (even the colour scheme was blah). There were people outside looking, but they left. Obama came and I said 'go' and he said to meet somewhere else and left. I was then somewhere else and he was on a stage with his wife and kids (he had 2 daughters and a son). I was talking to his wife and mother about stuff. Then I was on the stage too. Then I was someone else who he'd appointed vice president but then there was some lockdown thing happening because of a possible assassination and they chucked 'me' out and I was like 'you can't chuck out the vice president' but they were all like 'I'm the vice president now' and made me leave. They said I could take one item and Obama heard the ruckus and gave me this drawing he'd done of her/me one night. There was a flashback with this person who had purple and yellow paint down half of their face and all of their body. The left side of their neck and chest had thick black hairs, very spaced out and I was weirded out.
