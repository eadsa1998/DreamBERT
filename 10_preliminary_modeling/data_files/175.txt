I'm working in Circulation and just about to leave - this place is sort of a cross between a fair and a theater and a library, and there's a lot of people bustling out there. The desk is busy. One of my co-workers comes in the back office where I am, with (Alma?) and says we've got a money problem - something hasn't come out right about yesterday's fine money - we investigate and pretty soon find the problem. Yesterday was actually okay, but somebody's counted the first 5 for today without changing dates, making yesterday's look wrong. We're all relieved, and I can go home now.
