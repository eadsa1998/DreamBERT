I woke up sitting in my boyfriend Jeremy's truck, parked at the apartment.  I was somewhat disoriented though- from the view, he could not have been in our normal parking spot.  I looked around and got out.  It was morning, and raining. I looked out from the stairs up the side of the building.  There were leafy vines with huge (about a foot in diameter) pink roses hanging everywhere.  It was very beautiful.  I wanted to pick one to save as a memory of the apartment, not thinking that it wouldn't last.  I stood there looking out at them with the rain dripping off my face, blurring my vision somewhat.  I felt the refreshing, comforting chill of the rain.
