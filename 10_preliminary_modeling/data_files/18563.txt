I went ??? the. I needed to get some money so I went to the Oaks Cinema. They were all out. Then I went to the ???, which was closed on Monday. Elena turned into Evelyn and we lived in the tree house above the ground floor movie (theater). She had $9.00. A guy captured me when he was walking around and around and around the town square. When he marched me around the town square holding a gun in my back, I was so scared I couldn't talk. I opened my mouth to say something, to yell,, and nothing would come out. He had a razor blade with the single edge blade and Dora grabbed it from him to try and save me and I screamed, "Dora, DON'T!" But she had already grabbed it with her hand, her palm was already way ??? She closed her hand to save mine and it got cut deep and bloody, bad from the razor blade.
