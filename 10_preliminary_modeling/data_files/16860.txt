I'm at a gig. A band are setting up and preparing to play. The venue is fairly small, like a village hall, or possibly a marquee. The band are a bunch of people I know. The singer is based on a guy I knew who used to sing in a local band. I play guitar with them during the sound check. I enjoy the experience but soon I have to stop because the sound check is over and the performance is about to start. I sit amounts the audience on a slightly inclined grassy bank, wishing I could have been there on stage.
