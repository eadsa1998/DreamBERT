I was driving into a store parking lot and parked my car into a handicapped space right next to a black truck. There were two people inside the truck. One of the people was a male and the other one was female. The girl seemed to be in her early adolescence. After I parked I got out of the car, and then turned around. I see the two people who were in the truck get out of the truck and open the passenger side door to my car and get into my car. The guy was behind the driver's seat and the girl was in the passenger seat, just as they were in the truck. Then I opened the driver's side front door and yanked the guy out of my seat. I was extremely angry that someone would invade my space. I then locked my door and the girl locked her door so the guy couldn't get back in, and I knew then that I could trust her. Then when we drove out of the parking lot, I could see the guy she was with chasing us and with him was another male chasing us. The newest male was the girl's boyfriend. So these two guys chased us throughout my dream. I felt they were going to rape us, but I wasn't scared because they didn't seem like much of a threat. Then the girl and I came to a bridge. I was looking at the lake below the bridge and I was thinking that I would rather jump off the bridge and risk the fall rather than being caught by these two guys. The fall made me think of the one Harrison Ford took from a storm drain in the movie, "The Fugitive." All of a sudden it started to rain and the bridge was filling with water and I was wading through it. I felt like I was going in slow motion and was worried that these guys could catch up to me more quickly. There were a lot of people surrounding me, sailing boats and relaxing. Then the first guy I encountered came up to me and grabbed me so I wouldn't jump off the bridge. He said not to worry, that he wouldn't hurt me. Someone had hired him to chase me so that I would have some adventure in my life.
