I was at a sort of craft fair.  My longtime classmate Becky was there and had some neat items for sale I was looking at.  A pig statuette on a wooden pole in a plant pot.  I was very impressed with the guinea pig figures she made.  I also looked at a corner table.  After looking at most of the items again I was only really considering the pig pole.  I went and got my boyfriend Jeremy to look at them as well, but he was leaving it up to me.  My friend from high school Bryan was there somewhere.  I went home (to my parents') to consider it.  I'd already purchased something from Moby.  Then I started thinking about it- I got worried at first, because I hadn't yet paid for my Moby purchase- and then I remembered I hadn't been sent the bill yet either, so I was okay.  I went in to get something to eat.  I sat at a small round table eating a sandwich when my music teacher came in.  I talked to him a bit about the high price of lunch.  The hot meal was actually supposed to be cheaper because of the discount, but I didn't qualify, and couldn't afford either lunch, really.  I was shocked when he told me he'd work it out for me so I could get the hot lunch.  I objected as it was such a generous offering, but he insisted, and I was very happy.  I went to get ready for school.  I got my old purple backpack and started loading it up.  I realized it was 5 to 8, I would never get to school on time.  I thought it was strange that my teacher, who was now in the kitchen, wasn't in a big hurry as he was due at school at the same time I was.
