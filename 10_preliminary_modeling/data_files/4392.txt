["Reading about movie stars."] Now Jack Lemmon is standing on the edge of the lawn, looking at me as I lie on the grass examining an odd magazine I bought. It is like a comforter quilt with slits in it. I reach my hand into the slit and pull out a magazine to read. Some of them are about movie stars. I see an article about Whoopie Goldberg. I also read an article about Katherine Hepburn making another film and how they are betting she lives long enough to finish it as she is over 90 years old. There is a buffet laid out on a table and I go over and examine the foods. I notice I can eat some of them on my diet, but I see pasta salads and things I can't eat. I choose not to eat anything.
