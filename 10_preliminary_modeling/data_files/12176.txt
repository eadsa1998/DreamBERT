I was at a video shop and Kevin Spacey was there, and he was high and sitting on a shelf. I was going to ask if I was allowed to get his autograph but then this guy asked him so I did too. He wrote on a bit of paper "nerd, nerd, nerd" and wrote something about a moose. He tore the sides off. He was asked to get a new cover for The Evil Dead by 9am and I told him about some computer place where he could do it. We had to work there. We came back later and hid in the cupboards. I was driving Kevin's car to get to this friend of mine and I got lost.
