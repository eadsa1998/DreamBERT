I can remember only a few details of the dream: I was in a formal, but I can't remember why. There was a grass fire, it seemed to be a lawn with short mowed green grass, yet the fire raced across it, and threatened to burn a large woods which was next to this lawn or whatever it was. But the fire was put out just as it reached the edge of the woods.
