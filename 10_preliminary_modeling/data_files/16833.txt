My friend Sal was involved in a strange ritual - something like a cross between a dance class and a game of musical statues (but in a large circle of people all moving round in one direction and stopping occasionally). I walked from First Road to see him. It was halloween I think, and in the dream there was a tradition where we were to scare strangers in the street in the dark - even by hitting them on the back lightly to make them jump. I did this but I felt unsure and uncomfortable about it. Sal was upset during the ritual for some reason. I put my arm around him and noticed he was incredibly fat with thick folds of flesh around his waist.
