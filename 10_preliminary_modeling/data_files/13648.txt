There was some Bonnie and Clyde thing. It wasn't actually them, but they were on the run. They stole a car and some people told the cops the plates on the car so they dumped it and looked for another. They took a van and ended up on a long road and they ended up at this place which was a school. This teacher lady was giving them trouble but eventually realized that they were ok and she let them take her car. The school was spooky and really rundown.
