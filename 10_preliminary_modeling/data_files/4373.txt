["Bathing with Ginny."] There are a series of warm comfortable baths. A small bathroom in supposedly Ginny's house. The tub is an old fashioned one up on legs. A small sink to it's right and a toilet near the door. The configuration is just like in the Mac house bathroom. Between baths, I am on the toilet and pee. Later as I get back into the bathtub, I notice I forgot to flush. I feel a bit embarrassed about that, but not too much. Ginny comes in naked from her bath and asks if its all right if she plays a favorite recording of hers. I say great. She puts an LP album in the sink, which still has some water in it. That is the record player. I sit in the tub which is finishing draining from Ginny's daughters bath. The water is a dark bile green. Then I put a plug in the tub to fill up fresh water for my next bath. Ginny's son comes in for his bath. Apparently there are two bathtubs. Ginny asks me if I am embarrassed by being naked and other people being there. I say no problem. It is all very friendly and comfortable.
