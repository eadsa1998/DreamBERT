I am in some resort hotel room. I decide to take a shower. It is a very wide open shower area, in the large open room. There isn't any furniture in there. A flimsy shower curtain is across the door to the room. A woman, perhaps my sister in law, Corinne, is trying to lock the curtain after she left. She is going to get something. I pick up a notebook which has the events that will happen later that night all written out. I see that I shall see about 5 movies in a row until 2am in the morning. It all feels laid back and relaxed. Another woman and her friend is industriously trying to work with a shape in a closet like area in the hall. I peek in and see a green painted square on the side wall. I come back into the room, still interested in having a shower at some point.
