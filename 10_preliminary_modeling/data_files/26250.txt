 I'm at home in Oak Valley in the kitchen with some friends, including Tim Zelling, Jeff Bautsch, Nat Miller, and others. Some of the guys have been drinking. Someone needs to go and get Jeff's car. I 'm the one to do this because I'm sober. I ask my mom if I can use her car for a half hour. I go into her bedroom, where she is, to ask her this. She says I can use the car. I need anther person to drive with me so they can drive the other car back. Tim can go. I ask him if he would do this, otherwise it will have to be Nat or Jeff, if they're not drunk. Jeff's car is over by the Hancock Center.
