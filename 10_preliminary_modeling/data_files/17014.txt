There's a kind of party at my childhood home but it's more like an organised game of 'catch'. There's about 100 people in the garden, which has been lit up by lamps - it is after dark. The game involves throwing a large weighted rubber ball or balloon which others have to catch. It must not hit the ground. There may be two teams. We take it in turns to be high up (on the terrace) or low down (on the lawn). The other participants are young men and women - they are unfamiliar to me. The atmosphere is very sexually charged.
