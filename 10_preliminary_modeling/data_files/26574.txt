 There is a sandy island with rock cliffs. There is a secret entrance to the island through the rocks. Three pirate ships are there: they are a distraction. There are some refugee-like people escaping with the aid of an undercover man. I'm with my friend Stephen Ramos and the main character from the television show McGyver. Later, I am the main character of McGyver. There are guns and shooting takes place. I kill five or six people, but not my grade school's secretary, Angie Sacks. Some girls there fake an injury.
