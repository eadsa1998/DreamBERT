I was in some sort of place like the Kennedy Center.  As I was going up some stairs through a very narrow portal, I met Marilyn Maher, who was coming down.  I came face to face with her, in hopes of making a kiss the obvious and convenient thing to do.  She turned aside somewhat embarrassedly, though, and later on she said, in a group setting, that I had her "buffaloed."  By the way she said it, I interpreted it to mean she was romantically inclined toward me in spite of herself-but I was afraid I was only thinking wishfully.
