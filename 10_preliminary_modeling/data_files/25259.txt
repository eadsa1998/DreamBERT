 I'm on the bridge that goes over the Main River near downtown Wilmerton with my friend Binky Ahmed. We are on the sidewalk. There are two policemen on the bridge. Binky tells them that our friend Lyle Zeffman got put in jail for a month for drinking. I am surprised. Then our friend Lyle is on the bridge near the policemen. He is drunk. He falls off the bridge, and drowns. The policemen don't do anything about this. Binky and I leave. We are riding on phone booth-like machines. The booths are tipped on their sides and have blades or wheels on the bottom. As soon as we are away from the police, I start to run. Binky falls behind. I run through yards and jump over fences. On some fences I jump, I feel I'm in slow motion, suspended in the air. I try to find the Burns County Fair, but I am disoriented. I am with my friend Elise Rooks. We are sitting on the ground on the east side of Wilmerton. We flirt. I really want to make out with her. I act silly, like I am a little drunk, in hopes that her flirtatiousness will get carried away. We are then at Elise's house. There is a phone call for me. At first I think it might be my ex-girlfriend Annie, but I can't tell from the voice. Then I realize it is my friend Nicole Peterson, who is at a camp in Connecticut. I'm surprised she calls me. She sounds like she needs a friend. My brother Wally is there and he listens on another phone. We put Nicole on speakerphone for a bit.
