Our house was different and was attached to others. Sammy was renting the one next to us. One night he was going to a party and he came into my room to ask for something. He took some black thing when he left. I told Mom later. Darren had let Rover out and I was out there with him and he chased the cats over the fence. Sammy was going to the party with Vanessa (Gossip Girl). I was playing World of Warcraft. I was with a girl and we went into a level 17 instance and I died before I even entered it, which confused me. I was watching Gossip Girl. Chuck was friends with some guy. They kissed once and then started dating. Chuck was bothered by his homosexuality at first, but now he was fine with it. He and the guy were naked in bed (but were covered). His boyfriend said "I love you" and he kissed him. Later, Chuck was talking to Nate and said "I love him". I was talking to Ezra about it later but he hadn't seen it. I went to the university orientation. This guy was a TV show producer. I was talking to Ezra, saying I preferred movies and he said he preferred TV shows because of the way "characters bloom". Then, he, his friend (who was Nate) and I all said "Chuck" at the same time. Ezra thought it was funny. I had a letter from the university, confirming my acceptance and it had been sent on the 10 January.
