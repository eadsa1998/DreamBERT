At table with tall green pictured glasses of ginger ale. There are three of us, tow men and I. Wonder why I have no drink. Taking my order. "Potatoes or rice, jello or chocolate pudding, coffee or tea?" I order rice, chocolate pudding and say, "nothing to drink. This cold drink is enough." He asks if I have enough to get back to Hawaii. If not, ask him. I say, "I wouldn't start without plenty of margin but I didn't know I'd have to be hospitalized." Then I remember with consternation that I haven't paid that bill. How odd I left without doing so. I remembered we left by side entrance in late evening. In hospital a man in a wheelchair is pointed outs as an excellent patient. He is paying his expenses by working on surgical dressings. I'm walking around and see other patients.
