The dream that I can remember had something to do with the Nazis. We were in this big hall listening to this speech by Hitler when we decided that we weren't going to stand for this or be part of it. So we got a whole bunch of suitcases from somewhere and some provisions which included a quart of buttermilk and stuck them in the back of a car and went off. Knowing that these people had seen us go, I asked my husband how he thought we were going to get away and I suggested the route out of the town that was less obvious than the one we were going to follow. He said it didn't make any difference because they had police all over the place anyhow. So I didn't understand how he thought we were going to get away. Anyhow we started off. There was a road across the bridge we were supposed to go across, but they were working on it, so they made a detour road consisting of two very winding lanes not on the same level with each other to go across the river at two different places. We were following the lower of these two roads. Then there's a movie. I have quite a few dreams which have sort of movie techniques. The scene was back at this great hall where this speech had been held. Hitler, or whoever it was, was saying to one of his companions, "Have they been captured yet?" Somebody said yes, we got them at such and such a place. Then my husband and I appeared on the scene. We were led in by somebody or other. It's really about as far as I remember.
