I received a letter from J-- inviting me to a dance at C-- College. I was very pleased, and bought a whole new wardrobe for the trip. The next part of the dream was at the railway station at Indianapolis. J-- and his fraternity brothers met me. They thought I was the most beautiful girl they had seen. The next part of the dream was at the dance. I had on the most beautiful dress of any, and the fraternity brothers of J--'s fraternity kept begging me to dance with them. The girls were all jealous of my popularity.
