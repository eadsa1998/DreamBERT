I am with other patients with a JEWISH PSYCHIATRIST and we help him decorate his office; very informal we joke around a lot; He also dances and sings with us; At one point I drop my photos and I.D. cards and the secretary from the Counseling Center helps me pick them up. Then I have my hour with the psychiatrist and he doesn't seem to take me seriously....
