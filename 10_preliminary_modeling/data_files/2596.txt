Warm Love, Shame And Healing. I am in love with Robin Williams and he with me. The only trouble is he is married. I am in a room I share with a female roommate. I am eating chocolate figures, all but the hats. My roommate asks didn't I know the hats were chocolate too? I said I didn't and pick up the little chocolate brim. I will go back and eat the other hats later. Robin comes in the door. I am glad to see him because I love him and desire him, and I am sad to see him because I must resist him because he is married. He tries to embrace me and kiss me. He is sweet and I want him, but I push him away. He is unhappy and realizes he must give up his wife so we can be together. Now I am happy and we hug and kiss deliciously. Now I am a fat business man who brings things to this bad gangster boss. I (the observer) feel sorry for him, but he looks at me (like I'm the TV camera ) and says, "I asked for it. I choose to do it." He feels resigned and guilty. He knows he is not a victim and chooses this degrading life style. The boss snaps his fingers and the man goes to get what the boss wants. Now I am a counselor on a couch talking with a young woman, my client. She is telling me how she can now be assertive and free with her own feelings and needs. She says I changed her whole life. I say, "No, I didn't, you did." She asks was the ability to change always then or did the counseling put it there? I say the natural ability was always there but the counselor gave skills and techniques that helped the natural ability to be used. We are all pleased with ourselves and each other. Robin is there too.
