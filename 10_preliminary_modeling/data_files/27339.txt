I dreamed I had helped my mother rearrange the living room. She had company in and when we all went into the living room I saw that she had put the furniture back in its original position. I was absolutely furious &amp; hurt to think that I had spent my whole day rearranging the room only to find that Mother had switched the furniture around when my back was turned. I told her just what I thought of this in front of the company. I was very frank and brazen about it.
