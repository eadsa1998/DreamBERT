A car carrying two people inside pulls into the driveway of my house. The driver is a short, young woman who gets out of the car and walks to my front door where I am standing. She looks confused and opens a small piece of paper with the words "Republic Airport" written down, indicating that she is lost and seeks help. "It is not far from here", I say. Then she explains that her passenger is "X.'s wife", i.e., the wife of my girlfriend's boss. She asks if I can drive the two of them to the airport. I hesitate. Then the passenger gets out of the car and comes to the door. She is a tall, attractive middle-aged woman. "Pleased to meet you, Doctor Y.", she says to me gracefully. Impressed that she knows my title, I think to myself, "She really knows who I am." Then I say to the two women, "Okay, let's go."
