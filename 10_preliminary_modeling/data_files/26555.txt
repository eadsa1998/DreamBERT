 There is an alligator carrying a chunk of a log in its mouth. The log is then a frog in a gulp of water. The alligator filters out the water and eats the frog. I hold a huge fish, either a muskellunge or a northern pike that is about 20 pounds, partially in the water. It has a covering on its teeth that may be green. It has human teeth, and very powerful jaws. I have my hand inserted fully into its mouth. I slowly remove my hand. I anxious about being bitten! I let the fish go in the water, where I see trout and bass frantically swimming away from this huge fish. <br/
