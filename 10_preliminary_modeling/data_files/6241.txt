I had a dream that I was wearing blue Gap jeans, a green silk shirt, my leather coat, shoes, my Oakley blades and I was at a car dealership trading in my red Firebird for a new white Mustang GT. The Mustang was all souped up. It had tinted windows, eagle GT tires, 5 speed, nose bra, black outs on the lights, a sunroof, Alpine stereo system and all I had to pay was one thousand dollars. I had just test driven it and then I was signing my name on the ownershp papers and then I woke up.
