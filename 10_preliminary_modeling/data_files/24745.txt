I was at school. My parents had a jar with a rat. A lion started chasing my parents. I ran inside. Kids were happy and playing. I seemed to be stuck between two worlds: I saw my parents run to the car away from the lion and drive away. I was left alone in another world. Setting: At my old school. Characters: Mom - scared. Dad - scared. Me - scared. Kids - happy. Teachers - happy. Lion - hungry. Rat - asleep. Feelings and Thoughts: Sad, scared, worried. I was afraid of the lion, sad to be abandoned and worried for my parents.
