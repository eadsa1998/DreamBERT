I am at Ginny's. Mateo and I are going to sleep together on a mattress in front of the TV. It's a treat. I then remember I can't get down to the floor, with my knees. I suggest we sleep on the bed in the other room. I remind myself that it's OK because Mateo is a small boy. Then, we are in the parking lot of Safeway or Fred Meyers. I am asking the store desk for some oily stuff to go in my pickup. She doesn't have any, but she says, "I have something that might work." She goes to an open freezer thing and digs around. I say, "Candy?" She says, "No. We also keep medicines here," and gets a container (a tube) and squirts what looks like whipped cream into a paper cone. It's messy and hard to hold. I grimace and say, "Thanks a lot," sarcastically. I say to Dwight, "I guess we'll try to put in on the engine before we leave." He says he knows how and goes out. The clerk asks if I want any cat litter. She shows me a selection of different sizes of pebbles and gravel. I think about it, but feel tired and decide to wait until I get to Ginny's, even though I know it will be more work for them. I go outside and see the pickup gone and two dogs and a small toddler girl running across the street. I am appalled. The young boy had gone off on a joy ride. Ginny wasn't thinking well enough to give permission. I urgently call the girl and the dogs out of the street. I take her hand and we walk on the top of a path that's like a thick fence top. She falls off to the right side and I nearly fall off the left side. We wobble back to the parking lot. The pickup is back. I lecture Ginny (scold, a little). I see Dwight instructing the boy to put the whipping cream stuff on a roll of insulation. I say, "That won't help. It's supposed to go in the engine." What a mess. Nothing is going right.
