I bought a house for $15,000 for Dad for his birthday. This house had like a pool and a deck and little waterfall things and decks leading into a main house that was just like ours. And we were in the bedroom with some people, I guess they were the former owners. We were talking and eating. They were showing me this thing, the size of five decks of cards that was supposed to be a CD player, and it was like covered with cloth. And we were supposed to be able to play CD's on it and we would hear it without having to connect it to anything. So we were getting ready to play it, and I guess that this unit here was also supposed to be a CD player, and it was a little _smaller, and then we talked about, we were getting ready to make, we were getting ready to have Dad's birthday party in there. But he really liked the house; I was surprised. I didn't think he was going to like the house.
