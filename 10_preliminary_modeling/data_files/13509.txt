I was at school. These people asked me if "Jonathan" had asked me to this dance. I was like "Who the hell is Jonathan?". They said he liked me and pointed him out. He was small and ugly. I was talking to him later. Later still, I was at the car park and I saw Eugene. I went into the school again and I got lost. There were elevators.
