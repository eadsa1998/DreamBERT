A college friend (age 20--female) and I were standing in an open field. Another friend of ours (age 20--female) was on a donkey. The donkey was out of hand and kept running down the field to hurdle a row of bushes. Our friend was afraid and only partially seated on the donkey. The donkey continued going up and down the field. My friend and I stood and laughed and laughed. It seemed so funny.
