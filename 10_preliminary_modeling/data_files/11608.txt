I dreamt that I was walking down a strange street and passed a schoolyard. There one of my youngest brother's friends (age 10) saw me and followed me. I tried to chase him away, but he persisted in following me. I went to a house and met a strange attractive girl. I kissed her in the doorway, but she scolded me for kissing her in public. The little boyfriend of my brother was watching us. I finally chased him away, but felt ashamed for being a bit harsh with him. Then the girl and I went upstairs to her living room where we did some talking and some more kissing. Then I awoke.
