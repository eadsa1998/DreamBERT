Our neighbor from across the street was bringing boxes of junk to store in our attic. It seemed strange since we both own our own house, but she told us that she and her husband had become our landlords. Later I was upstairs sitting on the attic floor in my plaid formal, looking at the boxes. She had a whole box of stockings and a large box full of evening purses. I thought that she was a hoarder because of the stockings.
