I was in English class, the day before vacation. Much to my surprise everyone handed in term papers. We had been given the date they were due several weeks ago. I had not realized that today was the date set. I was very exasperated with myself because I had the paper all written but it was only on scrap paper. The papers all seemed to have a lot of drawing and pictures on them and they all looked alike (something like a lab notebook). The only thing I could think to do was to hurry home and copy mine so I could hand it in the same day. I was very worried because I did not want to get a low mark because my paper was late.
