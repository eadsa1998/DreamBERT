I am in a room. Two women and myself are listening to a man named Bob how is lecturing on some subject. One of the women has already spoken on this subject and he discounts her thoughts and feelings. He is boring and not very accurate. After the speech, he realizes he has not done well and that the woman was correct. He looks for her to apologize. He respects her now. The women say it's time to go home. We walk out the building and down the street. A bus passes us with cute animals like penguins seating in them. Another bus goes by with a paper mache stork in the back. I am tired now and so the woman uses her remote control to call the car to us. It rushes past us, the bumper dangling down. It is broken. It smashes over a cliff and falls to the desert floor. We go to the edge and look over, I feel fear and vertigo. The woman was pulled into the crash and killed. She rises as a fairy angel spirit. Bob is now a red devil suited spirit and she makes him chase her in an opposite direction from us to save us. We are now tiny, like fairies and  walk through a hedge with beautiful purple flowers. We see on the other side a meadow with a fairy castle at the far end. I see white dog dragons flying toward us, sent by the fairy woman to help us. I am amazed to see that we are really in a meadow right next to the outskirts of our home town. The buildings are huge and loom high above us.
