I dreamed that the end of the world was on its way. It felt like it would be of the infected zombie variety. I had a power, and so did others -- like heroes. Nobody was sure what was going to happen or what was happening, but they all had a sinking feeling -- as if it was bad, hopeless.  Many had given up hope. I still felt like I could do something. I was running through the building where my people were. It had glass sliding doors. I eventually ran to this truck yard type place, where there had also been a university science lab. Many elements and chemicals of the lab were still there. Though the mercenaries, with their giant trucks parked and idling, ready to go at a moment's notice, had taken over, I didn't fear them. I commandeered one of their big assault trucks and was confident in my power. Since I had this special power, they were by default at my service, as if the government recognized me, and hired them, and I was their commander. I went around the leftovers of the science lab with the hope of finding a solution. It was all old and done, though, with orange powders and such desiccating in what looked like fish tanks.
