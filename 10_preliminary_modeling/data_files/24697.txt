I was in school and at a play. There were three new boys. The oldest one gave me presents. They kept coming out of this box. There was a witch. She locked the old one in a cage. Suddenly there was a gust of wind. I struggled for the key and unlocked it. Then I went to some movie with the 5th grade. I went down to sit. Some people sat five rows behind us. Setting: At school. Characters: Three boys, my class, and a witch. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, scared. I was happy most of the time, but scared when I had to get the key to unlock the cage.
