I was in my elective and we went outside to play soccer. I had to be the goalie. The assistant P.E. teacher made the P.E. teacher do 30 situps because she talked. Then my friends and I were following a car. I don't remember why. Setting: I don't know. Characters: There were people in my dream and I do know most of them (P.E. teacher and assistant P.E. teacher). Feelings and Thoughts: Happy. I felt happy.
