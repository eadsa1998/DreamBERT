I am very attracted to Dr. Fleischman. He is attracted to me. There people around us so we shyly hang out together. He begins to kiss me and we start necking. Only our faces are turned toward each other. The bodies are not turned to lie up against each other. I miss that connection and so does he. He says, "Let's lie down," and we lie down together on a table. We kiss and feel sexual desire, and start to make love. Some angry girl is watching. I'm going to get in trouble. I leave and the next day I am telling a group of people that I spent the day doing something else, in an attempt to protect Dr. Fleischman. Only he doesn't understand I'm trying to protect him and he gets hurt and angry at me for pulling away from him.
