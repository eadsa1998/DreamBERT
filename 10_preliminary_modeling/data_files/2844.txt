Howard wants to make love and I want to make love, but not to him because I don't want to have to be obligated to do it with him all the time. I choose to walk away, feeling sad for us both. Then Merle comes by and kisses me. I want to pull away from him. Then I am trying to get my name typed on a business card and am at a store trying out a typewriter that does that. The salesman is sweet and good-looking, like Tom, sort of, only nicer and better. Merle is on my right. On my left, I have a box full of credit cards that I collected over the years. They are still in their envelopes. I notice that I have some of Merle's that had been sent to my address and I never forwarded them on. The typewriter crumbles a card and I have some trouble but finally make it work and admire the look of the type. I decide to keep the old, outdated cards so I can refer to their various layout designs. I am ready to leave and stand. The man leans on a wall and we flirt. Then he pulls me to him and we kiss. It is sweet and I love it. He asks me to dinner and I agree, thinking he means I will cook dinner. I go home and fix spaghetti. He comes to the door and says, "Let's go out, my treat." I pull him in, laughing, "Another time, this time I've cooked for you." He says he'll be on TV later; the feeling is he has something he needs to tell me but can't because he's afraid I'll leave. I say, "The food is on the stove, where my mother left it." We sit at the big table. I have some trouble getting between the stove and the table, but manage. We eat, then sit on the couch. I lay down with my head in his lap so happy to be with him. The TV comes on and I wake up, but I finish the dream in my mind. He was in prison, perhaps taking a rap for a friend and has been released on good behavior. He desperately wants to be loved and I want to love him.
