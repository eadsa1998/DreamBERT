It was a very clear day -- the day my sister who is 18 and I were to be married. We were coming down the two side aisles in the H.T. I went first with my father leading me and then my sister followed with my mother. We each had four bridesmaids and six ushers. This is a blurred image. We came simultaneously to the altar where all the attendants were displayed on both sides of the altar. The rabbi gave one speech for both of us and then the dream was gone.
