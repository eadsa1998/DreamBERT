We were in the car and we parked in this 'extra' carpark at Science Museum. Nana was with us. Margarita told someone that I was fat and I said "At least I'm not fat and ugly like you". The Science Museum was across the road. Then I was there with Mom, Ezra and Darren. We had these cards which allowed us to buy stuff. It wasn't the Science Museum though; it was just this gigantic shop. They had some cool clothes and I found some gloves. Then I had no pants on. Mom signed under my name for the card. I wanted to do it though. There was this cool skeleton outfit. I was trying to decide what to buy. I was calling out across the shop. I found these school bags and one had lots of pockets. There were also these REALLY big bags. I was looking for a wallet. I found these people who did something and they were evil or something. I was in some section and this said that I wasn't allowed there. They were calling for me over the speaker, so I got out. Tim Brunero was there and he said that I was "allowed anything" from outside the shop. They were packing it away and then he turned into Mandy Patinkin. There was a cool jumper and a cool raincoat thing. Mandy put on the jumper and I was like "Yeah, I want that one!". It was blue and completely different from the one I wanted but I thought it was red. So I found a blue one in my size. My name had already been put down for it and I was like 'How did that happen?'. Then I was back in the shop. There were Easter eggs. Dad carried me through this tunnel. I told him to ask the manager at McDonald's for my Easter egg. The manager looked like Joseph Cotten.
