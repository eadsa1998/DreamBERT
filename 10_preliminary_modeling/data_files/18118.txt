My husband and I seem to be driving down some little mountain roads. There was an episode concerning the an Inn in a mountain resort town, which is a sort of fancy hotel that I saw not very long ago on our vacation, and also concerning a huge pink hotel which is close to it. Some girl was telling me that this other hotel was really a lot better and that was why they didn't need to advertise so well as the Inn. The girl--who is about my age--and I went walking down toward this pink hotel, down a long series of not exactly stairs. It was a hill that had little bricks set in, but it really wasn't stairs. I can't describe what it was. Somehow this  Inn becomes a very small place, a sort of motel or small hotel further up in the mountains and my husband and I are there. There are quite a few dirt roads around it and also one paved road. It is supposed to be sort of a private scenic tour for the patrons of this place. We see quite a few other people who have come back from it, who are going on it, and so we decided we will too. We start down and once we seem to have made a mistake because it's extremely narrow. And it looks so small, you wonder how a car could get down it. And it's very sharply curved and a lot of the curves occur going down at about a 45-degree angle and then just sort of disappear at a right angle around the cliff. And also the road seems to have been cut out right under them. The cliffs, rather the rocks of the cliff, are hanging right over the road and yet we started on this road and there's no way to turn around. So we keep on going on it for a while and it's rather confused what happens after this. Somewhere we found a wild turkey, a live one, which was a very strange-looking bird, and we ran into my family, at least my little brother (10-year-old brother) and we showed him the wild turkey and he was sort of impressed by it.
