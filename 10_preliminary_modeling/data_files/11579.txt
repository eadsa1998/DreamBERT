I was driving along Superior Avenue when I saw the owner of the filling station where I do business being beaten up by three or four thugs. I swung into a side street about E.108, took a hammer out of my tool kit and went back to the fight. I hit one of the thugs with the hammer, striking the back of his head with all my might. He turned and told me to beat it. Mike, the victim, then told me to go on, they were some of his friends from Brooklyn.
