I dreamed that Chuck Branden, my boyfriend (22) and I were in the Lasalle Theatre. There were about four other young boys in the show with us, all unknown to me, and all about the age of 10 to 12. As a matter of fact, they all resembled each other in looks Instead of watching the movie, they were all reading comic books and were in a more or less reclining position. I was laying down on a couch and Chuck was sitting beside, me, but I don't recall what we were talking about. Then the scene shifted and I was in a school room. The room resembled the school where I attended the second and third grades - Roosevelt Elementary School in Euclid, Ohio. There were about 15-20 students, none of whom I remember. My husband, Chuck, was the professor. I was sitting in the front row to his right conversing and acting silly with the girl who sat next to me. I knew my husband was getting angry with me and would bawl me out when we got home, so when the bell rang, I rushed out of the door and didn't wait for him.
