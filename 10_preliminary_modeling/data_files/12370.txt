I was at Nana's and she had this big fishing thing. There were mats etc. We went fishing and Nana was putting the bait on. She fell in and then I did. Later I was getting dragged along and the mats hurt my teeth. There was a lighthouse and there was a girl there with an axe. She was called Ariana or something. There was a teacher guy called Alistair. He showed me something and then news. There was stuff about Monty Python. Ezra was on the phone to Mom about a bike.
