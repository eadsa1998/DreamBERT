I am in bed with Aunt Rosalie and her face looks like mine. Uncle Gus comes over and sits on the bed and I watch Aunt Rosalie's face as she is obviously in love with him and she looks at him so lovingly and wistfully. I confront Uncle Gus, who looks young, and good-looking. I say, "Did you molest me?" He looks surprised I would ask that and avoids answering. I say, "Then did you do it to other cousins?" He hems and haws. I then say, "Well, you did it with Darcy." He accidentally agrees. I've caught him. Then does that mean he did it with me too? He worms around and puts his arms around Aunt Rosalie who seems to only be focused on wanting him.
