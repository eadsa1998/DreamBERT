I went to a Army/Navy surplus store. I was buying a pair of gloves. They were suppose to have been my father's but the man at the desk wrote the sizes with a blue ball point pen on the inside wrist of the gloves. my father's hands were bigger than mine, so these were not the actual gloves he wore. The man still had my father's information in the notebook. I couldn't remember if my father had been in the army, navy or marines. I told the man I'd like to get a whole army outfit, just like my father's, in my size and he said it'd cost me about $40,000. I went to a pep rally and a girl was doing an offensive cheer. I thought it would hurt people's feelings. She was spelling out something that started with a "B." Then I heard a beautiful sonata from a composer whose name started with "H." Zeb had walked to Coney Island and the man with him was fat and strange. Awake. 3 days after, he was amazed by Zeb.
