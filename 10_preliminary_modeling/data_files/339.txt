I'm in a school, we're doing a LT, it's the afternoon break. Most of the trainees are here, but most of the team is gone, and the trainers aren't here but a couple of guys in suits who belong to the school are. This is a regular classroom, with windows, and somebody's seen smoke. I look around and find a very odd thing outside a window: there's a desk, with a chair, everything as if it were in an office, right outside one window, behind a hedge, and on it is a can or something with smoke coming out, just pouring out in a funnel (as if it started from a little spot and was flowing fast). It may not be an actual fire yet, but it's unattended and looks dangerous to me. I go and tell the guys about it (the ones in the suits), concerned whether we should put out an alarm. They don't think it's such a big deal, and I say to the group, well then I'll go see what I should do about it - I should have time, it's a quarter till and the Training doesn't resume till 6 o'clock, right? Somebody says no, it's starting at 5.50. O dear. Well, then, I'll stay till then and I can do something. However, we've been hearing noises from another part of the school for a bit - and now I can see flames from a part of the building we can see through our windows, and people are shouting "Fire!" at a distance. We'd better do something.
