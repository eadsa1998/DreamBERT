I was driving and I went to Morley shops. I parked in the underground carpark and went to a computer room. There was a computer free next to Eugene. He was playing Warcraft. I tried to load up World of Warcraft, but after 15 minutes it still hadn't loaded. I went to leave. I couldn't remember how to get back to the carpark. There was a mini emergency room. A guy was then with me and we were trying to find this other carpark.
