A party was being had at my home. Many of my friends were present. Cannot account for what friends were there. Another friend, whom I found extremely irritating, came to say goodbye for he was departing somewhere. My boyfriend became very jealous and began to fight with this person. Never again did I see or hear from this irritating friend.
