I was with Mom and at first we were at a place with Porky. She was running around and then we had to leave and I told Mom that Porky was out, and she told me it wasn't her that she was in the boat or something. I ended up jumping out of this cart and running back to get her. Then Mom and I were at a fair place. We went on a freaky ride with lots of old people. I said to Mom that I was going to sit on the edge, but some old lady had taken my spot, so Mom sat down elsewhere. I thought I would have to sit next to someone else, but a seat was free next to her.
