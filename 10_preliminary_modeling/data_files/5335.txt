Last night I dreamed that tee had been emailing me a lot in the spring and wanted to see me again. But the school was shutting down because a basilisk, like in Harry Potter was killing off everyone. The headmaster called an all-school meeting in the chapel and Jay came and sat in my pew. Then I had to babysit the Franks for a few hours. Right before I went home, Jay invited me to a party he was having.
