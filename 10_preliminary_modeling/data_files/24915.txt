I went to summer camp, met a girl who liked my straightforwardness, and she gave me some false eyelashes. I remember thinking I'd forgotten all my hair products. Then I saw a little boy being beat up, so I went over to one of the guys and told him he was a fuck-up. He then asked me if I wanted my head twisted off, and got really pissed. So I told him he had misunderstood my comment, and what I really said was "I wanna fuck you up." So he changed his mind and fell in love with me, and we did this dancing-flying kind of thing. After we did this, I accidentally let go and flew into another room, and changed into a twin of the man in there. Then there was something in there about Dorothy/Judy Garland, but I don't remember. I don't remember the ending. Setting: A summer camp (I'm not sure when/where). Characters: The first girl who I don't know; the little boy I didn't know either; the guy I eventually fell in love with looked a lot like my friend's older brother; the las man and/or Judy Garland seemed familiar. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, scared, in love. I liked the guy I fell in love with. I like having dreams like that, and I love dancing and flying in my dreams.
