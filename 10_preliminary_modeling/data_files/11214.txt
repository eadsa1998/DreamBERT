I was driving along a desolate country road at night. I remember that it was night because I could see the light which my headlights made on the road. I was not going very fast when all of a sudden an old man was in front of the car, and I couldn't stop it. I hit the man and killed him. Immediately a motorcycle policeman drove up beside my car, handed me a piece of paper, told me to sign my name on it. I signed the paper without reading it, and the policeman immediately drove away. I did not know what to do. I returned to the place where I had hit the man, and I was walking this time. As I came to the exact place where I had hit him, the earth under my feet sunk about three feet. I tried to blame the defect in the earth as the cause of the accident.
