 I'm at Carter School. I'm in the 5th or 6th grade classroom playing a game with dice. My friend Queen Billman is there. She is supposed to kiss me as part of the game, but she is embarrassed to. I kiss her on the cheek in a friendly manner. Two 2's are rolled on the dice. People have to connect the dots on the blackboard and find the perimeter of the parallelogram it makes. The sides are 20 and 36 units long. I think the perimeter is 56. I'm wrong. Its' 2.1, or about 1%. I am in a geography class. My geography professor at Brimson, Meg Shine, is the teacher. I get a paper back, on which I did really well. I forgot about the "intermittent zones" in the paper. I have only one pen in my desk. I leave school. I say goodbye to Meg. I am wearing my old black and pink winter jacket. I walk down the hall with my friend Tiny Combs. The school secretary's daughter and two other people look at us as we leave. The steps are wet because they've just been mopped. Tiny and I think a man we lifted weights with, Troy Swanson, might be teaching first grade, but he is not. Some karate guy is teaching first grade, and is playing Mettalica. I go back to my truck in the parking lot. A classmate named Cory Pineman looks like he wants a ride. My friend Brian Candle walks by. We chat. My friends Tim and Niles Zelling, Nat Miller, and Hilary Nano show up. I greet them. Nat looks like he is mentally retarded. He is really tired from the plane ride. We go to my house.
