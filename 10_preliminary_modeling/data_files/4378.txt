["Purified water."] I travel to my parents' new house, out in the country. It's another family reunion. I walk through the house to see the new remodel they did. First I look outside and see several small fuzzy ponies being ridden by some kids and a young couple. The girl is sitting on the shoulders of the man. Then I turn and go into the new kitchen room. It is huge, square and has many cabinets and cupboards. I see a small warming stove and coffee brewing station. I say hey, she finally created the thing she's wanted for so long. There are several dishwashers, including the original one in the original kitchen next to this new kitchen. Two male cousins are there and we talk about the special purified water they drink for good health. I open a file folder I'd had for years and pull out some packets of water in pouches in brochures. Old ones the cousin gave me years ago One cousin and I decide to go for a bike ride and he gives me a plastic device I can suck the water out of as we ride We go up a tree with the bike and over the country side. The water is the main topic of conversation. It is really a healthy habit to have. The cousin talks about water guru he's studied with.
