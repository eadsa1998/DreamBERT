On a steamer. It's been pretty rough. I am walking on deck wearing winter coat. I throw it back, revealing blue figured slip. At breakfast only a few there. Neighbor at left, a semi-strange lady crowds me. Suggest she moves a little. I am at a corner table. My brother has come. I hurry out to meet E., kiss him, bring him in, ask lady her name so I can introduce him. She says it very queerly, make it out as Gahn-Dibb-Lee. Introduce her to mother, E., but Jr. Gets up before E. can so there is some confusion. By this time, there is quite a crowd in the dining room. Wonder if mother will suggest family prayers and invite all these strangers to stay if they want to.
