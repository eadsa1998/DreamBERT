We're in like a little card room eating a deep dish pizza (my favorite). The room is totally green except for one brown table. All of a sudden I was in New York walking down 5th Ave. with my mom. She put me on a bench and told me something like, "Stay here and watch out." She told me she was going to go get a pizza from my favorite pizza place in New York. So I waited. Wow, now that I think back, I was standing up the whole time because there was no benches available. Anyway, so I finally see a bench and there is a man sitting there. I sit down and he gets so hyper and is jumping everywhere, he says my name and then I somehow knew it was an uncle I don't usually see who we talked a lot about at dinner last night. So we were so happy. Then my mom arrived and said, "Uncle B.!" then I don't remember anything else. Setting: In a green room, and in New York, my favorite place. I always want to go. It was on 5th Ave. near a bench. Characters: My mom, my sister, and my uncle who I never see (and over dinner last night we talked a lot about him). Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, relaxed, bored. I was pretty relaxed, but happy that I was going to get my favorite pizza from my favorite place in New York, but I was bored while I was waiting, too. The weird thing is my uncle. We talked about him last night but I never see him. When I woke up the first thing I thought was "am I late for school?" Then I realized it was a Saturday! The dream seemed so long and had so much action in it.
