I was in Rivertown. I was by my old schoolhouse of my boyhood days. There were some flowers and also sunflowers growing on top of the schoolhouse roof. I looked at the street I lived on and I seemed to be living there again. We had a horse. And Judy took a walk to visit a lady friend. I walked there later and Judy was walking in the mud. At first I thought she was walking barefooted, but she walked toward me and she had on my big shoes and walked on top of the mud. I was going to walk home. I found a good file lying on the street. I put it under my arm, then I found a knife. Then I saw a lot of tools lying on the ground. Marge Rudis was the party Ann was visiting and Frank had all his tools scattered around by his son Alan. I told Marge she had better tell Alan not to leave the tools on the street because the school children walk by and will pick them up. I was listening to a foreign woman talk. She could talk quite good American. I also helped her by interpreting some of my father's language from Slovak to American.
