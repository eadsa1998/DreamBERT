[After Utah trip, I think the next weekend - April 26.]  I was in my truck and Dave was driving.  We were traveling, like in Utah, but it was off the highway, felt like outside of Las Vegas.  It was late night, after midnight.  We stopped for gas or something, and afterward, we were backing up or going out, and some thieves or criminals were approaching or threatening, like they were going to mug us, or carjack.  We were in a bad area, we knew already it was unsafe, and I really just wanted to leave, get far away.  Dave got real aggressive, wanted to confront them.  He got out and had a gun, approached them.  I was watching through the windshield.  I saw him go up to them, he said something aggressive to them, and pulled his gun on them.  They pulled out guns too.  I thought, well this is it, we're both going to get shot.  This is where I will die, right now.  I was anticipating getting shot.  I didn't want to watch.  I put a pillow up in front of my whole face and body so I wouldn't have to see it happening.  I was also thinking about how I'd picked the wrong guy to be with, how Dave was being so violent, controlling, angry and aggressive [although he is the opposite in reality], and I didn't want him, I was sick of him.
