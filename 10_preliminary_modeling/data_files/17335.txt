Dreamt about being around a rock.  There was a group of us.  There was a couple, first supposed to be my parents when they were young, later my boyfriend Jeremy and me.  We tipped a rock and slid down it.  There was a mummy living in white rock.  He had braces and was excited about some mouth thing- a guard or dentures or something.  Still, we had to be careful.  One small ravine over another mummy cavern.  The mummies met and fell in love.  Then, there was a new episode of Night Court.  Bette Midler was supposed to be one of the characters.  They all had defects.  Bette I think was supposed to be Markie Post's character Christine.  Her arms were stuck inside her outfit/mask.  Bull took off a mask to reveal a gross ring for a head.   He had a brother with the same affliction.  His brother pulled off the mask of Roz.  Dan, we discovered, was not as tall as I had thought.  It was an illusion because he was levitating.  In Harry's office, a gray cat sat on a ledge to the right of a picture.  His tail slinked down into a lock.  Everyone left and I went and looked in the safe.  It contained an old book- the book Dan wanted.  Two pages had been torn free of the worn old thing.  I started to read.  'When the people chant your name, your power will be unlimited....' Two names were specifically mentioned, one being Laroquette (not Fielding), including some history- someone from La Roque.  I saw somewhere a screen with a line diagram.  Then there was a commercial.  I was lying on my stomach in front of the TV.  My parents, my maternal Grandma Jane, and my boyfriend Jeremy were there.  The commercial showed a woman taking off layers of something, like the layers of a prosthetic limb, I thought, for some reason.  It was netting.  Chair, chest cover with straps over the arms and ankles- sun protection, and I was thinking Jeremy would probably want me to have one.
