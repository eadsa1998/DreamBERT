At a party with many people. Dance closely with L. (from Vienna, father's colleague, gay). Wonderful feeling. I explore many hidden rooms, find clothes and towels. Tempted to steal some but resist. Then go down to a lake where I see an old woman with grey hair who speaks German. "I took my analysis very seriously, a long time ago." "When was that?" "A long time ago in Zurich!" I gasp. "You mean, you were analyzed by Jung himself?" She nods and smiles but does not answer any more questions. She just sits and watches me. Then I walk along a plank that had new steps leading back to the house! Path was rerouted.
