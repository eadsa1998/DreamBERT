I was typing a paper for my friend John. Actually I was using a computer and it was outside in my backyard. It started to get dark so I went inside. Then I remembered that I had left the disk outside. I got up and went out to get it. Suddenly a neighbor approached me and asked if the computer were for sale. I replied with a no. Then his wife and child came across the street. My father, who had been drinking, invited them into the backyard. The child ran around and played while my mom and dad talked with his parents. We heard thunder and it began to rain, so, everyone went home.
