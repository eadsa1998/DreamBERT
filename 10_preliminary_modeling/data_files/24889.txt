I don't remember any details about this dream. I just know they were going to draft 7 women in the army (Vietnam war) and they went down the line of women and said, "Do you want to fight for your country?" I wasn't in the dream. It was like I was watching it happen. Setting: I have not a clue. I didn't recognize anything. Characters: I didn't know anyone. Feelings and Thoughts: I wasn't in it - it was like stating facts, there were no feelings. We're studying the Vietnam war in school. Who was drafted. Some girls have been saying the draft was sexist because no women were allowed to go!
