I can't remember properly, but I had been dating some guy. We had to break up for some reason. I had this person/creature for some experiment. It got to the car and then we took it back. Some other people had better facilities and he decided to leave us to go with them. In the car I begged him (the creature) to come back. I was upset. I found out something and I was on Facebook and was trying to type an apology to Elijah because we had dated, although I wondered why I hadn't remembered about it before now.
