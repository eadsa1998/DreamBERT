This guy was sleeping with a friend of his called Claire. Her boyfriend was suspicious and showed the guy a video of them having sex to see if he got jealous. She was also sleeping with a girl and there was a video of them using a dildo with two ends. The guy was telling someone about it and that he had had sex with a guy even though he thought that was disgusting. Mom was going for a drive. Ezra and I went along. We saw Lydia, Naomi (who was fat) and another fat girl walking in white shirts and black pants/shorts. I slipped and ended up on top of the car. We all went to the shop, along with Dad. There was an escalator that led to a clothes shop. Safety Dance came on and I started singing it. Ezra showed me photos of us when we were kids and he used to be called Leroy but it was pronounced 'shay shay'. There was a That's Life story about William H. Macy, who was from here. He, a guy and a girl, had dug a hole in this prison cell to get underground. There was a hole in the door and they came up but one hole got closed. The girl was a bit fat and couldn't fit. They all got out though.
