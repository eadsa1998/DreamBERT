It was very close to my birthday and that Samantha, Sandra and Derek and I think Mickie were in town, again too, but this time I think it was only Samantha, Sandra and Derek, and there were an extra friend or two in the house, but none of the spouses. And they were all in our living room kind of sitting around and lazing around like they do. And I think Mom and Dad were somewhere in the house. And I think they were all trying to get a surprise together for me because they were wanting me to go over to the pool and swim at the pool for a while and leave them be at home. And in my dream this pool was located kind of in the same place that Circle Lake is, so it was only a hop and a skip away. Somehow I crossed the street and everything. So I put on my bathing suit, head out the back door, walk down the alley and go over to the pool, and I swim at the pool. And I would come home early and I would do everything I could to be quiet. I would leave the pool gate very carefully, I would sort of walk slowly down the alley and into the back, but Dad would always be working in the garage and he would always see me coming home. So I would come in the house and say hi to everybody and then go back to the pool. So I did that a couple of times, like three times. And the last time I came in, I was pretty sure I saw them wrapping something, or something like that, and then they were going to pile in the car and go somewhere. I'm not sure where; it couldn't have been a restaurant because we had food in the car that we were eating. I had my 7-eleven cup that spills if you just breathe on it the wrong way. I had some kind of food that I was trying to eat and trying not to let it spill. All the girls were in the back, Mom was next to me and Derek was driving, and Dad wasn't around. Whoopee! And Derek was driving well, I mean we were just going on an adventure, having fun, and I woke up before we ever got where we were supposed to go.
