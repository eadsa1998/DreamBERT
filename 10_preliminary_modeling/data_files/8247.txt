I was with a bunch of members of my family. We were at a public park. Mother had to use the restroom. The rest of us stayed in the vehicle. I think it was a van or something because there was a lot of us. Daddy kept driving around. A couple of times he drove by this place that had cement statues or something like that. The second time it was like I was remembering something that happened around there I don't know exactly how to describe that part. Daddy started getting upset because he didn't know what was taking Mother so long. I was thinking that he just needed to stay in one place where she could find us. He finally decided to drive back to where he dropped her off and just sit there and wait. Bob F and I said we would go in and see if she needed help. Then I suggested to Daddy that maybe it would be better if he went in because he was used to helping her and she would probably be more comfortable with him helping her than us. But then she came out, so she didn't need any help. Now it seems that she went in because there was something that she needed to type and post there. While she was doing that I found a little area where they had some small statues and a candle. The candle was like a tea candle in a container that was shaped kind of like an upside down ice cream cone. I lit it. Someone said something about the fact that I shouldn't light it. I thought it would be fine because it was in this container. But then as we were doing that some people had come up and were trying to read it while we were still hanging it and while I was lighting the candle.
