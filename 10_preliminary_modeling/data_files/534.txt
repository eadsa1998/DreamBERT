I am pregnant and have to pay some kind of thing by going to the hospital and eating some soup and three large rolls if I want to keep the baby. The food is at some lower level of the hospital and it is difficult to get to. A woman is with me and helps me get there. I get the soup down but I know there is no room for all the rolls and I am worried about what will happen.
