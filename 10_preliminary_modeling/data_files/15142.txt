I was friends with the characters in How I Met Your Mother. For a long time, Marshall and I would end up making out but stopping before it got too far because of Lily. We were making out in bed and it was very passionate and tongue-y. Then we stopped. There was a mention at some point about a possible threesome. I was then in a car with Mom and others. An ambulance went by with flashing lights and a siren and it did a big turnaround. We turned down a street and there were some guys on the side of the road. There were lists of top 5 games for each game company. GTA IV was on one and another was some 'maternal paternal' game. I was trying to find it online to see what it was about.
