I dreamt that I was to attend a Spanish class at 7:30 at night. I had to go to my room in the dormitory to get my books. I remember taking an escalator to the 2nd floor and meeting a girl on the escalator. I told her to wait for me. When I got to the 2nd floor, I opened the door to my room and discovered it was a classroom. I was very confused. I tried some of the other doors on the floor, but they were all locked. I decided to take an elevator down to the first floor, but here the dream gets rather confused. I seemed to be swinging through hoops. I remember thinking it was like some ride at E. Beach.
