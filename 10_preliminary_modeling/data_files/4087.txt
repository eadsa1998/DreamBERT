["Sex In A Closet"]  I am in my wheelchair. It is after dinner and Paulina's "husband" nods to her, indicating he's ready to have sex. He and Paulina and I go into a closet like room. I am supposed to be there while they have sex. I busy myself looking at things in a cluttered box of junk. I see a glimpse of his briefs as I try not to observe. He is standing up as she is spread eagle on the table. I feel very uncomfortable and remind myself to ask Paulina if it's all right if I don't attend these after dinner quickies. I see syringe needles from Fluffy's shots, some Xmas cards, one from a cousin, perhaps Darcy, Deirdre or Beverly to Charla. Charla never responds to her. I am throwing away the old cards. I decide to dump the whole box, but I see 3 necklaces. Jade marbles with dragon claws on them. I decide to keep them. Jake asks if I should ask Rigo to help me with my dream software since Ricardo isn't being helpful. I laugh and say with strong sarcasm, Goodness No. Rigo is an idiot with computers and will really mess it up. Now Paulina's "husband" is done. I'm surprised it's so quick. Paulina sure didn't get any pleasure. He's dressed again, wearing a black pants, black vest and pink shirt with a ruffle on it. He sighs contentedly like he's had a good meal and pats his tummy
