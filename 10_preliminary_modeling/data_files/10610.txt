I have special powers. I make myself tall and pretty and make my house (which isn't my real house) look really cool. It has black and white checkers and strobe lights. I made Bon Jovi show up and we kissed. All I had to do was say, "Bon JOVI!" and point my finger and he'd appear. I could do anything. Then my Dad was pissed off and everyone had a good dinner. My brother and his friend were there and I asked them what I had eaten. They said they didn't know, but if I had to eat it, I'd throw up. I found out I didn't have to eat anything. My parents wanted me to at least sit at the table. So I ran to my friend Linda's house. She wasn't home, so I went looking for her with someone. I forget who. We went to this building that I think was a mental institute because we kept going up and down stairs and all we could see were gray, corroded, damp, ugly rooms. It was awful. My psychiatrist and old counselors were going to catch us. I knew what this hotel was like, but I couldn't find it. Then we saw one of my aunts and some other people who helped us find it. We finally found it and it was mega cool. We sat down to eat dinner. Then I asked someone where Leslie was and they pointed to a room. I went there and couldn't get up. I kept wondering how she got her wheelchair up there, but her Mom tells me she forgot about the flap. So she lets it down and I went up and sat there for a while and then went down. I said good-bye and ate dinner.
