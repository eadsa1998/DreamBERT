I first dream that I am at the French Square in a protest march, in the center of Lima. All the students are shouting and then you can hear the police siren and I see policemen come blowing their whistles. The people run, the girls cry, and I (don't know why) was left standing there all alone. Moments later I realized that I was alone. the last thing I remember is that I went home.
