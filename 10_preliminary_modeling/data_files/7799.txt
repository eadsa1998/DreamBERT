I was inside this house. It was a big fancy house. There was a party there. The owner of the house was Dabney Coleman. I think he's kind of gross. We were in this house and he made a pass at me. Then he took me into his bedroom, but there were all these other people in there. Actually, the bedroom was kind of like a very large suite of rooms with no doors, just large openings between areas. It was almost as though it was partitioned off rather than having walls. It was very contemporary. Everything had very contemporary curvy lines to them. I really don't know how to explain this at all. Anyway, he chased all the people out. I whispered something to him. I realized there were more people in there still. He was trying to get all of them out. When he finally got them all out, we realized his wife was there. She was talking to him and flirting with him physically as though nothing was going on. She didn't see me there. I tried to sneak out and she saw me. I ran out the door and instead of running down two flights of steps, I jumped over the rail and landed two floors down. I thought I was safe there but she threw something and it hit me. I just kept running.
