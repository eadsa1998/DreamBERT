I dreamed that I was getting on a bus. I don't remember where I was going. I was walking to the back of the bus and I saw my sister with her friends sitting in the very back. I asked her where she was going because I noticed she had a bag with her. Just then she jumped up and yelled, "Leave me alone!" and stabbed me in the eye with a pair of scissors.
