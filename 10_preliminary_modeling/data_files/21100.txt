Our cupboard was overloaded with dishes. They were handing out over the shelves. I took an old style kerosene lamp off the ladder and put it on the table. I saw a _______ in the night sky I saw stars. I saw faces of women and a man float thru the sky. The man had a mustache. I saw a number on a side of a clock. It was #3225. This sight frightened me. I was flying as Johnny Kolesar walked. There seemed to be a picnic in the woods. Kotnik threw something at me. I was above him. I threw fruit at him from the air and hit him. He ran away.
