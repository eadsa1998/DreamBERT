 I walk with my mom and my siblings on the sidewalk in front of the white house at the intersection of 1st Street and Holy Avenue in Oak Valley. We're going up to the house. There is a short metal fence around the house, and its gate may be locked. My sort-of girlfriend Stephanie Peterson and her friend are sitting in the back yard by the garage. She yells for us to come over. We go and say hi and talk <br/
