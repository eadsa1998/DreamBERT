Obviously it's a rainy day. Last night I had kind of a strange dream before huge claps of thunder woke me up, and I must've been hearing rain in my dream because it played into my dream in a funny way. I dreamt that our house was just a little bigger than it is, and our living room was huge and kind of intersected with our porch in a way. There wasn't that wall there. And Mom was sleeping out in the living room with some big pillows and Dad was like, "Are you sleeping out here because the roof's leaking in the bedroom?" And Mom was like, "No, I'm just sleeping out here because there's such a nice breeze, so I really appreciate it." And then we found out that the roof was leaking in the bedroom and he got so mad that she wouldn't tell him. But instead of roof in my dream, they were talking about the fact that the door was leaking. I don't know why. And let's see; what else? Then after that I was walking around the house getting some stuff out of the kitchen and stuff, and this naked man with a guide dog was going through the house. And I had never seen him before. And I got the impression like he was staying with us or something. And his dog was black, and his shoulders came up to my chest, like a little bigger than they usually are, and was like sniffing me. And the guy was saying, "Come on. Come on." And he just kept walking through our house for some reason. And I was supposed to go down in the cellar to get our party mix that I was going to take to the party today, but they only had this little tiny, little bitty light bulb up in the ceiling of the cellar and it wasn't making much light at all and it was real dark outside. And I told Mom, "I'm not going to go down there unless you change the bulb and make it its full brightness." And I don't think I ever did get down there to get my cereal, I don't know, but I was real glad that all of this was a dream.
