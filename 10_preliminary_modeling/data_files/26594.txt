 I'm talking with my friend Tony Kramer outside of Carter School. He tells me he's failing his classes in college: not doing well. I walk into school in my underwear, which are briefs. I'm beginning to get an erection and am self-conscious about my nearly naked state. I go in to get my green warm up pants. I get them and feel less embarrassed when I'm clothed. I'm in a first grade classroom. I come in late. We have to pick partners. My friend Matt Yams is there, among many others. I'm one of the last people to get a partner. I'm a partner with the short happy woman from the library at the University of Wellington.
