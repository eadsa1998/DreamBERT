Fragment: Walking along a down town street, I come to an intersection. Though the traffic light is red, I determine (in a spirit of bravado) to cross against it, especially as there are no police in sight. I walk across, but just as I reach opposite walk, I notice a policeman standing a few feet away, watching me with a half contemptuous, half amused smile.
