I was in some kind of trouble with some colored people. A couple of colored men did something to a train, some damage or then ran it without permission. I saw them doing it so I was going to call the police and they knew I was. So I started to run, then fly in flight. I flew over the colored neighborhood. Some young colored boys saw me and tried to catch me, but I stayed out of their reach. The wind started to blow and I had a hard time flying against. it.
