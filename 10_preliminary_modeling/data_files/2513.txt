I'm at a convention for disabled people, a big crowd. I watch the entertainment. I look down at my legs and see large pink buttons had been sewn on to them. I am very surprised and asked Ellie when this happened. Surely I'd remember such a painful event. She and I discuss different times it could have happened. I see a rock group and go up to them. The lead singer/guitarist is a mean guy that wants me. I don't like him and walk away. He follows me, very demanding and pushy. Ellie likes him and I say, "But you don't understand, he nearly raped me. He's horrible!"
