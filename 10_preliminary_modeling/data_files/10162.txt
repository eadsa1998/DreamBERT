Gary (a friend from Church) is standing in the street underneath a street lamp, with a large afghan type scarf around his neck; I ask: "Where shall we go?" and he says: "we'll see." We start walking in park, slightly uphill; it is pleasant evening, and overhead there's millions of bright stars, and I see an especially bright star on my right.... I wake up before I know where we are going.
