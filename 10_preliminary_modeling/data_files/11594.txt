The dream started in a ship. Some people and I were walking some prisoners. Five escaped. A man who I did not recognize shoved a gun in my hand. I then had the feeling of safety and reassurance. Scene changed to the main floor of a large department store. Up to now all persons in dream were male, unknown to me and ages were not observed. In the store I saw one of the persons we were chasing. I then realized that he was a good friend of mine. The person who was with me and seeking the prisoners was unknown and older than me (between 30 and 40). My friend (the prisoner) was walking down a flight of stairs from the second floor to the first floor. I saw his head over a show case. The scene now had my friend in a show case. I talked to him but I couldn't hear what I said. I took the gun and squeezed the trigger. The gun may have shot and it may not have. At the time I didn't think it did. My friend then said he was sorry and that he was glad to have known me. Then he said goodbye. Then the scene changed. I was in a strange bed. My mother woke me and told me my friend had died on the way to the hospital. I started to sob. Then I began to wonder whether I had shot my friend or not.
