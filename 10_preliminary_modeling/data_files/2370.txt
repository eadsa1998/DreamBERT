I'm in a small boat in the huge ocean. I'm lost and drifting. A huge Navy ship comes over and a military officer who looks like Paul Newman comes aboard and finds me. I'm nearly dead from lack of food and water. He asks me how much food I had left and I point to a few scraps. I feel superior because I know I'm not a goner yet. So resourceful! He brings me on board the ship. I go to his "office." Someone has projected his face up on the clouds and is throwing a ball (soccer) up at him. His hands move clumsily and can't catch the ball. This is supposed to prove there is no God, and if there were, he isn't it. This is damaging to him. He must find the culprit. I know how, but he won't believe me, so I and another woman take over. We call the accused in. I tell him he must sit facing all of us for 3/4 of an hour. The crowd groans because they figure it's a waste of time. I shorten it to 1/2 hour and tell him how if he plays games with us and waits us out, it will go bad at the trial. He will have proven his guilt. Then as he sits there, I explain how it is best if he just tells us the truth. What he doesn't know is that I and the other woman are psychic and are taking notes on his internal responses and we know the whole story.
