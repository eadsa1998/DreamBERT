Shortly after connecting with this man and after a phone conversation with Matthew I said I really needed to get more serious about joining the YMCA, knowing how much better I'll feel after I do. I just got done talking on the phone with Matthew and after I finished talking on the phone with this man I immediately drove to PLU to see Matthew. He was having some problems with his skin. He had this red blotchy. something. all over his skin. He was somewhat successful cooling it with some hand lotion he found at the YMCA. I did kind of the same thing as soon as I heard what they were saying. I went and took a hot shower and felt so much better instead of the lotion. But I noticed in a mirror that it was all red splotches, like hives. We discussed calling an ambulance but for whatever reason we didn't. And then, uh, first thing I. is when some of them did and the next day was Christmas.
