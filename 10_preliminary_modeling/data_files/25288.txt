 I'm at Grocery Getto. I'm a cart pusher. The weather is pretty bad. There are a few of us cart pushers. We are working hard to build the wall of carts. Inside the cart room there are two little rubber markers on the floor that need to be turned at the proper angles so the carts are straight. My boss Jack Krane is in the cart room with us. I align the markers correctly while he watches. I am working on a Friday, 4-10pm. Jack and I walk into the store eating bananas. He motions for me to hide my banana, because we shouldn't be eating in the store. Another manager, Darma Mantle, is there. She walks by me as I am up near the front of the store getting hot chocolate and marshmallows. She asks me what I'm working. I tell her 4-10pm. Another employee, Sandra Cauly, who looks and sounds like the woman on the movie White Men Can't Jump, is on the intercom paging the courtesy employees out to the cart room to get rid of some weed. She pages twice, and the word "weed" rings out. It seems strange that she would use that word.
