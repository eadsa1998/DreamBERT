I looked at the clock and checked my watch. Almost 10 a.m. Why hadn't they called me? I missed breakfast and couldn't get to church in time. I put on my robe and went to dining room. On other side of long table were three maids. I asked if breakfast was over. One said she's get me something. I protested and she thanked me for helping her clean. I remembered I had picked up small objects from the floor. There was a half-filled glass of water at my place. She brought me a well-browned piece of chicken on a long roll. It tasted good even if I had nothing to put on bread. I mustn't eat butter. Looked at end of dining room expecting Mrs. McK (she was s practical nurse who treated us if were three years old) who was sitting there to ball me out but she was concentrating on some papers.
