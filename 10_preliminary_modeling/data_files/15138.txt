I was watching Lost. I was with someone out the back of an old house. Ben was an alien or something and someone said he was hot. Someone could do a weird thing with their eyes. Sam (Supernatural) was with Daryl. She was angry at him and he wouldn't go with us because he wanted to wait. Jack said someone was coming. We were in a shed and someone used an ability to 'hide' us. A girl came in and said she couldn't see anyone. Jack said we couldn't go yet. We needed to find a way to time travel and choose a different option so nothing on the island ever happened. Then it turned into Supernatural. Sam and Dean needed to try and get close to Driveshaft during a performance and play the guitar. Neither of them knew how to play, but had memories that could activate it. Dean said 'for me to concentrate, you can't be looking at me like that and can you put some pants on'. Then Sam was working in a car in a garage.
