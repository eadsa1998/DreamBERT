I think that I was buying or had already bought a house with someone else. We were working on cleaning it up I guess. On the property there was an old run-down trailer in what was supposed to be the front yard. The people before had been using it as an office specifically to do writing. And there was something about, maybe it was mostly teenagers or young people who had used it. I don't know what this is but there's an image of five documents laid out on a table. Three in one row and then two directly above. One directly above the middle one and then another directly above the one to the left.
