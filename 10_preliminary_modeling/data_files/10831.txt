I was going to a baseball game at the stadium. I was to meet a friend there at 3 o'clock but the game started at 2. I kept thinking that I should get ready to go to the game, but I never quite got dressed. I then found myself at a dinner at Stouffer's Restaurant at Shaker Square. At this dinner were several of my classmates from Mather. I remember seeing an elderly woman there who was in my Spanish class. We conversed in several minutes and then I heard my mother asking me what the score of the Ohio State game was. I couldn't remember the score, but I said someone made along run. The conversation then turned to the subject of a fraternity at Shaw High School called Phacoms. We talked about how may of them were married.
