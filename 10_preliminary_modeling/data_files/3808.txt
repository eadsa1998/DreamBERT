["Bee Sting and smelly dog shit."] I am driving down a freeway and notice the traffic is coming at me. They are going the wrong way. I pull off on the left side of the road and get out. I walk down a steep embankment to a park area, very confused. I keep looking at the traffic and saying to myself, but it should be going the other way right? I look across the park and see the other side of the freeway and the traffic is going in the same direction as the traffic on my side. This is strange. I decide I have to go to the bathroom and walk down a path. I see many piles of dog shit and the odor is strong. It is smelly shit. Lots of bees are swarmed around it and as I step over the shit, one stings me on the leg. I call out One of them stung me. Then I see the rest are hovering over and around my leg and I can't shake them. I feel some fear. I try hard to shake them off and keep moving. I finally manage to shake them away and return back to the freeway. Now I see that some cars are going the right way but it is dangerous because there is still traffic coming from the wrong direction.
