A man named Keith likes me and comes on sexually. I am drawn to him. Our lips nearly meet and I suddenly pull away, still wanting him but confused. I say "No. I am married." He smiles and says, "You want it; why don't we go away? There are lots of big rooms with fireplaces." I am tempted, but refuse and pull away. He starts to leave and I realize that I am not married and regret rejecting him, but it is too late. [BL]
