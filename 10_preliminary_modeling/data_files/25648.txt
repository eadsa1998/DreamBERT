 My roommate Stephen Ramos and I are in our room. He is sleeping. Our room is in our current dorm, but it is down the hall where my friends Fran and Anna's room is. A male student opens the door. I am surprised. I go out and close the door behind me. The student is with a prospective first year student and her mother. The girl opens the door to look in the room. I close it again and tell her I'll show her another room, not ours. A classmate I have a crush on, Jackie Hunter, walks by, going to a room. I say to the girl, "Stop it". I didn't mean for this to sound like I was speaking to Jackie, because I was speaking to the girl so she wouldn't open the door again. Jackie is going to study in a room across the hallway from ours. She looks different. She has dreadlock-like hair. My friends Nat Miller and Norman Noman are there. A woman named Bola is her roommate. I show the girl a room down the hall, (which is actually where our room is).
