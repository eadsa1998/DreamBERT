I'm in a big city with friends from India [I introduced myself to them on a university campus in 1954]. They drive up to curb and we three get out, and it's an Indian celebration. Suddenly a bigger truck--theirs is a pick-up--and suddenly their children get in the big truck and drive away--both about 8-10 years old. We follow and I don't ask where we go or if they are kidnapped and it's an adventure and no fear.
