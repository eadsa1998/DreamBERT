I was walking down a strange (unknown) street with a companion (also unknown; even the sex is vague). Amongst all the strange houses I spied one that seemed perfectly familiar and started to enter. Then for some reason I began to be afraid and hung back. My companion scoffed at me and prodded me on, but I refused to enter. Then a blank followed and a short time later I was in a perfectly familiar room but could not place it. This made me angry so I tried to leave. However, I couldn't get out. Upon awakening, the room still seemed familiar, but still I could not specifically identify or place it.
