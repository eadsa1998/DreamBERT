I had a dream that we were doing the proctor switch. Hannah and I lived on Bundy 3 and our proctors were taking us down to the lake to take a walk. There was a huge octopus that lived on Bundy 1. His tentacles were blocking all the doors. On the way up from the walk, the proctors were throwing worms. It was horrible. When we got up to school, Sue was baking Krispy Kremes. Then I woke up.
