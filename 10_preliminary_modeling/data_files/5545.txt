[1997-05-09] There are people present in my house, some that I know and some that I don't. But I decide that I want to take a nap and its about 3:00 in the afternoon. So I go upstairs to my bed and I sleep. When I wake up things are all mixed up. I look at my watch, it says ten minutes to seven, and I think about the people and I think I better get up and go downstairs. I again look at my Braille watch and there's a third hand in it and the third hand makes it read like its 4:00, but then this other hand makes it look like ten to seven and so I'm not sure if its ten of seven or 4:00 and I said, "I don't remember there being a second hand on my watch". I went down stairs and I asked if anybody was going to cook anything and nobody wanted to do anything and my sister was there and she said "well I don't know", but I was hungry and I was wondering if we should call out and get some food delivered, but I was also thinking of cooking, but I couldn't decide what to do so I said "I'm going to bed". So I went to bed and I was trying to sleep and I was trying to wake up and I was so tired. When I touched my dog, there was like a pocket on her, a shallow slide pocket where you would hide something very thin in, it was made of fur, but when I put my hand in it it didn't seem to bother her and I thought this was pretty strange to see this on my dog, it didn't seem like an injury to her and I couldn't figure that out. My pillow was all drooley when I woke up.
