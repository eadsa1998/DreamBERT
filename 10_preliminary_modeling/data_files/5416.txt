I had the worst dream last night: that Aaron and Britta got back together. Aaron really wanted me to meet Britta, and I wanted to meet her, but it was really upsetting for me to see them together. They were kissing and cuddling and laughing right in front of me, and I could tell they were really in love. Britta would talk, and Aaron would just gaze at her, and I felt so...wasted. I was so upset and mad, but I wanted Aaron to be happy too. And Britta was smart and pretty; I felt like I couldn't compare. I got so fed up and couldn't watch them together, so I left. Then I woke up.
