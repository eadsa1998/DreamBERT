I'm in a sort of attic, a partially finished loft, where there are some old things stored, especially childrens' things - it all looks like the turn of the century or perhaps up to the 20's - I'm looking for something, and I'm setting up some books that have fallen over. While I'm at it, I'm sorting them for size, just because, why not? I'm near the ladder down to the next floor, and someone down there (a man) is speaking to me, wanting to know if I need any help - he's concerned about me being up here alone, wants me to be careful on that ladder. I'm quite all right, everything's just fine.
