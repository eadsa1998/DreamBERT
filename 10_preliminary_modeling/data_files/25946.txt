 Basketball is being played at Armstrong High School. I'm there with some of my old teammates, and some of the new players. Coach Jackson is there. I am left with the new team and Coach Jackson, while the other guys went somewhere to scrimmage or play. I feel out of place. I'm not involved. I want Coach Jackson to incorporate me but at the same time I'm much older than the new team, and I feel out of place. Track runners are there practicing on the indoor track. My sister Ramona, college classmate Bernice Grovner, old teammate Ron Lind, high school classmate Mark Raden, and others are there. I'm in a different gymnasium area where a young man is practicing running the 400. He is the only person there. He has a camera that is set up to take a photograph of him as he completes the run, to time him. I run on the track a bit to warm up. I'm pretty stiff, and out of shape. I get two Polaroid photographs of Ramona and I when I run.
