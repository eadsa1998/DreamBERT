I was standing on the porch and thinking I was not happy with my life or the vocation I had. I said, 'I think I would be happier with my wife I would divorce her." Then I was thinking all the bills I had and I am not doing the vocation that would make me happy. Then my sister Mary and brother Steve were there and Ann came out. I took her in my arms and hugged her close and kissed her about five or six times. Once I kissed her with our two noses touching, which was hard to do.
