I realize I'm going on stage in 45 minutes and I thought I'd have my script with me, but I won't. I say to Jock sheepishly, "I haven't memorized my lines." He is very upset and disgusted with my lazy unprofessionalism. I pick up the pages, hanging on a wire, each page in a plastic sheet protector, and go away with the intent of committing it all to memory in 45 minutes. I do it, but it is very intense and concentrated work.
