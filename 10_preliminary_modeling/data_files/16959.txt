In this dream my house is on the same street as my childhood home. My neighbor is my real neighbor: a Londoner called Len. In the dream he has all sorts of trailers parked outside, and strange large bits of metal (perhaps they are cement mixers that fold up). I see him as I'm trying to park. He is parking another large lump of metal. We engage in small talk. I am a bit annoyed with his taking up all the parking space, but I try to remain polite. He doesn't seem to get it, and just chats away.
