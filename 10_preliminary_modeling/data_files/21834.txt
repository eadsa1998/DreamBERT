I was chasing two boys who Bob went along with. They ran thru a field and I ran after them. I jumped over one fence and then another one. There was tall weed or grass. I looked for them in it. I finally found one of them and he told me where the others were. So we all went back and made an agreement and settled the trouble. Later I saw Harold Hilts. He had about five or six diamond rings. He put out his hand and had them on his fingers. I was with Audrey. I looked down and saw a quarter and a nickel. She saw it the same time. I was going to pick up the quarter, but I let Audrey take it and I picked up the nickel. We walked on and I saw a nickel in a hole. I picked it up and looked into a smaller hole and I saw what looked like a quarter. I took a close look and it was a bottle cap. As I was getting up, two of the boys I made an agreement with came upon me and accused me of taking something out of a pan. I saw when I looked at the bottle cap but I didn't bother it. I saw now hurry and look into your hidden item and see if I touched it. We came upon two hunters. A duck took off across the field running in flight. The hunter took aim, but didn't shoot. He thought it was a pheasant. Then there was a flock of ducks or pheasants in flight overhead. He shot at them, but missed. Then I saw a big duck flying by. He didn't shoot at it. Then to our surprise we saw a green tentacle. It was very big. He shot it and missed. He shot, then I held his gun at a hand it held out and missed. Then we saw the monster face. It was big and red. He was taller than the trees and was moving our way. Then there was a mist like in front of him and he couldn't see us. We started to run. We ran fast and then downhill and finally got away from him.
