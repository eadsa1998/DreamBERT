In my dream, the first thing I remember was this very nerdy guy that goes to my school (in my opinion he was the biggest nerd at my school). So, then I saw a girl talking to him, and all of a sudden she kissed him. Just that event was so dramatic to me, I started crying selflessly at what had just happened- a completely beautiful girl kissed this complete geek, and I was so touched by that moment, that I think I fell in love with her on the spot and realized she was the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen. Later I caught up with her at a cafe of some sort, and sat and talked to her, but I didn't want to tell her how much I liked her because she might have thought I was trying to take advantage of her, and with such a nice girl, I wouldn't want to do THAT.
