 I'm at Snow Tubing Hills with my friend Tiny Combs. There is no snow on the ground. Tiny asks me how much it costs for a ride. It costs $12 for one ride and $48 for four rides. I go down twice. It is expensive! Tiny goes off the regular hill, by some trees and rocks. A girl is there named Susie, whom we complain to about the cost. Then we leave.
