I was in a building. There were people in chairs. We had to get into them to imprint something. Xander (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) and someone else from Buffy the Vampire Slayer were there. Ezra was there and I was talking to him about some games. The person next to Xander got up, so I sat there -- it was squishy. Faith talked to me later and told me to tell Xander how I felt.
