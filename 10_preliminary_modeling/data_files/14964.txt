I was at university. I had found something on the net about the results of something to get in to it and I was 10/58. I was in a computer room and Alejandro was next to me. Jakob came in and asked me something and left. Someone else I knew came in and asked me about the stuff at the computer and I said it was Jakob's. They were with people. I mocked someone and I went to do something and hit a gun. It hurt and I started to bleed. My mouth got really bloody. I tried to take a photo of it but it was too hard. Mom said she had made spaghetti and it was ready but then she said she had to "burn a special biscuit" to make it taste the same. I was like 'why do you tease me?'. Darren got a 12 month job with the government which had something to do with traffic signals on a busy road.
