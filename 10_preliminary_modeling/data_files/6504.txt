I was at a party of some sort, with all kinds of people from the Middle School. The crowd at this party is a very select group. They are people from the Middle School, whom I subsequently met, after gradution, under different circumstances. Thus it is an odd collection: Kelly J. and Jasmine are there, as well as that girl named Shannon. Many people who would never mix are here, because I ran into them in later life. Notably absent are most of my infatuations, though I later met some of them. The only one here is Amy. I talk to her for a little while, and she gives me her phone number, tells me to call her, and then, after I talk to Kelly J. a bit more, I dreamt I woke up. But I woke up in some mythical apartment; I did not wake into my real life but into some alternate life. Here I write down the phone number Amy gave me in my dream and after a brief hesitation, I dialed it. A man answered the phone, presumably her father, and I asked for Amy. He got her and we talked for a while. "But how did you find my number?" "Well, it's really wierd... I dreamt you gave it to me." The upshot of the conversation was I was to come and visit her, in the state she had moved to, so we could talk. I promised I'd be there as soon as I could. So I got in a car and drove to her house. She greeted me and showed me her room, and we sat down on the bed and started to talk. We had a lot to say. So much had happened in the meantime. She produced a thick bundle of papers which she had written up for college, which described everything in her life and everything she believed in, everything she wanted to do with her life and so on. I had nothing comparable so I went to the car and retrieved the first five chapters of my novel and gave it to her. We sat on the bed -- I mean laid down, and kissed and exhanged a hug. We looked into each other's eyes a while, and decided that we had made a mistake in ever separating.
