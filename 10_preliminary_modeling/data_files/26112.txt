 I'm working with another man who is either my friend Bubba Hacker, Kevin Simpson, Stephen Ramos, or Jack Thigpen. We are repairing the cross bars at a railroad crossing. We readjust the bars and bolt/screw them back in place. I hope a train doesn't come. If a train does come it will come in the direction of the traffic flow, not parallel to the railroad tracks, but perpendicular to the tracks, on the road.
