I was at 'school'. Evelyn, Calvin and Autumn were around. Elijah and Dmitri were in the library. Eugene and Darius came in. I pointed Darius out to Calvin and we were laughing. Later, they were having a meeting thing at McDonald's. Mom took me there and I changed my mind. She convinced Autumn to come out to the car, so I started it up and went to drive off but it kept rolling even when my foot was right down on the brake. Ezra was there with Rodney.
