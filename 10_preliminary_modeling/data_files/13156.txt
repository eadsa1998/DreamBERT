I went to some shop place. There was this trial thing outside where you can get a couple million points and then cash them in. We had to look for some picture to get points. I wanted to join, but you had to have a shower, and the girls shower was on display, but not the guys. I really wanted to join, but refused to shower. Eventually, the lady let me look inside. There was a clothes section and all the clothes were too small. Ezra was there. She said that I didn't have to shower. I also remembered that Dad's Medicare card was at home.
