In this dream our sofa is pulled out from the wall and is standing in the center of the room, its back facing the kitchen. Mary is lying on the sofa and I can see her in profile. She is sad. Maria, Robert, Adam and I are around her and looking down at her. It seems that she is saying that no one loves her. All of us hasten to assure her that we love her and each of us in turn declares our love for her. Then I name off all of the other people who love her, beginning with her sister, Kathy. She changes the subject and says that she's cold and in distress (much as she was in the latter days of her illness). I ask her if she would like the heating pad. Her face lights up with her beautiful smile, and she replies, "That would be nice." I go over to the hutch to get it when I suddenly realize that I haven't taken the heating pad out of the hutch drawer since Mary died. I'm startled and terribly sad and upset. I'm in two time dimensions at once. I am in the present (or is it the past?) with Mary; and I am also in the future -- in a time after Mary's death. My heart is breaking and I begin to cry uncontrollably. I think I am carrying the heating pad over to Mary, but I'm so overwhelmed by my tears that I'm not clear where she and the children are located.
