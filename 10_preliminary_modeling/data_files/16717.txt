I had a dream that someone told me I missed Christmas- and I balled my eyes out. I was told I'd still get presents and everything, but I kept crying and saying, It's not the same." Actually, this is what I think happened: I was watching something on TV, but it seemed more like I was watching people in the other room on a television-like screen. Then, someone came in and broke the news. I was heartbroken.
