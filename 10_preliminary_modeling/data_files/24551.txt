I was in a pool with my friend Anna, and we were helping babies get into the pool. Then we had to leave and my sister's friend, Jackie, and another girl started doing it. Setting: I don't know. In a pool. Characters: My friend Anna was wearing a magenta bathing suit and Jackie was wearing a white one with a duck on it. I don't remember anything else. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, worried. Well, yesterday I was talking about 1 million babies with my friend Anna and I had gymnastics!
