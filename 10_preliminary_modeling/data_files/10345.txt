Dream about Eli (artist friend from Maine). He is wrapping packages and about to leave town. His daughter is only 6-7 years old. (grown up in reality) She stands on the other side of the street, wearing a black/white printed dress and waves to him but he pays no attention. J. is intent on catching his bus and leaves.
