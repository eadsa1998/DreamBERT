Last night I dreamt of my sister Martha. We were in her bedroom talking a bit angrily, when she stepped backwards and, without realizing it, sat on the bed of my other sister where our cat (who is sick) had defecated. So Martha put her hand right where the cat had defecated and she let out a scream of disgust and surprise.
