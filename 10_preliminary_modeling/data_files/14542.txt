There was a sports thing on. I flew to America and back, but for some reason the ticket made me go back to America. The airport was different. The people at the counter were in water. I asked for the flight home. Mom and Ezra were there and it was now a sports thing for Ezra. There was an assembly thing, but I decided it would be packed and boring and so Mom and I left. Ezra was made to stay. Then I was by myself and I had 'made' stuff, like a ship and something else and a bathroom, but I hadn't set anything, for it to function or whatever. I was then in water, which was inside a building, and it was sometimes a computer game. Then Mom was with me. It was really dark because I hadn't made it properly. I kept going under and it was like neverending so I had trouble getting back up. At some point I was on a computer playing Runescape. Eugene was on the computer next to me (which was facing me) and I stared at him for a bit, thinking he was hot and then went back to my game. We both started humming the same song. Gaius (Battlestar Galactica) had something to do with my game. Tyrol (Battlestar Galactica) said he was "born as a different renegade in 1909 in their [something I can't read, it looks like 'right [or night] train much' city, Oogle".
