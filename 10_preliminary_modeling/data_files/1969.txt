I am in Grandma Agnes' living room. I see a picture of Clyde on the piano, only it's not him. It's an antique picture of a full-bearded man (maybe guy Arthur). His eyes are startling: shiny, silvery and intense. It's spirit world stuff. I look around the room. A light suffuses the room. It is light from the spirit world. I feel a little scared. I hear scary music and feel tension. Nothing happens. Just the light is there. [After I wake up, I decide to meditate on that light, and saw the following images: l. A cobblestone street (rainy like London, very old that goes down and beyond. It sorts of disappears into the light. The feeling of a tunnel. I see then a cloaked figure (at first I think it is death. Maybe it is. Then it seems to be a woman. She goes into the light. 2. I see a door at a corner of a wall. It is only the open door hole, no actual door to open or close. Blackness is beyond. 3. A jail cell door swings open, I swing on it like a garden gate. 4. A face, headband, narrow, small eyes, high up forehead, bulbous nose, small mouth, bad teeth. I wonder if this is my guide. There is "Indianness" about it. I am disappointed at its ugliness, then I try to think of it as "rough hewn."]
