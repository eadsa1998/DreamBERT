I was sitting in the yard at my birth home with classmates and a male physical education teacher. He was handing out report cards. I looked at mine and noticed that I was first in the class for grades for our football segment. I felt that was an extreme accomplishment. Partially because I hate football and partially because I don't know that I have ever been ranked first in my class for anything. Diane S said that she was second in the class. I didn't say anything to my classmates. I ran into the house where Bob F was in the living room watching TV. I showed him my report card. We were all sitting in the yard of my birth home. I was so excited that my hand was shaking as I pointed to the football ranking. He didn't say anything but simply pulled out his report card to show me that he had ranked first in several of his classes. I was very upset by this-that not only could he recognize and appreciate my accomplishment, but that it was just more of the same. Bob F and BJ always doing better at school than I.
