I dreamt that this dream research was being done over at my house, and that all the instruments and everything were over there. By some way every morning when I got up, my mother, my brother-in-law and my sister would all find out what I was dreaming the night before and they'd be ribbing me and kidding me all about it. Every morning they knew just what was going on and what dreams I was having. Dr. Hall was in the dream working the machine in there.
