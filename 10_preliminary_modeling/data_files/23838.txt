I met up with Lynn again, way out in the country, down a bunch of switchbacks, in an old house.  There was the usual running around, nothing getting done, where is he, where are you, meeting up, trying to make things happen and they won't.  But at one point, Lynn and I were in a room, with another older man, and we were talking, and someone came to the window, he was looking in the window, and all of a sudden I felt this really sharp paralyzing pain hit me, as if from an invisible arrow.  And it was from the guy at the window.  I found out the older man in the room had also been hit, he had the exact same reaction I did, which was, you stiffen up, your knees bent, and you kind of half crumble.  The same thing happened to him.  It didn't happen to Lynn, though.  And I either felt resentful that I and the old man were the only ones hit, and Lynn, once again, got off scott-free.  Or I felt like Lynn was part of the scheme and he had ordered it or okayed it.  It was very desolate out there, it was like Utah, kind of sagebrushy and mountainy.  Not mountainy but hills and dirt roads.  And we were hiding out or running away, it was some plot thing, again.  [God, I thought I was done with those.]
