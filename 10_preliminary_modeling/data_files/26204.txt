 I'm on a big cement slab that is out a couple hundred feet from shore in a swimming area. My friend Bubba Hacker and others are there. We're fishing. Bubba is using a bobber and a worm. He casts it out and reels it in. I think that is a bad way to fish: it won't catch many fish. Bubba gets a bite and starts to reel the fish in. It appears that he has snagged a decent-sized northern pike by the dorsal fin! He brings the fish in close and I net it by hanging my arm over the side of the platform. The fish is a big trout or salmon. I net a smaller fish that is floundering on the surface. Huge shark-like fish start surfacing all around the platform. We see their black outlines in the water. They are feeding on the type of fish that I netted. I yell for a man to get some boats so we can get off the slab. Though the slab offers some protection from the sharks, I feel as though I won't be safe for long.
