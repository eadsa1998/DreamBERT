I was at Bev's house and she wasn't there at first. I was there playing with Rachel S and Bob F was there and Mari Kate S. I got into the dishwasher for some reason. There were old cans and the cut off lids and stuff like that in the dishwasher. I almost cut myself on a lid. I thought that was very dangerous and they shouldn't be in there. But I didn't know why they were so I left them. I jar was in there with the lid on and was full of water like they were soaking it to clean it out. I asked Bob F if he had gotten the grad announcement, he said he had. I asked if he liked the invitation and he said he did but didn't seem to enjoy it as much as I thought people would. He said the invitation said the party was at my house. I worried about this to because I thought I had everything right before I sent them out. I asked Mari Kate S if they had theirs yet. She went and got it out of the mailbox and I was getting ready to look at it and double check. Bev was sitting there and had not seen it.
