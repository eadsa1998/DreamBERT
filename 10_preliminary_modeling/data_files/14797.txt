I was watching The Soprano's. Meadow was spying on Tony and the others. She was paranoid and thought that Tony and Carmela knew. Carmela was in the kitchen and told her to stay and eat. Meadow got suspicious and thought they knew and she ran, scared, to the cops and they put photos on the wall and she felt ashamed.
