I saw a name of a horse that was a winner, but I forgot the name now. I parked my car and Ann and I walked about a block away to window shop and when I looked for my car, I couldn't find it. I saw other cars that were old around and a fellow told me that they look that way overnight from the chemicals in the air. There was a man with some kind of new machine. He was going to produce some object out of it. We waited as the machine went into production, and all at once bicycle tires were coming out of it. He said the tires were $8 apiece. I looked and felt one of the tires, but didn't like them for the price, and it was something new which couldn't be relied on.
