 I'm at Washington University. Either my friend Nat Miller or my friend Niles Zelling is there, along with my friend Hilary Nano. I have a wad of chewing tobacco in my mouth. I spit a few times, and take it out. It is disgusting. I have the box of envelopes that are a disguised container for chewing tobacco for my friend Bubba Hacker. Hilary is in a hurry to get back to Brimson.
