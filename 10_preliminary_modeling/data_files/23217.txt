I don't remember why, but I am flying at night, over the tops of buildings in a city strung out in a narrow line, as it would be along a beach.  People on the ground are signaling me to increase my altitude, but I don't know why, because I am higher than the tallest building.  It's a good thing, too, because I don't seem to be able to increase my altitude.  At some point I am concerned that I am getting too far ahead of a group of people who are flying behind me, and I try to make a wide u-turn and go back.  I have to make a very wide turn, but there are power lines off to my left, and I don't want to chance running into them.  At one point I succeed in turning around, but my momentum makes me continue to fly in the same direction as I was going before, only backwards.  When we finally get to our destination, a military man awards some kind of certificate to those who have made the trip, but not to me.  I politely ask if I too might receive a certificate.  At first he says he cannot give me one, but then he goes and talks to someone else and decides he can.
