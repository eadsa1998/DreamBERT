Had a dream of..not sure if it was supposed to be a play.  Something to do with money and inheritance issues, and trying to dispose of a brother and sister or something in order to get it.  We were struggling and swimming and hit a small glacier in the lake, and were trying to work the money away from each other, I think. In the end we were throwing snowy muck and mud muck on one of the people, for a bit it looked like a spider, but we were essentially burying them.
