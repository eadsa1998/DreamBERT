Have you noticed how when I record with this unit in here, it sounds a certain way, but when I go into my studio, the walls, there's less stuff to absorb the sound and so the acoustics are different in there. And in the last entry I used my Mom's boombox because this one was downstairs because I was using it for my Spanish lab stuff. And so it was just different, and I just think it's so cool, the way you can tell immediately, if you know your units, which one you used and where you were when you did it. It's obvious I'm using my Mom's boombox again because my hand-held one's down by the CC TV and I was using it for Spanish. Last night I was dreaming that I had to take all my equipment up to Jackson, not just my mixer and my CD recorder, but my receiver and a DVD player and everything. It was like I was going to be really weighed down. And I think it was because somebody wanted me to do a gig when I got up there or something. And so I was setting things up in the living room on a little table as kind of a test run, and I had the mixer and I had a VCR that I had to connect to it, and I also had my CD recorder, and I also had, I think, a DVD player. And I was trying to figure out how in the heck was I going to connect all three of these things when I already had two sets of RCA inputs, and I could use adaptors for the other one. And I think either my cables weren't long enough or something, but I had to do a little switching around. And then I was nailing down and explaining to Dad what the significance of having a, like a surround sound system is with DVD's and stuff, and then I woke up. That was a very obviously literal dream because we're going to be going here shortly.
