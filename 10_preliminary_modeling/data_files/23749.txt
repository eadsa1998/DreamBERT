Either I or Mom had a baby.  I was there at the birth.  Right after the baby was born, I brought it up and put it on Mom's chest.  It began to sing "Away In A Manger".  It knew all the words.  I leaned very close to the baby to hear it.  It was singing very softly, I could barely make it out.  I was totally amazed that it knew all the words to this song already, right after it was born.  I said to Mom: "Mom, how could this baby know this song already?"  I thought maybe it had heard it through her body.
