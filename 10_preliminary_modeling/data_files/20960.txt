I picked a horse and fooled the outcome. I beat him to something. I was looking for a bottle of whiskey in Toney's stock room. I found it and there was $41.70 on the label. Herman was making some kind of dressing for military funeral in the Far East. I was working in the shop. I went into the hallway and looked up at the ceiling. There was a small round hole with a glass in it. I took a good look and I could see thru it. There was a young fellow with his penis out of his pants, showing it to me. I heard someone say, "Speedy baby, good old speedy baby."
