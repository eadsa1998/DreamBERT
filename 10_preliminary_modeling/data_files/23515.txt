I dreamt that I was with Bill at some house. There were some other old friends involved too. Something about photos of other friends' houses -- and my jealousy of nice houses, especially refinished floors. Bill and I lay on the floor and kissed. I was surprised that he liked me. Jim drove up to the house but didn't find us. Then Bill√ïs brother Dave arrived and hung out wanting for us to go home with him. I got self-conscious. Bill invited me to spend the night on the couch at his (parents') house and we left to go there.
