I'm with some teens and we're in a deserted, scary house. I have a walkie-talkie and find dead and bloody bodies that zoo animals have come in and marauded. A lion runs toward us up the stairs and we run into a room and shut the door. It won't lock, so we all lean against it, fighting the terrible force of the lion clawing through the door. We lock it precariously and I yell, "Is there another door?" We find one and go out into another hall and see a trap door up in the ceiling. We crawl up there and hide. Suddenly I'm aware of spooks and spirits, a huge black-blue tarantula spider and a half eaten away corpse lurking behind us. Trapped between a raging lion and the scary spirits, I call out on my radio, "We're in this deserted house; come get us." Men with rifles come in and kill the lion and we escape. (Fessing up to being where we're not supposed to be was not comfortable, either).
