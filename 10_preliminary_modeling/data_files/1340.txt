I am in a house and decide I want to eat pancakes. I look through the cupboards for the pancake mix but can't find it, so I use round bread and melt butter on it and put apple sauce on it. I look for the syrup but I can't find it. Bonnie is my roommate. I say goodnight to her and start upstairs for bed. I remember I didn't check all the doors and windows to see if they are locked. I feel guilty. I go to each door and window and lock them. I then go upstairs and get in bed. I wake up because "Zippy" the dog is in and banging everything with his enthusiastic tail. I try to figure out why he's there. I hear noises and look out my window. A boy is stealing the car. At first I think it's the first boy that I had found earlier taking things out of the trunk of Bonnie's red car, but this is a different boy (like Anthony). I call him Rizzo. The car is brown, with the windshield broken out and the frame ruined. I worry now that Ellie had snuck out to help the boy, leaving us unprotected by not locking up the house.
