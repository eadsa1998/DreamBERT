I am hanging out by myself, I do not really recall where I am or exactly what I am doing. It seems like what ever I am doing it is very comfortable and normal. It seems like I might be at a really mellow party or barbecue because there are other people mingling about. All I remember is that there is a very pretty girl walking up to me that I do not know. She comes up to me in a very friendly manner and says, "Hi, Tony." I just smile and I do not correct her on calling me the wrong name. She walks away and that is the end.
