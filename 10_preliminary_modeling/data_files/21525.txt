I met Margie S. I took her hand and she loved it. I gave her a kiss and was it sweet. I was taking her into a dark place. We went into a shanty. There was a large building like a barn. I saw a nice spot to lay and be concealed from sight. Just as we got there and she laid down, from all directions fellows came crawling on their fours towards us. They were fellows that worked with me. We walked away embarrassed hand in hand. She said, "You know I don't get it and I feel lazy, no pep. A woman has to have it once in a while."
