I first dreamed that I was going to New York with Sue and Ava. Maria was tagging along. We all went to CVS before we left to get snacks and nail polish. We were driving to the city in this awful stick shift car, and Maria was trying to get us to bake her a cake since it was her birthday. I think we ended up not making it to the city, and instead I had RA training again. But it was summer this time. I was eating breakfast at Heinz, and it was very crowded because all the athletic teams were there. I could hear Mario's voice. All the new RAs had to do a dance as initiation, and I was laughing. I remember seeing Philip and Ainsley and Roberto and Mario. Also Enrique Iglesias was there. There were paintings all over this whole room, really beautiful paintings. I was talking to someone about art and hockey and Les Miserables. I remember being really hot because I was dressed in warm clothes and it was August, and I woke up sweating.
