We were locked in a monastery. Me and Harvey and a lot of other people. The girls had to wear jeanie outfits and do Arab hula dances with crazy leg twists. I decided to leave the monastery during outdoor dancing but Harvey couldn't decided if he wanted to leave or not. He was afraid of the cult leader.
