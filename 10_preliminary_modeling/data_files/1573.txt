I'm in a bus. A policeman is after me. I run away. I go to a gas station and pull out the gas pump from Jerry's little sports car. I hop in and scrunch down so no one can see me and tell him to drive. He drives. I see the bus I was on going down the street upside down on its top. Everyone is upside down.
