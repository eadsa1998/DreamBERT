 Oak Valley Bank has been broken into. The bank is inundated with police and investigators. Two men broke in, and are still inside the bank. They're caught and brought out. One man seems to be dead. One of the men is charred black, with some green or white marks on his body, like a costume. He comes alive, electrifyingly! He's somewhat like Spiderman: elusive, cunning, sneaky, but with a spark, a bite, an electric charge. There is a safebreaker there, picking the lock on the vault with a computer, to get a match.
