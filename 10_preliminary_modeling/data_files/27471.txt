I was at a dance at the W-- Park M-- Hotel. I could hardly take a step without having to stop to exchange "small talk" with some acquaintance. I felt happy to have so many friends and that so many people said hello and wanted me to recognize them. I was busy at the entrance table making out name tags. I danced, but don't remember with whom. The place was very crowded and the people kept milling around. The only color I can remember from the dream is pale green.
