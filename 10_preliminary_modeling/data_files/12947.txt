I was at school. Ms Solomon took a photo of the class for Christmas. She was going to give us a copy the next time she saw us. I wanted it so I could get a photo of Eugene and I was hoping she wouldn't give us a small copy. Alejandro was holding a book. I went to a video shop and I had a quick look for Campfire Tales. Ezra had taken movies out a couple of days earlier. This lady recognized me and the movies I wanted had been taken. There was some Government thing to do with teeth? I was playing some Pokemon type of game. Mom was watching this Little Britain thing and Andy was in an oven. I realized I'd played the game before and I thought it was Pokemon Ranger.
