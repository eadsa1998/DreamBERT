I was at Mom's old house. My room was different and someone put this thing on a tall cupboard I had. They went to bed (my bed, which was just a normal single bed) to sleep. I then tried to jump and get the thing but I couldn't reach and didn't want to stand on my chair incase I fell or broke it. Then someone said they had left poison at the back door (it was Santiago). I looked down the stairs and the front door was open and it was like early morning outside. It was too spooky to go down, so I checked the other doors on the second floor. I told Mom about the poison so I went downstairs and there were huge lumps of meat with a needle and stuff next to it. Simba came and I shooed him away. Ezra and I started to clean it up. I went up the hall and there were Christmas cards. I filled two out to Ezra because we gave one to people the day before as well. Then we needed to hide. Then I was this guy and he went into a room downstairs and it was messy and there were beanbags. He hid under them. Then it was me and the beanbags were quite heavy and I was trying not to breathe loudly so they wouldn't move up and down. The people came in and were talking and then they went quiet. It was a girl and a guy. The girl saw the beanbag and said something and then pulled the beanbags off and then I don't know what happened because I was then watching the end of House of 1000 Corpses. It was zoomed in on Denise's mouth and she was screaming and it zoomed out. It had all been a dream and there was actually another hour or so and the whole movie went for three hours. I was thinking that I'd forgotten about that.
