I dreamed I was in an operating room where I had just had a baby, but I didn't feel any pain. They made me get dressed and I went out with my sister. We got to the elevator and there my sister met a boy who took us shopping, but before that, in the hospital we went to visit a lady who had also had a baby and was in a room with all her relatives. When we went shopping, the boy got off with my sister to buy bread and when he returned to the car, he greeted a friend of mine (M) who died last year. We met my aunts and they told my sister to take me to the hospital, because it might be harmful for me to be around. Before that I asked the boy to take me to a bookstore to buy a pen for a girlfriend. The salesman showed me how the pen worked in the store. I bought it and asked to have it gift-wrapped.
