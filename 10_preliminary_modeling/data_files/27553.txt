In my dream, I tuned in on the W-- R-- R--. I heard the subject announced and it was something like: The effect of the atom bomb on the communistic social organization of the ant. Then I heard what I thought was Dr. S--'s voice saying: "It will make the red ants white." Then Dean D--'s voice said. "They should be blue, like the blue bloods of the Eastern campuses." Then Dr. B-- said, "It does not make any difference what color they are, as long as they have good healthy organisms!" I did not see any of these people in my dream. I saw the living room of my home. I was in the living room alone.
