I am in a house with several bedrooms.  It is dark, and I am not asleep.  It seems to be Uncle Jack's house.  I think Joe is sleeping in one of the beds in one bedroom, and in the other is a baby of about 3-4 months, with a light illuminating its face.  It looks very angelic, and I go over and kiss it.
