I boarded a bus coming from Akron back into Cuyahoga Falls. Sitting in the last seat on the right hand side was a girl with the looks and body and reputation to start pleasant thoughts. I sat down beside her and started a conversation. What was said seemed unimportant for our mouths moved, but I heard nothing. I began to feel her leg. She didn't resist. I asked for her phone number, which she gave me. This seemed foolish for I can still remember her phone number. By the time I had gone far enough with her to know that we both had the same desires, and that she was willing in any case, my bus stop came. I told her I could call her that night. I got off the bus and the dream ended.
