I had entered, or had someone enter a bunch of contacts in a database that we had sent the BCB book to either because they had purchased it or because we had given it to them. I'm not sure which. It was because of a specific campaign however. I was going through the listing and realized that they way they had been entered did not make it clear which campaign they were related to and we would have difficulty pulling up a report of these people for follow-up or for the next step of the campaign. I figured out a quick and easy fix, something that could be accomplished in just a few minutes, and began to make the fix.
