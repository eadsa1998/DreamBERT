I saw a man walking on a road dressed in dungarees. I wanted to get a job with them. I had just gotten some kind of job. I was getting dressed. I felt something inside my sex organ, and I cut it open and took it out. I wondered how I would sew it on. I wondered whether the doctor could do so. And I was worried about not going to work.
