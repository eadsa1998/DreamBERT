I went to visit Sue in Massachusetts (someone I met online).  At first it seemed she lived in a normal middle-class home, with an upstairs.  We talked and it was good to see her, I asked her all the questions I could think of to make conversation, conscientious because it was our first visit.  I think I met her children, or we talked about them, for instance, I asked why didn't she name them Ernest and Mariel.  But then later it became apparent that she lived in an incredibly wealthy house.  I was down a hall, by myself, I looked up, and realized the hall was long and ornately decorated, white and gold, and around the corner there was an actual ballroom.  This was a surprise to me, because it was different than my first impression, and also I thought: was I just not paying attention, or did it change, or do I know Sue that little?  There was to be a party that night, the preparations were tremendous, I watched, Sue seemed gone, but I watched the house and ballroom being made ready.  I pointed out to Mom how wealthy this house was.  There was one of those cast iron benches there.  I felt a little forgotten by Sue, like she had more important things to do.  Then I was at the other end of the ballroom.  And it was really an ice-skating rink, right in the house.  The guests began skating elegantly.  I was really amazed at this.
