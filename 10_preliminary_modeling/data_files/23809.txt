Next dream:  I saw a scene of a hippie family.  They had a child, and they treated their little girl the way I would have wanted to treat kids, back when I wanted them - with respect for her, real unconditional love and support, attention to the child's being.  The little girl was sitting in a window of a stone tunnel, like the tunnel at Zion N. P. that has a window overlooking the canyon.  Her Dad, Mom and family was there.  The Dad was listening to her.  Then there was a shot of Viktoras Kulvinskas' face (vegetarian food writer), a feeling of that hippie life.  He was showing sprouts or fruit or something, how it enhanced the quality of your life.  And I knew then that it was not really possible, that life I had once wanted, that it wouldn't really work like that.  I was sad about this.  I felt like maybe that kind of life was possible for some in Moab, but not possible for me.  I felt how truly and drastically far I had gone from that life.
