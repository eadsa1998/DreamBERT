I dreamt I was in Japan with these other people. We were having chips. They were all laying out on the table. The dad got mad and threw away my bag, thinking it was nobody's. The people barely noticed me. Setting: In a restaurant that was similar to MacDonald's. Characters: Me, three unknown kids, a dad and a mom, and a waiter. Feelings and Thoughts: Confused. It didn't make sense at all. It was just a jumbled mess of my imagination.
