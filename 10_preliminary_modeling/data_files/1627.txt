I am shopping in Payless looking for a piece of furry material I can have to touch. I find a few things but they aren't soft enough. I find purses with pockets and they look pretty, but they won't do. Then I notice that the merchandize section of Payless is very small. The rest of the space is filled with tables and chairs like in a restaurant and in the back is an aerobics class.
