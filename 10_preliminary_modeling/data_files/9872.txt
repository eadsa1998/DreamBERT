Eric Scott with us on a car ride to buy special apples. We hold hands; he holds my breast under my sweater; I feel very happy and close to him. I say I love you, and he seems to reciprocate. I find "instructions" he has written; also a note saying it is all nonsense, that he does not love. He leaves us to go on to his birthday party; feel sad.
