As you can see, I'm kind of starting this tape off on a really bad foot because my singing voice is absolutely out of commission, and I was supposed to have a thing tonight, but I decided I wouldn't be able to go because it's not like my voice couldn't do it, but my physical strength is like gone. So I'm glad it wasn't any kind of a big audition or anything I had to do. I just hope that tomorrow is a big Christmas surprise for Mom and Dad and I hope I won't have to disappoint the people I've invited. I just have to; there's no way I can back out of tomorrow. Tonight is one thing, but not tomorrow. Anyway, to the point, this is right before Christmas. This happened to me last year. I had a dream last night that, well, I dreamt that I had to get up and go take my exam early in the morning, which I did that day. And I dreamt that I had some last minute audio editing to do on DP, and so I sat down and, first of all, the colors on the contrast were like all messed up and I like opened up one of those set up pages, you know how they go. I was having Mom read things off to me and I wasn't making sense of it, and I was getting more and more confused and I kept losing the cursor, as I often do. And I finally said, "Okay, I'm shutting down and I'm getting out of here." So I closed it down and set it down, and next thing I know, I'm at school and Mom's a little late and I'm racing to get to Mr. Perry's class on time because I dreamt that it was his exam I had to take. And what the material of his exam was going to consist of was reacting appropriately to a fire drill. And we were racing to get to his class before the alarm class, and we didn't make it. It went off while we were in the hall, and, you know, sound, acoustics-wise, the hall is the worst place you could be when the fire alarm goes off. Then I don't remember too much more, and then I woke up.
