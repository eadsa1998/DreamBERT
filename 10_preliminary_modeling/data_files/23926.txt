I was travelling to some sort of BBQ. I had a Winnebago and brought some food with me. The BBQ was in Boston. Along the way I met Jahn and Jim and some other people. We had fun travelling along and sleeping on the side of the road. In a town called "Kamikaze" We drove by Walter and Shirley and one of her girlfriends. I think Walter plucked all the silks from the corns I had brought for the BBQ. Jahn brought a lots of things for a salad. He wouldn't let us listen to reggae music. <br/
