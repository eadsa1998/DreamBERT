I was at 'school'. Calvin and I were answering questions about Samantha. Evelyn was in a wheelchair. Calvin wrote that Samantha was born in September. We went on IMDb and two other sites to help. There was something about Tiana and some Paul person. She had this thing and they were going to get $100. Tiana didn't believe that I knew Dmitri. She confronted him and he said that he knew me. He walked into the girls toilets.
