I was out of work and broke. I ended up taking a job at a deli which was frequented by TMM people in the morning. I was humiliated doing this. Derek worked there and was the one showing me how to do things although he wasn't that big of a help. A TMM person came in and ordered some black bean salad but ordered it by some special name so I didn't know what it was. On my second day, I didn't show up for work - I quit. Instead I walked by The Bank Cafe and looked inside the window and saw Jamie sitting at some slot machines. I went in and sat at the bar until she left. I had some quarters and put them in the machine. I had to replace some of them though because I noticed that some of the quarters were very old - like from the 1800's. On my first go, I get 5 lemons all the way across. The machine rings and out comes $500 worth of quarters. Holy Shit! Yahoo. I really needed that. Since I have so many quarters I throw some more in. Ring. Ring. Another $200 bucks. I test my luck some more but that's all there is, but I am psyched anyway.
