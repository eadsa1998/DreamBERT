I was in my former home, and my father was telling me things about my mother. My mother was also in the house and heard what my father was saying. My father seemed to be trying to turn me against my mother. For a while, I was believing him, and I felt that my mother had done something wrong. Then for some reason, I changed my mind, and I began to dislike my father. I am sure that there was some good reason in the dream for my changing my mind, but I can't remember it. After this, I began to think of my mother's weak heart and how she might die. This was accompanied by a very sad, sympathetic, loving attitude toward my mother. Then I went into my mother's bedroom and noticed the sheets and the pillow were dirty; that is, they were uniformly dark. A sheet would have to be very dirty to be this color. Then I thought what a pity that my poor mother has to sleep in a bed like that, and I had the same feeling described above.
