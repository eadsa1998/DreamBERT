I was at the computer and I was going through an online archive of an author's online newsletters. As I was going through them I saw one that. these newsletters were laid out so there was a header across the full width of the top. Then there were two columns. The left-hand column was a bit narrower than the right, but not much. It was a very dark background. It was a color, maybe navy. The font was white. The text in the right column at times cut off. You had to click on it to read the full text. I saw one that looked to me like it was DOP, which Bill C wrote. I didn't click on it for sure. I just immediately assumed that's what it was. Because of the date of it I knew it had been written before Bill C wrote DOP. I immediately got upset about that and distrusted Bill C and started thinking that all of his content is just a rewrite of someone else's stuff. I started thinking all these bad things about Bill C. It almost seems the title of the one that I saw on this other author's newsletter was The Death of Reason.
