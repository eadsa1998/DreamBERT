Jake and I are in his "car," a flat, large platform on small wheels. I say this is a California car. It's nice and fun, but wouldn't be too safe if we crashed. I now am with some women and I'm trying to write down a dream I had, in detail, and someone wants me to tell them the dream. I say I have to write this down first before it's all gone! It's fading fast even as I try to repeat the details in my mind to keep them there. I write fast. [BL]
