 My aunt and uncle and cousins, the Redding family, give my three siblings and I Easter baskets. There is a basket for each of us and another treat. My brother Wally gets Jolly Ranchers. I get a gummi-like candy. My uncle Rusty has molds that he uses to make the candy. He uses Jell-O with bits of gelatin and puts them in the oven.
