I went to Centrelink or something with Mom. It was a HUGE building. It was very confusing to get around. Mom went off somewhere. There was a computer section and a lot of people were on them. I had to climb over some at the end and ended up on this path which was covered in old water bottles and mess from Ezra. I walked down and found the room I was supposed to go to and waited outside. A few seconds later my name was called out. I realized I'd forgotten to bring ID and I said to the lady that I'd be right back. I ran out and ran across the carpark to the car and then realized I didn't have keys. I ran back and went into the room with them. I sat down at the desk and apologized. Mary Lynn Rajskub was one of them. The first question they asked was about how her character (Chloe) from 24 affected me. I said something like she was a good character and was a good role model (I put together quite an eloquent little speech). They looked quite happy with it. At the end of the interview or whatever it was, they said I could bring in the ID later. I was thinking that I didn't want to try and get around this place again. Mary Lynn Rajskub then remembered that last week (or some recent time) I had met her and had a photo taken. She had a copy of the photo, and I had almost been cut out of it (some random had taken the photo). She said I could use that. There was now a new shortcut to leave the place. The path that had been messy was now clear, but had lots of ants and cockroaches. I had to walk through it and climb over the computers again to find Mom. I told Mom that you could now just 'click on the place on the map' and you could instantly teleport there. We left through the shortcut. Later, we were going for a drive and Ezra was coming. Mom told me to sit in the back so he could sit in the front and I said no and sat in the front.
