The setting was the pool room at the student union. Three girls, all of whom attend the same church as I here in Miami and whom I know well, were starting to sit down at one of the pool tables as if it was a table. What was unusual was that it was covered on top like a table. They were carrying trays of food and were planning to eat there. I saw them and walked over and suggested that we go into the cafeteria and eat so that the boys who were playing on the other tables could use that one also. They got up and the four of us walked into the cafeteria. (These girls attend Coral Gables High School.) [Enjoying the situation, pleasant, no color]
