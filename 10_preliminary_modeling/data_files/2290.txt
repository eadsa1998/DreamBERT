A good-looking man likes me. I decide it's time to do my cleansing ritual. He suggests I do it in the fireplace in the living room with the 25 people seated at the tables watching. I laugh and say, "No way. The space is too small and all those people watching." I imagine they would all politely clap their hands after I accomplished my task, saying in cool, clipped accents, "That's nice B." The guy and I laugh at the silliness of their British audience routine. I say, "I'll do it in the swimming pool." Hasani says, "It's too cold." I say, "I only have to do it for three minutes. Maybe you could run some hot water into the corner I'll be in." She agrees. The man looks at my black swim suit-encased figure admiringly. [BL]
