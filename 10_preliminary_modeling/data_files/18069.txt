I was with my cousin Juanita and we saw some puppies that they didn't have any owners or anything and I held one and I put it back. I was thinking about getting it and I was a real tiny one. I loved Mike and I didn't love him anymore. And then we didn't really go camping. We stayed on the floor with rocks and slept. I had a pet chipmunk and he kept eating too many berries in the trees, but in our backyard there was this horrible black four-legged something. I ran into the house with my chipmunk.
