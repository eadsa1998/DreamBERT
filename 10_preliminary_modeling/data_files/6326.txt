This dream was one of the best ones I've ever had. I dreamt that I was able to fly. Not just fly in the sky, but in space. This dream did a lot of skipping around on me: as if I were changing channels, so a lot of it doesn't make sense. I do know one thing for certain -- that I was able to fly to the end of the universe. At the end there was nothing but a white and black light.
