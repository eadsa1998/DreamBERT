I ended up in the future in a game, except it was playing out live. We landed in a spacecraft which was then a car and we closed the doors they locked. This meant we were stuck here. We had no weapons. This guy had a gun and we were trying to hide from him. We went into a building. There were Asian people and they tried to talk to us, and I think trying to help us. Instead of hiding we decided to fight. This other person got a gun and I hid. Then we were in a shop and I ran out as the guy came. There was glass around the corner and I knocked the guy off and took his gun. People were coming across the lawn and we were shooting and I kept missing and someone called it "target practice". Then there were hairy monkey things outside and I said they were "what Austin evolved into over 100 years". There was a train station which allowed you to teleport to places. There was also a fast ride which was really fun. You had to control it for a while at some point and jump over obstacles and get coins. I got game over at one point.
