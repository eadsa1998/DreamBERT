I see Dr. Fleischman and Magi from Northern Exposure gently arguing like they do. There is a school dance, like end of year dance, in the gym and Dr. F is laying out small round spots that alternate indent, outhunt, and he wants to make sure no one accidentally steps on them, because if they do, the energy or electricity is spent or injured. He nearly steps on a couple himself. There are two rows, one at each end of the gym.
