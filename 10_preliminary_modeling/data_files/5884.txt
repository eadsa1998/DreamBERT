Am in a bed outdoors in a garden and the bed is at the corner where two eight-foot wide paths meet at a right angle. Before going to sleep I see some flowers alongside one of the paths and realize how pleasant it will be to see these again when I awaken. Then realize winter is coming and they will be gone. Awaken on a sunny morning and find I am wearing a black corsolette and I immediately start to unclasp it since it is clasped all the way down the front. I do this as I am lying on top of the bed and without blankets. Then see a girl strolling along quietly sniffing flowers. I quickly pull my knees up and close to stomach so she won't see what I am wearing. She passes and says, "Good Morning." I respond and she disappears down the other path. I relax and start again to unclasp when someone, a stranger, comes strolling from other direction. And I hear footsteps from the direction the girl came. Realize with all these people I'll never be able to get the corsolette off and out of bed.
