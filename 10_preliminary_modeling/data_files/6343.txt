I saw myself being the MVP in my softball league in my dream. Also I was given the Most Improved Player award and also being voted to the Allstar team. I was told that everybody who was on my team was so surprised that they never thought that I could turn my performance around so quickly. I was hitting homeruns like it was nothing and also making catches that I only could make and no one else. Every time I would show up at the ball park, people would start to talk and I could hear the positive remarks that were being said about me. I ended up making a diving catch in the championship game. When I woke up to go to the bathroom the next day, I looked in the mirror and wondered, some day I wish the dream never ended.
