I was married and we were having the reception. I had a great dress and my family was there. I was expecting great food and they were serving sandwiches. I finally told my husband that we needed to sit down together to eat. We sat down and he still wasn't paying attention to me. I felt lonely and went to find my mother. She comforted me.
