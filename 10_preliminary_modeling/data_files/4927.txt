["Hurt client and friendly Howard."] I am in a classroom. A man is teaching philosophy. His desk is one school desk standing on top of another school desk. Piled on top of that is lots of books. It is all precarious and unstable. I am his assistant. A woman student is having problems. I counsel her trying to be supportive and helpful. I work as a counselor in the classroom. Now I am home and in bed, the woman client is in bed with me. She has an injured disabled foot. I am still counseling her. Howard comes in. I explain to him this is my client. He nods at her foot. I say yes, she has a hurt foot. He seems friendly and supportive.
