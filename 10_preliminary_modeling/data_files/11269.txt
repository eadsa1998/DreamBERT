I was walking down Euclid Ave. There was a dog closely resembling the dog I mentioned in a previous dream (Brownie). Yet I realized in the dream that Brownie was dead, and that this wasn't the same dog. This dog was lying on his stomach, and when I first approached him, he may have snarled or at least he looked mean or unfriendly. As I began to pet him, he turned over on his side and his back as dogs often will do. Even while I was petting him, I felt that I couldn't trust him completely, and that he might bite me. The dog seemed to enjoy my petting and scratching him. Though I felt he might bite me, the fear of being bitten was very small, but there was a fear. I had a candy bar in my pocket, and as I rose to leave I felt that the dog wanted this candy bar (a Baby Ruth). However, I didn't want to give the dog this candy bar, and then I told him that he couldn't have it. I then left and proceeded west down Euclid Ave. on my way I believe to a typing class which I am now taking at John Hay three nights a week.
