I was in a carpark. Dad was with mafia kind of people. They were taking my car somewhere and they gave me this other car in the meantime, but there wasn't much space between cars and it was squishy to get in. Then we were at Midvale shops. I parked at the side of the road and checked the map book. I told people to go. I was then with characters from Friends. I was dating Chandler and Rachel was dating Ross. Monica was with someone too. Rachel, Monica, Chandler, Joey, Ross and I went shopping. Rachel and Monica bought lots of clothes for their boyfriends. I kept leaving my wallet in random places. We were in the sleepwear section and Monica and Rachel were like 'oh we should buy the guys pyjamas' but the guys weren't interested. The pyjamas were folded on shelves and I touched one of them. It was soft and slightly silky and unlike anything I'd ever touched before and I called them over. The guys touched it and wanted one each. The girls ended up choosing this other one which was just as soft. Then they were shoes and they had pink and I chose blue. The pink one also had green and were very child-like.
