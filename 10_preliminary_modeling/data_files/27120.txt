In this dream my husband and I (I did not see my husband during the dream, yet I knew he was there) were going out with several other couples. I do not remember exactly what took place but I recall that we wished to go to some place of entertainment very badly, but we had no means of getting there. I remember seeing some woman with a grey P-- lamb coat there and I remember walking down the street wlth these people. She held my hand and led the way for me. Someone suggested we go to a large garage where he knew we could get a car, but he gave the impression that he would have to go thru a lot of red tape to get it. At the garage, everyone seemed very secrative. We got into the car and I knew we felt guilty because it was something we were not supposed to do. As we drove away, I saw some man watching us from a window. I ducked my head down so he would not see me cause I felt we were stealing the car and would get caught. But the driver said he knew the man then we drove away very fast.
