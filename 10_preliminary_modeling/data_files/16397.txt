I was like a b___ enrollment student doing Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays at Westport High School, and only being excused for the time I had to go to the college. And I had a test that I had to take in Psychology at the college, but the test was given to the office of Westport High School for some reason and I had to go by Ms. Teddy's office and get it. And I had to do a couple other things that I can't remember, but I want to know why I keep dreaming about being back in Mr. Jameson's class. It was boring, so I really don't want to be back there, but I guess I keep thinking like I am. And I dreamt that I was in Mr. Jameson's class and we were lifting weights and listening to his boombox, and I had to get out of class and go take my test, but I was kind of chicken and didn't know how to ask him and he wasn't even around. And so I had the notion that I'd better just leave and go take my test. And then I woke up.
