["Reaching for the goal."] I am with the community college Counselors again. Chuck is preparing to begin a game called "Reach For A Goal." He has decided to go on a river run and fishing expedition. He is explaining this game is very useful. It teaches people how to succeed and stretch their boundaries. He asks who will hold his wallet and money for him while he goes. No one volunteers, so I say I will. He hands it to me. I see a black wallet like mine stuffed with one hundred dollar bills. I feel some responsibility to keep them safe. Then as Chuck is talking, I see his head on the ground, like he is buried to his neck in the ground or his head is simply off his body. Dylan sitting on my right says that game is similar to the one I'm playing called Build An Acquisition. He says he bought an orchard and now will create a crop and till the soil and make it work well. Both these games sound very good to me. I walk back into the building and call Bonnie on the phone in the hall. She is a department head and I tell her about these games. She too can benefit. I am aware Dylan is near by and I hope he hears me and approves.
