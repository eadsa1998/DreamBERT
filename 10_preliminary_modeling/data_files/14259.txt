I was at Mom's. My room was different. I saw this squirrel like animal run behind my desk. When I left a while later, Darren asked if I'd seen the squirrel and I said "I thought it was a squirrel" but that I thought I'd imagined it. They said they needed to get it. It was just a mouse looking thing. It bit my hand, which stung and Mom put some cream on it. Mom also asked me at one point if I'd worn a pad at all during my last period because "there was blood on everything". I was walking to the car and I passed Eugene and I put my hand out and our fingers touched. We were then both sitting in the back of a car and I can't remember where the drivers were going. Then I was with Mom and Ezra. Leslie lived next door to this person Mom went to see. She was holding her baby and it had a dirty face. I spat on my hand and was cleaning its face, while I was holding it. I handed it back, noticing that it was pretty heavy and almost fell back. We drove back in there at a later time, and there were shoes making up the line in the middle of the road. I was then reading a book or watching a movie and in it, this guy went into this warehouse like building (it was shed-like, but big). It had a roller door. He was looking for this guy. The guy was in there and he followed him through this tunnel underground. Then it was a game and I had to pick four out of quite a few options about what I wanted him to do (and in turn, what I thought would make the most interesting reading experience). The guy's thoughts were in the book and he was thinking that it had now been 18 months under there. The bad guy decided to get it over with and confronted him -- he was a demon looking thing [Clive Barker style].
