I dreamt that the second semester had started at the university and also a strike protesting the new Industrial Law. Two groups were forming, the leaders of each side shouted all at the same time. The dean immutably observed everything from a window. A group went out on the street shouting, "Down with the government." The police came, everyone ran, the police threw bombs and at that point my dream ended.
