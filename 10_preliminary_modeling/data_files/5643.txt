[1997-06-21] I was sent back to college to go to this course work for rehabilitation counselors/teachers. Since I already had my teaching certificate, I was sent back to get it renewed. I was in this big classroom at Boston College where I had never really been. It was a typical room with the chairs with the little half desks. I was taking a test so I could be except from some of the course work and saying to myself, "Gosh, I'm really almost too old to be going back to school again, why am I doing this?"
