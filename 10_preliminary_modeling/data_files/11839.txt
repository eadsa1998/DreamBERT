There was some The Young Ones thing but all I can remember is Mike getting into this "bed" which was like a hammock and it was up against a wall and the others got in too. Then I was at this snowy "Runescape" place and Ezra went missing and we all wore scarves, but I got a really small one. I ended up with Ezra and we were by ourselves. We walked into this dark room and it was really freaky. Then we were at this place with a big playground and there were lots of kids.
