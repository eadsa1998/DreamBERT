I was at the Technical College, though it was a bit different. The top floor of the media building was this huge area where people would gather for like 'parties' and drinking. Cecelia was there. I took the elevator down to the bottom floor, which was still the same and I started walking towards the storeroom when I saw Fletcher walking my way. He stopped as if he was waiting for me, but I looked up at him and then looked back down as if I were ignoring him and he started walking back the other way. I went back up the elevator when I was done there and went back down with Cecelia some time later. Fletcher was sitting, waiting at the elevator and he got on and Cecelia was talking to him. She made some joke to me about something and I responded and said something to Fletcher as well.
