I work in a big city - the capital city I guess - in a large open-plan office building. I'm contracted to work 4 1/2 days a week. My line manager, who discusses my contract with me, is Larry, a colleague/client at work in waking life. The job seems boring even before I've started, but there's a recession on, so I have to take it. I ask if I could do just 3 days a week. He says "No, you have to do the 4 1/2". "OK" I say, "No problem, see you Monday". I leave the building with 2 colleagues (colleagues from old jobs in waking life). We walked down flights of steps in what seems like a concrete carpark - scruffy, dirty. The whole city feels like this - over crowded and crumbling. I have to find the train station. Now I'm speaking to my brother on my cell phone. He says he'll help me locate the station. It seems much more complicated that it ought to be.
