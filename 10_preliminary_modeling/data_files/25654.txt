 I'm in the basement of a house watching television. A husband to the family living in the home comes home. He says something about how he hasn't seen me in a long time. He knows me, but is upstairs and doesn't know I am here. His daughter and son are there. They come down to the basement. I talk with them. The man is like my friend's father Charles Kramer. I see some photographs of them and their house. I have two small stuffed dogs. One is white and the other is pink. The white dog is older. When I see the man he doesn't seem very happy to see me. He may not recognize me.
