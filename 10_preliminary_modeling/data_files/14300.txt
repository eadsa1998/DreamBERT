I was at school which was different. I was with Ramona. I was showing her my escape plan for wagging so you don't get caught. There were people around everywhere and there was a beach nearby. There was a platform on the beach where a statue used to be and I said "I stood on there yesterday". I was showing her how to dodge teachers, as they walked around in the same pattern. Ms Pendleton was there. I got to the end building and the door slammed shut. Then I was watching something like Dead Set. It had the UK Big Brother and Craig Charles was on it, except he was 'Irish'. I was telling Mom that on Red Dwarf, Rimmer had been on Big Brother. Then zombies came. There was a family and there was a brother and a sister who were teenagers and they could blow hard, which would knock the zombies to the wall. Their younger sibling came in. Then Mom and I went to her friend's house. It was in a fancy area and he was swimming in a big pool. There was a sign advertising a party at some other guy's house sometime. Hold on Loosely was on the radio.
