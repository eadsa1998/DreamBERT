I was in a locker room adjoining the swimming pool. Two girls and myself were getting ready to go in. We got white swimming caps to put on. Mine had a brim like a baby's bonnet. I was having some difficulty stuffing my long hair into it. We were late for our class. We decided to play hookey. The men's class came back into the locker room. There was something about auditioning in a play. Then I put on a beautiful white dress. It was an old-fashioned wedding dress. I thought, "It's beautiful." I looked in mirror. It was a trick mirror. I looked squashed, out of proportion. The lace work on the dress was lovely. I looked at the back of the dress. I saw a beautiful, lacy bustle. It was laying across a stuffed animal's tail. I was sitting on a large, stuffed, duck billed platypus. The yellow cloth bill was in front and the other girl (who had made the bustle and had so informed me when I exclaimed about its existence with, "Well, I know that, I made it"), and I are playing puppets. We laughed. It was time to take the dress off and give it back. I was going to be an actress.
