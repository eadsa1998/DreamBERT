["Auditioning for what?"] A man and I are in a house. It is his family's house. We are going ti an audition, I gather up papers. I am trying to learn how to run the business. I walk into an auditorium. I see some people already seated in the front seats. I start to join them. Then I sit at tables in the back. I am organizing my things I brought. A male teacher is asking me questions. I am distracted. Lucy is there, singing in my ear. Now my man and I lie on a bed trying to get comfortable. We are going to audition together. Then we are called back to his family's house. I look for my room and see I am sharing it with 2 other women. Like a dorm room.. I see 2 bunks and a third one on top. I notice I am expected to use the top bunk. I point out that I am disabled and must be accommodated. The woman says we're all disabled here. And shrugs. I relook at the bunk and start trying to use it. I am annoyed, but also agree that it might have to be.
