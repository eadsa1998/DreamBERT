I was at work. Terry Jones was there and I know the other Monty Python guys were there, but I only remember Terry. He kept making faces. Anyway, work finished and I had to go to this 'buddy' place. I was buddies with this little girl with a strange voice. The buddy place was full of orphans, I think. Anyway, this little girl really liked me. She hadn't been there for a while, but she was there this time and she started climbing all over me. This other girl there, an older one, like me (she wasn't one of the orphans) had a video camera and she asked me to record some stuff. It only had 20 minutes of space on it. Later, I was looking up Monty Python stuff on the net and I found pictures of Michael Palin when he was younger.
