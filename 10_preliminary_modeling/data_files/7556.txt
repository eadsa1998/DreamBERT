My brother Harry and his wife Barbara, Mary and I are supposed to go on a short pleasure trip. We are all together in this place when Harry gets on the phone. His conversation goes on and on and takes up a great deal of time. I am impatient to get going and wonder how long Harry is going to keep talking on the phone. Then I realize I can't find Mary and ask Barbara where she is. Barbara tells me the trip is cancelled because Mary isn't feeling well. I start searching for Mary, going from room to room, looking for her. The dwelling was poorly lit. I didn't see Mary, but knew she was there.
