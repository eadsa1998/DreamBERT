I'm supposed to pick Sharon up after some event - a meeting at Park Presbyterian, I believe - and take her home.  It is to be over at about 10 p.m.  I get started late and I'm getting worried.  I drive out Longhorse Boulevard to the lake, and when I get there I can't remember which way to go to get to Grafton.  I go a ways to the right and come back because it doesn't look like the right way.  By this time, it's about 11 p.m., and I'm really worried.  I come to some swimming pool within a small brick building surrounded by trees.  On the inside, it looks like the pool at Lake Rexorama Lodge.  Doug and I are sharing a basket, and he has the tag.  I have to get out and leave for something, so I have to find him and get the tag.  He is climbing out of the pool right in front of me. I see Sharon later, and evidently she got home alright and isn't mad.
