Last night I had a dream that we were still in Italy on some secret boat chase. We docked in Rome and I got together with 30 other people my age, which I sort of knew, but not that well. Then we got home and had to go to school. I realized I was naked when I got to school, so I tired to stay behind and get dressed, but wasn't embarrassed at all. While I was trying to get into my pink corduroys and a white polo shirt, I thought of all the ways I could try to get Lou's attention. There was a puppy that was trying to attack me while I was getting dressed. Finally, we left the chapel and went outside where everyone was singing hymns. My mother had to call my father to discuss dinner plans, since I had a hockey game. I went to lunch and sat with Olivia. I noticed Andrea at the table next to Lou at a nearby table, so I rushed at Andrea screaming, and Lou noticed and Andrea got mad. Then I saw Valerie and Ashley.
