The characters were not all that human. There was something to do with looking at the stars. One of the choir members was getting married, and I had a fight with one of the other characters. We dressed the woman up for marriage, but in doing so she was pretty much just a Puffkin. A little cloak and hat. At someone's word, I was trying to splice videotape. The character with whom I'd had the falling out forgave me. An incredibly tall man, who somewhat resembled my father, lovingly picked me up and carried me to my room, past a large gathering.
