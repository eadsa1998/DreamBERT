I dreamt I was at the university (which is a girls' school) and there was some kind of game going on. I don't know whether it was football or volleyball. Naturally, after the game there were boys and girls, and one of the boys grabbed some girl and said, "This is ..." and he said a name and even an address and telephone number. Then I was someplace with a lady and she pointed to a dog and told me that this was a domestic animal, and then she would say that this animal was from the mountains and so on. She kept classifying them according to what she thought. This happened at my university and I was alone, although there were some girls that I knew. The boys and girls were of approximately my same age, that is between 18 and 20 years. This dream is indifferent. I neither dislike it nor like it.
