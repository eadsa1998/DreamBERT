 I'm walking through a shopping mall looking for a waffle house. There are many breakfast food shops. I walk by a bunch of places that are open for business and are well lighted. I enter an area that is darker and deserted, the lights are off. There is a lot of food left sitting out on a table, with plates. It appears that people, including employees, just got up and left. It's late morning/early afternoon. These places must only be open for breakfast or brunch, I think. I see a deserted fancy restaurant, with some donuts left sitting out. I creep over in the dimly lit room and take a donut with red filling. I then creep over towards a piano that is near a wall, out of view from the restaurant entrance, just in case someone comes along. I sit down on a chair next to the piano and start eating the stolen donut. An alarm above my head goes off a few seconds after I sit down. It blares loudly. I get up and run away. I slip and slide, having no good traction. A man sees me running. I realize he knows it is I that is the culprit because I'm running. I try to change his mind by talking to him. I say, "Excuse me..." but I slur my speech and am in such a frenzy I can't talk, and I run away. The man runs to alert police about me. At some point I hear a Deep Breakfast song.
