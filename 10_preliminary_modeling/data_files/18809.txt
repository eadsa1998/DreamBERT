I cannot remember the beginning of this dream, but in the first part I can recall I was back in the country in Michigan talking with two girls. One was unattractive and the other was fairly nice looking. I began to get friendly with this one, but not too enthusiastically. She took my display of affection to mean more than I had intended and started trying to get me aroused by pushing her breasts into me. At this point the thought came to my mind that her mother had taught her to do this to enable her to get a boy to marry her. However, I wasn't too concerned with this as I was rather enjoying her. Then we stopped because another girl, a very cute one, came on the scene. I liked her at once and knew that she was a girl I could love. I went over and talked with her for a while and soon was kissing her as the other two girls and the mother looked on sadly. She was great and I remember I wished I could have dreamed more about her or remembered more about her when I woke up.
