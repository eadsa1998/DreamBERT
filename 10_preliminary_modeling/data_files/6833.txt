At a picnic dinner. I am eating steak. There is a salad of green string beans. In lettuce leaves. A domineering woman tells me to eat my vegetable. I tell her I am going to when I finish the meat. Then I pick up a side dish and ask if this is the desert. It's 2 _ inch cubes of fruit. I remark on its smallness. The woman doesn't like it, says I shouldn't criticize, "but take mine." I protest but she insists and passes her dish of two large stewed dried peaches.
