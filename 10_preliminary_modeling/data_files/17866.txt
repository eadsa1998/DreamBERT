I was in a boat race.  Going around the track I went through a housing area.  Part of the track was curvy and I was going too fast- my boat scraped the railing.  I wanted to stop at a Wendy's in the next town.  I stopped where I thought it was, and it was a restaurant, but I didn't see any Wendy's signs.  I walked towards the back where the bathrooms were to check the other side.  A woman approached me and asked if I wanted anything.  I asked for water, but she said they didn't have any.  So I asked what had the most water in it and she said tea.  She started to leave to get me some and I told her I didn't have any money.  She said that was alright, vote for us and you can have it.  I was leery, not being a resident of their state or anything.  But I sat down and read about their governor.  I think his name was Garfield something.  A while later came the end of the race.  We were on horses now, not boats.  There were about four of us coming in at once.  After crossing the finish line, we all ran towards our waiting families.  Some got held up in the crowds so just ended up hugging opponent's families first.  Then we were gathered together to 'replay' the start of the race for pictures.  It seemed like the horses were being catapulted forward.
