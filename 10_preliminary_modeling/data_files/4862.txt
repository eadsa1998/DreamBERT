["Helping George Harrison."] George Harrison and I are in his apartment. A group of people are there also. He is interviewing them to find people who will help him build up his fame again. He seems accepting and satisfied with their answers but I am not satisfied. I think they don't know very much and I advise him to continue looking for better more competent people to hire. I want to help him and I am frustrated he's not paying much attention to my advice.
