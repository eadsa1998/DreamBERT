I dreamt I was taking a bath and was holding a razor blade in my hand. The blade slipped on my leg and I cut a piece off of my leg and my foot came off. I called my mother to come immediately and told her to get the doctor. When she came to the bathroom I had already glued my foot back to my leg with the hope that the blood would coagulate and would harden and help keep my foot stuck to my leg. It was very loose though and my mother tried to help me. We finally decided it didn't look too bad, but we would call a doctor to fix it any how.
