I was in a youthful gathering with Adolf. I felt normal, perhaps somewhat happy. I did not feel indifferent. Some friends who did not get along with Adolf arrived, but he did not show outward displeasure, even though he did feel uncomfortable. He asked me for a dance, and I was afraid to hurt the others, but I saw something natural about them and I went over some furniture (it seemed like desks had been put together in a room for the gathering I was attending). And we danced, and I had a very agreeable and comfortable feeling.
