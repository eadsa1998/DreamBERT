 I am deer hunting. A deer is running across a field. I am there. The deer is running towards me slightly. I think of shooting to make the deer run directly towards me, but I don't. I do fire, and I hit the deer. It is a big deer: it looks like a horse! It has six or eight antler tines. It runs into a nearby wooded and field area and falls down. I'm with my hunting party looking for the deer. We're in a house. It is pouring rain outside, really hard. Out in the field I see a lightning rod that is being continuously struck with lighting. People had just put the rod up early in the day. People also put blaze orange panels on the roof of a house, like insulation. I go into a small room, which is empty, dirty, wet, and tan in color. My party and I walk through a hunting camp while looking for our deer. There are two guys hunting, but not for deer. They point us to our deer, which is about 100 feet in a different direction. We see it, and go get it. Most of the deer's antlers have fallen off. It has only two big tines remaining, like an antelope. I think it must not be the one that I shot because that deer had a big six or eight point rack. My hunting partner Jose Ramos says the rack on the deer I shot was bigger than six or eight points. There are pieces of bone and antler on the ground from where the deer fell and hit the ground. The pieces are cracked and broken. The pieces look eroded, and have holes in them. I talk with Franco Ramos, another hunting partner, who says he could have hit that deer. I tell him he couldn't have hit the deer from where he was, on the edge of the field near the other woods. I show him where his shot ended up and where mine did, which is about 50 yards apart. His shot would have had to been about 200 yards. He accepts that I was the one who hit the deer.
