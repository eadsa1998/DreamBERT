I was going to the H-- Theater with my brother and my Aunt R--. We didn't have any tickets so we were going to buy them when we got to the box office. There were two shows that night, the six o'clock show and the 8:30 show. My aunt and I wanted to go to the 6:oo show and my brother wanted to attend the 8:30 show. We argued for quite a while and then decided to each go our own way. My aunt and I then went to the ticket office to get the tickets, but there weren't any left for the six o'clock so we decided to wait for cancellations. The manager told us we were tenth in line waiting for cancellations. We waited and waited. At last, we decided it was futile, and we asked for tickets for the 8:30 show. However, there were none left for that show either. I felt very angry with my brother. I felt it was all his fault. I was brooding when my alarm went off.
