I am with my parents and we are at the house of family friends. Everyone is happy and having fun. We are all in the backyard and it is sunny and warm. I am mostly playing with the three kids (ages 5-9) but only one of them is easily recognizable to me. The two boys do not look like they should, although I know that it is really them. Most of the time I am playing with a little girl, age 9, who looks just like she should. Basically, this was a happy dream and nothing too exciting ever happened.
