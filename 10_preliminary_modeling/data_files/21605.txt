Shianne, our dog, was trained to walk over a car and adv. it by the way he walked and gave signs. Fisher and I were at church. He got out before me and as I was walking to catch up with him, I saw him away ahead. I met Margie S. I was glad to see her and she me. So we went back to find my car. We went by the back way. We climbed over fences and went up steps and finally we got over a fence and down a stairway and there was this spot we left the car. She looked over into another yard and there it was. We went over and, to my surprise, wrecked and demolished. A fellow came up to us and asked me if it was my car and I said it was. He said, "Wait a minute, they are going to sue you." I went into the rear of the car and I saw different state license plates on the car. I said, "This car is not my car." Marge turned out to be John Chepka and he said, "It is your car because your mechanic is making markings with chalk on it. I remember those and now I saw the fraud these two were pulling. I said, "Now how much will you give me for my car?" One of them said, "Give him $400," and I was going to ask them more for it. He was going to give us passes and give us 2 caps. I was on the street with the kids. Joe Arendas was in the street with kind of kids' carts. I copped a feel from a lady. I was going to the track. I picked up a paper and a form was in it. I looked at a program that was marked. I looked for the date and all I could see was 3, which did not seem to clear. I was in the country by Jake Polander, my uncle. I went to the toilet outside. When I entered, I was surprised the toilet seats were covered out of use. There was a toilet in the house now. There was a small hole where the toilet seats were on the board cover and it was close to the wall.
