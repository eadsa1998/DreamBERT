I dreamed I was riding in an airplane. The airplane was very old and dilapidated. I was very frightened. I do not have any recollection of anyone else being in the plane, however I was not the pilot as I was looking out the window all during the dream. I was definitely looking for something--I don't know what. Suddenly I saw a person on the ground below. The face became clear, and it was a fellow I used to go with. And then the plane zoomed high in the sky again and I lost sight of him.
