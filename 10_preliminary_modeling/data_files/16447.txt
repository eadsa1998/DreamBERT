Dad was in my studio surfing the internet on my machine for some reason, looking for gosh only knows what. And he was on the phone talking to somebody and I thought that he might have brought up one of my journal entries from my folder full of stuff, and so I just kind of said, "Dad, I'm sorry, but this is time and you have to move, you have to let me close this out." I closed it out and underneath it was the website that he had been looking at, and next thing I knew, I was sitting down in the chair and he was on the phone talking to some relatives. It was like I was listening in on a conversation almost. And I wasn't really on a website for any purpose; I was just exploring it. And apparently it was like a, you know the front of a Christmas cherub's (?) box that was real kind of crazy colors? That's what the theme of the website was for some reason. And I was kind of thinking, "Okay, I can do a search on the internet for anything I want." And shortly after that I woke up.
