 My friend Bubba Hacker calls my house on the telephone and speaks with my mom. He wants to get the price on a board _ inch thick. My brother Wally is home. We have no _ inch thick boards. We have a new refrigerator. In it is bread, a couple of tuna pies, and some fruit salad. In the Carter Church basement are some frozen pizzas.
