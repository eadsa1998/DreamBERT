I was in the car with Mom at a set of lights. I saw some flickers and it freaked me out. When I got to the lights, they turned red, but I went through anyway. The next ones were green. Then I was on foot, alone at night, and ran. I went down a street where people were throwing stuff. I had to go through a house to get back to the street. I went up some steps and couldn't find the house. I couldn't remember where I was and I was thinking it was a dream and saying "this is a nightmare".
