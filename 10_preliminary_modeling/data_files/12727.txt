I was at Mom's, but it was different. Ezra, Mom, Darren and I were leaving and I saw someone run into the house. Mom went in and called the cops. The guy ran out and went near the old person's home, which was a shop and was hanging around there. He started shooting and I hid behind a tyre on the car. I lay down and pretended to be dead because he started running over. He put the gun on me and was looking for the bullet holes. It turned into a 'movie' and he realized I had none and I grabbed the gun and said (though not me) "Blow on this!" and shot him. Later, I was at home and Clayton was there. I asked if anyone else was alive. He said everyone was. I went down the hall and my room and Dad's room were dark. The lights wouldn't turn on. I saw shadows in my room moving. I said that I knew it was a dream. I closed my eyes wishing for Ted Bundy, but then I woke up (dream within a dream).
