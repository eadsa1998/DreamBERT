Someone in a van took me to dads house, but it wasn't (it looked like it, but I didn't recognize it) and gave me an envelope to give to this person and they told me to say "Hello I'm Sam and I need to retract this envelope from you". The person was Jared Padalecki, although I didn't recognize him. I opened it and there was a charge of $2 and a cancel of a credit card. He was going to email them to find out who they were. Mom had a small car. It was squishy and they also had to sell a heap of their stuff?
