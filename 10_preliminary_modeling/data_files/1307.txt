Bonnie asks me to walk with her to go get something she forgot. We are packing for a trip. We walk down a hill and she asks if it will be too hard for me to wade in the water and grass. I am a little annoyed but say it's O.K. I slosh around a little unbalanced at times. I get the items she had forgot. They are metal refrigerator racks. As I'm walking back, Bonnie says, "Be careful!" I look around to see what the danger is. I see nothing amiss. She says, "There can be danger from salt." She means that when I hug the metal racks, corrosive salt could get on me. We go back up the hill and find ourselves in Mexico, in a park plaza sitting on a bench innocently flirting with guys. A Mexican cop comes and arrests me. I laugh because it must be some joke or misunderstanding. He is serious and takes me to jail. I tell Bonnie to help me, "Don't let me be forgotten." Then the cop takes me to the desk clerk. He says, "Here she is." I say, "Have you seen this face on any wanted posters?" She is unsure. I figure she should realize and let me go. She doesn't. We walk down long steps and corridors to my cell. Mostly guys are in this wing and it makes me nervous. Paulina and I are getting locked up in a tiny cell.
