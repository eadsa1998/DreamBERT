Faye and I in attic in our hometown. There were 2 babies present, parentage unknown. Faye said she hoped the older one would exert on the younger one a better influence than I had been on her, for (she went on by way of explanation) I, when a boy, was a swift runner, running races especially with (x) and the Brown boy; when these races were run in the park, I usually beat them by about 60 feet. I was also a good wrestler, with reputation of being "slippery as an eel." (Boys couldn't hold me). This narrative by Faye caused me to examine my skinny arms and to wonder what kind of excesses had prevented me from developing into a big man. Both Faye and I were in bathroom -- I in doorway -- preparing to take a bath. The tub was about 1/4 full of warm water. I was then just outside bathroom, and had begun to unbutton my B.V.D. I spoke to Faye and said, to save time, one of us should take a bath, no matter which.
