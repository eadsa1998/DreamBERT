I dreamed I was a dog.  I was on a trail behind some person, my master, and sniffing around the trail, and nosing my nose up to the person's hand.  I think I was a male dog.  I felt completely like a dog, not like a human feeling like a dog.  All the dog feelings came in, present sense impressions, and very present desires.  There was no future or past wondering.  After a while on the trail, I wanted to mate a female dog soon, I was anticipating that.
