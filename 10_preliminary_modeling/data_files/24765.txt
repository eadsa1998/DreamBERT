My brother and Katy were playing. Tayo comes in and says that Katy did something not nice. I finally got Katy to say sorry, and they were happy again. Then they went to my room and Katy was doing a headstand on my chair and she toppled over and Tayo caught her...and then I woke up. Setting: In the hall in my house, and then in my room. Characters: Katy (Tayo's little friend), Tayo, and me. Feelings and Thoughts: Angry. It's a little weird because I wasn't in that dream as much as I am in my other dreams.
