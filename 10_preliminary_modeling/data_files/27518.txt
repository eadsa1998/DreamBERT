I was walking up my street when I heard the wild barking of our dog. I shouted for him. I was very glad to see him bounding toward me with all his old vim and vigor. I said to myself that I knew he wasn't dead all the time. We played in the front yard. He barked just as loud as ever and looked black and shiny as before. I could hardly believe he was alive.
