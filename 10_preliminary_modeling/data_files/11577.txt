I was at a beach on the lake with a very tall blonde girl. We had been in swimming and were relaxing in the sun. She was an extraordinarily good-looking girl and was attracting quite a bit of attention from the other men on the beach. We then drove to her home and had sandwiches and beer. We then made a date to go dancing the next night, after which I went home. I do not know the girl to my best knowledge, I've never actually seen her.
