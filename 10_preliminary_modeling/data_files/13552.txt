I was at Max, Isobel and Eugene's (all from Roswell) house. I was helping with the gardening. There was this big container with plant pots in it. I didn't know much water to put in. Later there were plant pots near a shed. I thought I might water the grass. This frog had died in the container along with the plants. Their 'mother' gave us tea with superglue and sugar in it. Isobel was then at some place and had to distract this guy called Matt. She was hiding behind some bushes. I think they could change form too.
