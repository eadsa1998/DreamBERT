I was at school. It was the first day and I had finished the MUPC but I had to finish year 12. Everyone else from year 12 was there. I went to English, but then I realized I hadn't got my timetable yet. This teacher lady was giving them out. Calvin got one, then me and she said I needed to have a chat about Ezra. They wanted me to write to somewhere about him, using my university 'status' to make them do something. It cost over $1000. Elijah was the next in line to get a timetable. As I was walking to class, Eugene passed me and I was trying not to look and be subtle about it.
