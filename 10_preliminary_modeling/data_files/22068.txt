All night I dreamt about car accidents. I would frequently wake up feeling upset. It was a nightmare. It all stemmed from having seen a friend who had a bad accident the previous night. I also dreamt about three criminals who were hitting a man with an iron stick. I don't remember anything else, except that I woke up often, feeling upset.
