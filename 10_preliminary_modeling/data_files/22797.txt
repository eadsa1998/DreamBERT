Ronnie Engles, someone else, and I go into some kind of train yards to look around.  The boxcars we go in are full of junk, and some of the cars are so tall that I get the creeps standing beside them.  While we are in one boxcar with the door closed, some anonymous person suggests the "harmless" trick of burning the place down completely, but I say we'd better not, because they might not let us come back.   Ronnie and I then go to the studios of WTIZ.  It is pretty early in the morning.  Ronnie works there or something.  Some disk jockey is gone, and Ronnie asks me if I would like to take his place.  I tell him I would love to, but that I am afraid I will do something wrong.  So he asks me if I want some breakfast, and I say yes, so he fixes me some.  While I am eating, I ask who is broadcasting, and he says Eddie Fisher.  I look down the hallway but can't see him very well.  I ask Ronnie if he will introduce me to him, and he says yes.  While we are waiting, one of the two phones rings.  I answer and hear some lady singing loudly, so I hang up.  Then the other one rings.  Same thing.  This keeps up until I finally pick one up and start singing the first part of "Come Go With Me."  When Eddie Fisher does come out, he is introduced to a lot of people, and Ronnie introduces him to me, but he doesn't seem to hear.  He doesn't look like Eddie Fisher-kind of plump, with reddish hair.  We gets into an elevator with us, and I tell him how much I enjoyed his wife's movie (Tammy), and he thanks me.
