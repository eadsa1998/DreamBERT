I was with my parents on a long trip somewhere.  On the way, we stopped at a little shop.  There were cereals...blueberry, peach, and strawberry, with a piece of fruit embedded in every square of the cereal.  Then there were lots of people there, and we were supposed to pair up and do things.  I paired up with my smart, quiet high school classmate Linda. We were sitting at desks and had folder divisions up between pairs.  We were taking little balls of orange and white paint, I guess, and spinning them, and the patterns it made came out really pretty.
