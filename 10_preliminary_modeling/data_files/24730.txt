Well, all I remember was that I was asleep (in my dream) and I woke up and remembered that I didn't write in my dream journal. So I decided to close my eyes and try to remember the dream I had the night before. I couldn't, so I tried to remember my dream from the current night and couldn't. Oh, I remember that my mom came in to wake me and I said, "No, Mom! I'm trying to remember my dream!" Setting: In my room, in my bed. Characters: My mom was my mom, I was myself. Feelings and Thoughts: Worried, annoyed. I was annoyed at my mom for coming in, and I was worried that I couldn't remember my dream.
