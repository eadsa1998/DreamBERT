My mother wants me to go outside and enjoy the sunshine. I am lazily seated in a chair, like I haven't exercised in years. My father talks about his books. I ask why he's going to give them away if he loves them. He says he only loves a few of them. "But the music ones?" I ask. "Only a few; most of them were given by others and I have no interest in them."
