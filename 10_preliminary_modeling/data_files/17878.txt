My boyfriend Jeremy and I were in the truck in a large field.  It was sort of a scavenger hunt game- to find and correctly identify every cow in the field- there were about 20, and they were mostly black, so defining one from another would be difficult.  We identified one or two and came to one on a hillside that was being difficult.  Somehow to help in the identification, I started tickling it.  We ended up sliding down the hillside together, the cow on its back laughing hysterically.  I thought how few cows get to experience that- even being on its back much less laughing and having fun.  Jeremy and I ended up back in my parents' house somehow, and there was a horse.  Surprisingly I managed to mount the bucking bronco.  I'm not sure why- just to see if I could, I guess.  I rode for a few minutes and slid off, and in its struggle, the horse ended up on top of the stereo cabinet.  I was worried about the glass doors.  One got nicked or scuffed, but nothing broke and the horse finally got down.  Then we ended up somewhere else, near a house with an RV parked in front of it.  I was watching from 3rd person perspective again.  Jeremy and I didn't look like ourselves.  Somehow we had become paralyzed and were in wheelchairs.  We talked to the cops in front of the RV.  There was a blue woman with a red spot in her hair- a cherry tomato perhaps.  We told the cops she was responsible for our paralyzation.  Returned to 1st person view.  The cop asked to see some evidence and we showed them the welts on Jeremy's arm- they looked like paintball welts.
