I had the feeling of surprise when I saw several pages of written paper that had been sent to me by my father. I was therefore worried that I had to answer such a long letter. The image of my father appeared, but I couldn't see it well, though I could see it was my father and he seemed to be about 75 years old. The way I got the letter was rather vague. A young person, about 35, whom I couldn't see well, handed it to me. His figure in front of me was very fleeting.
