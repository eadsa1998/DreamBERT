I believe I was a teacher. I took a group of teenagers, along with another adult that I was working with, to some building. We went inside the building. It was a mess. It was dirty and rundown. There was little if anything inside the large room that we were in. I said this would be great. It seemed to be perfect for whatever we wanted it for. At that time, I don't know that I knew what we were looking for. The teens were complaining and such. We went to work cleaning it up and trying to make it usable. I came back into the room and the teens had done a great job fixing it up. There was furniture, pictures hanging on the walls, etc. I took a microphone and told them how very proud I was of them. I told them that I remembered what it was like to be their age, young, afraid, no one to talk to. I told them to feel free to call me at home anytime if they needed someone to talk to. I then handed the microphone to the other adult but don't remember anything that person said. Finally, I told the teens there would be one rule about this room. That rule is confidentiality. Anything that is said in that room stays in that room. That way they would feel safe discussing anything in there.
