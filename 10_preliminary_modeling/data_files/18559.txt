I visited the track maybe through something closed.. .I didn't know if I belonged to the home team or visitors. I walked back and forth on the track between home ??? I had made 2 necklaces. They were beautiful. Each was a string maybe hung with tiny little rocks, not sure? To be there next to you. Maybe the necklaces on me at the bank, not sure. "Lucky you're alive." The rocks got tangled and then POOF! Untangled. I was maybe, there were lots of magazines and 2 toy trucks, maybe a postal cart. First I saw a toy truck, flimsy, cheap, white with string. I didn't want to. There were wonderful magazines. "Science News," "U.S. News and World Science," "Space," It was Alan's stuff.
