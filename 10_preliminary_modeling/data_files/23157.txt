I was attending an end-of-semester faculty meeting at my former place of work.  Everyone was submitting their final grades, but I hadn't gotten the official class list that the grades were to be entered on, so I wasn't prepared.  I thought it might have been put in my box, and when I checked my box I found that it was stuffed, so I must not have checked it in a while.  There were enough copies of one issue of Readers Digest for my class, and a number of copies of some other small readers as well.  I was embarrassed that I hadn't gotten them to my class as I apparently was supposed to have.  But the grade sheet wasn't there.  I finally asked Jon Lane, whom I saw turn one in.  He gave me some sort of vague answer which wasn't any help.  I went through my briefcase/book bag desperately looking for it, and it wasn't there either.  I got so frustrated that I threw it into my cubicle, but I threw it too high and it sailed over the cubicle, flew across the room like a Frisbee, curved and sailed out an open window.  I wasn't sure whether anyone saw it or not.  I hoped it would land harmlessly outside, but I heard a loud scraping noise as if it had hit someone's car a glancing blow, and then I was really distressed, because it had my identification inside, and I was afraid I would be found and have to pay for the damage.  I was also worried about telling my wife Anita.  Finally I found a pile of the forms I was looking for--in plain sight.
