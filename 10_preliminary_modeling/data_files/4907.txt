["Whirlwind knocking at my door."] I am in a house and become aware that a large wind storm is approaching. I open the door and look out. A whirlwind is approaching. I shut the door quickly. I walk back across the room away from the door. I stand in the other doorway across from it that goes to another room. The whirlwind slams against the door like it is knocking. I realize with a small bit of concern that I am in the path of the whirlwind and could be hurt if it does break in. I think of moving out of the way, but I don't because I think it won't make it in.
