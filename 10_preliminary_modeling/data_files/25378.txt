 I am driving a small white car to the cabin, as if we own a cabin. I leave around 7:00 or 7:30 pm. While I drive there, it is dark outside. I spin out in the car, while on the road, for fun. I go to a driveway of a huge building with only two lights on. It is a dark road there. It seems like the building has something to do with my friend Nicole Peterson. I am in the driveway, which seems not to go to the building. I must have gone past the building, I think, and am going through woods at night. I am on a gravel road, and there are trees around me. There is a radio-controlled car 100 feet ahead of me in the road. I am steering it, but I'm in my car. I have a difficult time controlling it. I hit some buttons. The lights on the radio-controlled car go on and off. I turn them on. I have to turn the steering wheel of the car many times to get the radio-controlled car to turn. I get to the cabin, which is my house. I pull into the driveway going fast, and put the car in park because I am driving out of control and don't want to hit the house. The car doesn't jolt as much as I expected it to. I look at the clock. It is 11:38 pm. I get out of the car. It is light out. I walk to the back door. I think no one is home. I wonder if the key is by the door, since I remember using it earlier in the day, and I think I may have left it in the house. The screen door is open, and the key holder, which is about a foot long, is on the sidewalk by the steps. I go inside. The old wooden door from the back porch of the Oak Valley home is there, instead of the new door. The door is open. Inside the living room are my two brothers, Wally and another man his age. They are both wearing leather work boots and cornflower colored pants with no shirt. Another man is just coming in the front door. Wally asks me for my key. I say I put back earlier. He says that is right, because he used it earlier. It must be missing now.
