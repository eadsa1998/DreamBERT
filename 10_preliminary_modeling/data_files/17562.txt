I was laying on my blanket and pulling it out from under me- three pieces of it ripped off.  Then I lived in a different place, and had just moved in.  It was a smaller room.  There were bookshelves, a desk, and two chairs.  It was very cramped.  There was a twin bed, and I was still trying to figure out where to put it.  I saw an online acquaintance.  He wanted to see what my boyfriend Jeremy looked like.  I kept flipping through my albums trying to find a picture, without luck.  He put glasses on and held his hair back, and it looked like Jeremy.  Later on in a crowded place, Jeremy was there.  Something about my grandmas.
