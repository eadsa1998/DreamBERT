They won't let me sing my song. I'm a new member of a rock group, playing a guitar. The other members bring in new songs they've written and we do them. Then I shyly say, "I've written a song." The woman member sneers at me and says, "No. Not now." I say, "It's a good song. It has dynamics and really rocks." I was thinking she'd think it was badly written and wimpy. She isn't convinced. Another woman, as I had given up, says to me, "Let me try to convince her." The man singer kind of teases me. I say, "Hey, yours wasn't all that hot. I heard off-key notes and sometimes you were off beat. You were so noisy, you didn't hear yourself." He didn't believe me.
