I am in a big lecture hall auditorium attending a class on gospel singing. The other students in the class talk a lot and seem more interested in sports, especially in the Mets game. I get in trouble for talking during the class and ask the teacher, "Why ME?" I am banished from the room for my bad behavior, and I promise the teacher to leave if I am allowed to speak before the class for "just one sentence." I stand before them all and proclaim proudly, "You all know, I'm the biggest fan." Then I gather my papers and march slowly out of the room with pride.
