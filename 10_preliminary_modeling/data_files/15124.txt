I was friends with Sam and Dean (Supernatural). We went to this community to check it out. There was weird stuff happening to people. There was only like one girl there, but she got trapped. I was interested in Sam, but I wanted to like Dean and be with him. The girl there flirted with him. He disappeared. Then I couldn't find Sam. I called out "Sam!" and he replied and I found him in a building. I went in and it looked like a lounge room and was heavily decorated. The guy wasn't Sam and was actually the bad guy and said to me 'You're not going anywhere'. Then Sam came in through the door to help me, but then the door shut and locked. There was a thing with some water - you pulled it up to get the water, but something weird was in it so I left it. I was thirsty. Then it started getting hot and it was bright outside. I said to Sam that I thought it was all our worst nightmares. Two girls, young adults, were outside with beach outfits on. I asked them to open the door, but they couldn't. Then we managed to open it and we walked out. Then it was night. I freaked out and said 'now it's gonna be zombies!'. I saw some people up away from us, then heard a noise behind us and we ran. Zombies began chasing us. Sam had a small baseball bat and hit one. We ran to the group of people and were near a carpark. Molotov cocktails were lying on the ground, ready to go. Someone grabbed one and threw it; it exploded once and then finished off. Someone else went to throw one but it broke. Another exploded near a car. I was trying to get to a car. Then Dad was watching Burn Notice. Eugene was on a beach and called out and ran. He wasn't wearing pants, and we saw his butt. He then wrapped a towel around himself. There was a Russian guy there and he went up to him and said "Boris?". His bird was called Boris.
