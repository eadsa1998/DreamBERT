I walk into a big hall where there's a pancake feed going on. I feel very good, walking so easily and without pain. I pick up a huge tray of pancakes only cooked on one side. I carry them in and walk down a long line of tables. I see Aunt Rosalie and Uncle Gus seated alone near the end. I sit down across from them. I ask my mother to bring me a glass of milk, explaining that I had thought there was one here already, but it seems someone removed it. Uncle Gus stutters and drools a little. Aunt Rosalie looks emotionally exhausted and nervous. Someone asks me if I'm really going to ask him about the incest stuff and I firmly nod my head yes. I look at him and ask, "Tell me about it." He is shaken, like a child and scared. He stutters that he only did it to Darcy as a baby once and then Rosalie explained to him how it was wrong. He didn't quite see how, since Darcy wanted it, but it must be so. I realized he was a broken and ill man, not capable of understanding his own culpability. I laid off more questioning; it just didn't matter any more.
