I'm going back to college for a semester. It all seems so small, like I've risen above it. It is actually high school. I feel like a college student in high school. I don't want to meet with my friend Andrew because he is so depressed. His ego is so fragile it seems like the slightest thing will send him into a cycle of depression. The layout of the school is like my old high school and the nearby art center. I am near the town's lunch area. Andrew goes in to get some food. I start walking toward the arts center lunch area. Before this, I run into some old friends, the Kelly Gill crowd. I move around the corner, but it's empty. In my time away they've combined the lunches. But someone calls to me on the way. Off to the side, where I sat with lunch with my high school sweetheart Cindy that one day, as people saw us together as they walked on to lunch. They were in the grass. Like one girl I knew in high school and that sort of people. They mixed with my college friends. They all wanted to get up and go. We went somewhere. Before that, I showed them pictures of my painting on the wall. Peeling a fruit like it had layers, like it was a part of the wall. The fruit, which Andrew bought, looked like a large gourd. It turned into a tent. Most were very impressed with my work. But Andrew had painted a less-good slogan over my good friend Doug's famous words in darker colors. The fruit peeling, I found the layer that had been painted and then grown over. People wanted to go someplace... so we left.
