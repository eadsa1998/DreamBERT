During lunch at school two of my girlfriends went to the mall with their mothers during school. When they came back at lunch, they each had a nose ring, and a lip ring. They said they were on sale at Sears. Me and my other three girlfriends got in a fight with them, but then the bell rang and we all had to go to math. This dream was unpleasant.
