 I'm playing softball with my high school geography teacher Gary Kline, his daughter and my classmate Macy Kline, my friend Ivory Alshire, a classmate from Brimson Stacy Lockhorn, and others. We use hard, crisp, red, rubbery bouncy tomatoes as softballs. I'm the catcher. Gary is the umpire. One runner gets home. Then we get a force out at home plate, I tag a runner out, and I tag Macy at 3rd base. Gary wasn't at third base to make the call. He was behind some sort of a pillar. As Macy scrambled to get to 3rd base, she slowed down and my movements slow down. I feel like I am in super-slow motion: it is difficult to move. I tag her just before she reaches the base. I call Gary over and ask him if she was out, hinting that she was. The call was disputable, but because we had the force out at home anyway, the inning ended.
