I had changed my Facebook status a while ago. I had released a book and I had said that I got an e-mail about it and I had been like 'what the hell, oh that'. Seamus said he had gotten it too and had forgotten who I was. Another status of mine said I had woken up with $55 in my bank account and it said I had spent the rest on sex -- one night stands two days in a row. One of the guys had been black? I think I was pregnant.
