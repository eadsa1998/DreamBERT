Dreamt about my new boyfriend Jeremy.  It seemed like we were in Toys R Us.  We climbed in a ball pit together or something.  Hugged and whatever.  I remember walking back to the line with my mother, and going outside, and then back in?  Then at a construction site at night.  I made some friends, and we walked around.  I think we stopped there to get some things (in the state) before going back out of state (walking...not far).  On the return trip I got lost.  Was walking around like behind cabins and things.
