On 21st I was slate in rising. Wouldn't have time for breakfast. Told mother I would just snatch a piece of buttered toast to eat on my way. But the dressing room in the basement was crowded, tables partly cleared and no waiter. Mrs. McC asked me what I wishes and told me Ai. would get it for me if I went to the kitchen. Remembered she was dead, it can't be she. Ai. Is with difficulty persuaded to give me what OI could carry. Sliced very large pieces of bread and laid them on others thickly buttered to spread them. I remarked on the clever way of spreading bread. There was no time for toast. It was 7:50, ten minutes to class time.
