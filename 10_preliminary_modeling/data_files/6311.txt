My third dream was about me going to visit my girlfriend in the hospital. In real life, she is currently wearing a neck brace and an arm sling due to some guy hitting my car from behind. However, in the dream, I pictured her being much worse lying in a hospital bed. How much I wanted to kill the guy who put her there.
