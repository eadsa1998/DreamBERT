I was in a classroom teaching girls several things about cosmetics, hair care, etc. I remember getting into a big discussion on the virtues of natural bristle hair brushes vs. nylon ones and the correct way to brush hair. The class was about 3 girls about age 18 in a classroom much like we had in high school (fixed desks, and old building). The girls all paid attention and discussed things well. This one I think is rather simple--I sell brushes and am often asked to tell the virtues of the natural bristle over the nylon--especially to high school age girls. I also have to talk about our cosmetic line--a really hard subject for me.
