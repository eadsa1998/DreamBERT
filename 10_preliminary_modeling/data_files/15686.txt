There was a new movie with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. Frost's last name was also Pegg (which wasn't 'real' but was like a nickname that had happened before they met). It involved time travel. When Frost was a kid he had a toy called 'Pegg' and it was something that he liked and that was how he got the name. Pegg went back in time to stop it and see what happened but he died and then it showed Frost as an adult 'die' and Pegg was upset and crying and everyone was saying it was like the most depressing movie ever.
