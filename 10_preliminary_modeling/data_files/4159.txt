I am in some large building and am in charge of keeping people from going up to the 2nd and 3rd floors. I see a black man and several white people going up the stairs. I scurry over saying You can't go up there. They laugh at me and go up anyway. I go up there to get them out, worried that they will steal things. I see a group of old ladies at a long table in one hall. I ask what they are doing. They say they are attending a workshop that will last 60 days. I decide it's OK for them to be there. I go back downstairs, tired and overwhelmed. Then I realize I could hire someone to keep an eye on the upstairs. I go to a desk where a woman (Diane of Uni house) sits with a hat that says Wonder Woman. She is very busy and doesn't pay any attention to me. I see Ginny. She tells me she is staying at a different hotel and will be having dinner out with other friends. I am surprised and a bit hurt. Then I see Ginny is sad. I try to cheer her up. I decide to join her at the other hotel. She points down a hall and says I can get my key holder there. I go down there and see a Christmas tree display with crochet white key holders. Is this it? I ask. She says yes.
