Mom had a different car and I got in the passenger seat (which was the opposite side like an American car) and the door behind me kept opening. I was trying to lock the car as I was sitting in it, but it just kept popping open. I complained to Mom when she came and she said it kept doing that you had to slam it. Later I was at Dad's house, which I was looking after while he was away. It was actually this huge, expensive place which was next to these other fancy, expensive places. I was going through his cupboards and fridges throwing out stuff that was out of date and cleaning up the place.
