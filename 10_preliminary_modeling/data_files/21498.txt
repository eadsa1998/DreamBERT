Ann and I went camping with Carters. We made a campfire on two occasions. I found a lot of wood stick matches. I filled my pockets with them. Ann and Bernice walked across the ice over the Cuyahoga River. At White's we were taking home things the company didn't want. I found two large wooden boxes I wanted. I saw Horton walking by. I called to him and asked him to give me a requisition for the boxes. I met Bill S. and he said, "If you take two boxes, they will open one and look it over. And if you take one box, they will look over the one." I was puzzled for I wanted something in the box that I didn't want them to look over. I drove my car to where the boxes were and George G. and Bob had one up high on top of a ladder and it crashed to the ground, breaking apart. There was snow on the ground. I drove my car up a small bank and when I was going to back down the bank, there were about 4 concrete steps I had driven up.
