I looked for a snow horse because I thought of one and on glass I scratched with my nail and snow man or snow appeared on the glass. There was a lot of snow on the ground. Bob was riding his bicycle and he had the seat or rear end somehow turned up where it would interfere with his rear view. I looked up into a tree and there was a pigeon sitting on a branch right above me. I moved away for fear the droppings would fall on me. I was flying or sort of floating in the air above the doorway by the ceiling. I floated downstairs to where Bob sat and at him, but he was doing breathing exercise and paid no heed to me. Then I was in bed. Something seemed to surround me and sort of put a pressure around my body that I thought I wouldn't be able to move, but I tried to raise up and I did, overpowered it and it turned out to be a woman in my bed. I got on top of her and intimated her. She got up and went into the other room, but I held onto her dress that was so long. I towed or pulled it in and pulled her back. She seemed to be my wife and still not. I got on top of her and intimated her again.
