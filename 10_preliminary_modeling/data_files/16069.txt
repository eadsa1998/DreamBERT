Samantha, Sandra and Derek lived in the Farley's house and that Dad's first wife was really Cassandra. And everything was going on. I was sitting, eating my supper, and I had turned some show on, and Mom and Dad were both saying, "Go away, go away." And so I got up and left. I turned off the TV and got up and left. And then Mom wanted to go to Seven Eleven with me, and she was mumbling to her self, "Bars, bars, bars -- all we ever go to is bars." And then I woke up.
