Leonardo DiCaprio was a character who was a 'bad' guy and visited a guy. Leo was pretending to be him and had the same accent as he did in Shutter Island. The guy suddenly yelled "when was the last time you woke up listening to 8 Mile! That whole movie and one little song" and he responded with "I know, right!". The guy realized it was a test. He got a job to pick up this 19 year old girl. He went to a carpark to get here and she was actually a transvestite who looked like Anthony Perkins. She got in the car and the driver was now a female and put music on, which sounded very sexual. Anthony Perkins got upset and got out of the car. The Academy Awards were on and Antonio Banderas had said he wanted some weird looking guy to win and was like "this is what I want" and everyone else was like 'who the hell is he to say that?'. A lot of the winners were very odd choices, but Christoph Waltz won. There was a bit for TV shows and Rainn Wilson was in the newspaper.
