["Supervising counselors should have more experience."] I am at some workshops for counselors. I am listening. After it is finished, a woman comes over to me with a piece of paper with her suggestions on it. I read it. Next time, she would like to see some information on having supervisors have more experience than the ones they supervise. Then she has other things. I comment that this wasn't the topic area we were doing. She's more into how to improve teaching counselors and the workshop was on better counseling. The last line was a series of colors mostly mauve and purple except one aqua blue.
