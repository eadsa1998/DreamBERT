I was in a car with Mom. Somehow I discovered that we were related to Darius. He was the "biological" son of Ivan with some woman. She said something that made me doubt it, so I asked what the last name was. She didn't remember but asked how many people would be called Darius. I asked if the last name was Ivanovich and she said it sounded right. She said that we had met before. I was thinking that I needed to text Calvin and that Evelyn would be happy about this. I was also thinking that I was glad it wasn't Eugene that I was related to. He was in a movie playing at this weird theatre. This guy gave people remotes and the guy next to me kept talking to me. I left. I was then somewhere with Nana. She had this video of Darius and a weird town which was mushed in a bowl. She had all these Pokemon Pearl games for the GameBoy Advance and I was wondering why she had them. Later, I was in a car with Ezra, waiting for Mom. We had 'P' plates.
