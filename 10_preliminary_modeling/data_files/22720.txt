This is a rather vague dream without much of a plot. It's about a problem I have with some person, I can't tell who. She calls me on the phone and we have a fight. Then a series of people whom I don't know appear. Then I am walking on the street with a friend and we arrive at the bowling alley. Then we appear at the university theater where a play about feudal times is being rehearsed. Among the actors there are some people I know, like a girl who went to school with me, and in this play they were laughing at her because she couldn't jump due to her fatness. From there the problem with the phone comes back again. A cousin of mine goes to my house to ask me to clear this matter, which results in a fight, and to apologize in case he had been the one at fault. But I don't want to see him, and I speak with his sister and explain everything to her. She blames her other sister and a painter. The dream disappears.
