I was watching an episode of The Outer Limits which was set at a bar with two girls and two guys. One girl was blue. The others were talking to the other guy and saying how she and this guy had had sex with the other girl and she had had a baby. They went off and after a while a fat lady came in and died. The guy got up and left. He couldn't breathe, but he knew it had something to do with gravity. I was in there for a second and I kept trying to breathe. He went in this house and then in his car and the guy drove them to place where they were experimenting. I had my diary. It showed the people leaving the bar and 'what would've happened if...?' It showed me watching it. Dad was in the way, as were some fishies. I was watching Dad. Ezra was nearby.
