I awoke from a sleep in the kitchen on a chair. Audrey and Bob were there awake. I saw an overcoat hanging on a nail. I asked Audrey if the doctor was here and she said yes. At first I thought the doctor was behind his coat, but he wasn't. He was upstairs by Grandpa and I felt sorry for Grandpa. I started up the stairs to see him and the doctor. I was sort of pulling myself up by the banister. Grandpa had an object pointed at me. He said, "All I have to do is blow this poison on you." I yanked the thing out of his hands and went into the house. Joe Lasko (deceased) was there. I locked the door so Grandpa wouldn't come in. He seemed to want to kill me. Joe Lasko was in a crowd with me. He started to follow some guy and it looked like he would get into trouble. So I went after him and two guys were after him. When they saw me coming, they started to go the other way and I followed them for a while, then let them go and went back to Joe. A fellow approached me and started to inquire about Joe. I answered his questions, then a young lady, her daughter and mother came by. He started to talk to the mother. He knew her and he said, "How about a date tonight? You remember you said you would give it to me." He repeated that a few times and then the mother said ok.
