I was at some place and I was watching a live Monty Python thing on the TV. Terry Jones kept stuffing up his lines. In the water there was this shark thing and Stan from South Park was underneath it; the shark was protecting him. The shark swam away and he came up for air, holding his hat and he was covered in mud.
