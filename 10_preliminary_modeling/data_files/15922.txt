I was sitting at Cecelia's and sitting at a table and lots of people were around. Frederick had been acting weird and he came up and said 'Izzy, I like you' and I just put my head down. It was a bit awkward but everyone else just got back to talking and he went away. I didn't know what to say or do. There was a photo of us on Facebook from a while ago with a caption like 'I am in mild love with Izzy'. Jason was also around and I wondered if he knew (he was also in the pic but maybe he thought it a joke). I was with Frederick later talking about something and I wanted him to just do something because I was really horny but I left the room sighing with frustration. [stayed at Cecelia's that night, sharing a room with Frederick and had been thinking the same].
