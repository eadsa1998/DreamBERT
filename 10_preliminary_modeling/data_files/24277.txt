There was a murderer who came into my longtime friend Chris's house, and said I will kill you, but not now. When you least expect it. I couldn't sleep well on the couch. Kept feeling smothered and hot. Prickly from the down feathers coming out. I was waiting for it, wondering -- when he does try it, would I be prepared? I wanted to act and get him. But the door was locked in the front with a key, so I couldn't escape if things turned bad. He was keeping watch, making sure none of us could leave the house.
