Frank is angry at me for spending too much money. Shift: I am in the kitchen and have some friends help me dip the chicken in a sauce. After we eat, Frank takes our whole family to the movies as a Christmas treat. shift: there is a liturgical dance (like at the Retreat Center) but my partner is not there, so I ask my friend Hillary's daughter, Sara to take her place; She is quick to follow instructions and all goes well.
