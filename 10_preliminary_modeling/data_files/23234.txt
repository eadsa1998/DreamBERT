A number of former colleagues are involved.  The details are very fuzzy now; I just remember Jack Ramsey serving me a tiny glass-smaller than a shot glass-of some kind of white liqueur that was very tasty and made me want some more, but I was reticent about asking for more.  Marleen O'Hare, typically, was sympathetic to me for some reason; and Jerry Schwarenegger, typically, was boisterous. Jack went to get my mail, and came back with a packet of letters which he said were all from the same person.  I wondered if (and dreaded) they were all from Judy Cook, asking for recommendations.
