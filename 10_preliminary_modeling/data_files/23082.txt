Our house was a ramshackle affair in a poor part of town.  I was going to take a bath and found that the tub was outside, balanced precariously on a single board projecting from the house beside the porch.  Besides, the tub was very flimsy, and there was a gap between the bottom and the side near the porch, so it obviously wouldn't hold water.  A man -- a neighbor, I guess -- was over there looking at it with me, but he didn't seem too concerned.  We went inside, and I found we had a wood-burning stove.  There were only two burners, too.  The same man found a piece of "carpenter's wood" or "log" in the fire and hastily retrieved it.  He also found another in our wood pile.  He confiscated that one too, and rebuked us for burning them.  It was a short, thick, light-colored and rather porous log.  Sometime during this dream, my wife Bonita was going to ride somewhere with a couple in a small sports car.  I was going to go in another car, but decided to go with them instead.  This part had a small-town high school summer atmosphere.
