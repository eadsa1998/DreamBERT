 I'm arriving home from Australia. I'm walking down 2nd Street in Oak Valley, going west on the south side of the road. I'm in between Home and Next Avenues. I see my mom and my sisters Heather and Ramona ahead. I'm very happy to see them! I slip on the ice, but am not hurt. I get back up quickly so they'll see I'm ok. I try to fly to make sure that what I'm experiencing is real, to make sure it's the real coming home. I can't fly, and conclude this must be real. We meet near the intersection of Home Avenue and 2nd Street. I hug Ramona, and maybe Heather. Then I hug my mom for a long time and cry. I am very happy to see her: it has been so long since we've seen each other! It's a very emotional moment.
