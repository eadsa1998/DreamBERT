 I'm traveling in three feet of snow. I'm on a journey. There is an Indian and a woman with me. It is hard to move in the snow. I'm a foreigner. We share the food that we get. Crows are our main food source. I hear a crow. We walk towards it. I see a black mass that I think is a crow. It is between a "Y" fork in the branches of a tree. I throw a snowball at it, and hit it. I stand there with the woman looking up into the tree. There is an Asian woman standing in the fork of the tree branches. She is dressed in a black cape that buttons down her chest and drapes over her shoulders. She is about 15 or 20 feet up in the tree. Her eyes are closed. She stands or sits there, very content, in the middle of the forest. I speak to her, trying to get her to come down. She does not need or want my help. Her long narrow eyes open slightly, like I have disturbed her. I speak to her, questioning and encouraging her. I'm a little afraid of her: she seems unpredictable, like she could do anything at any moment because she does nothing. I'm afraid she may descend from the tree in an instant and kill or hurt me. I may say something about evangelicalism. It seems the woman is a nun, for lack of a better description. She is peaceful, content, poised, calm, wise, serene, and enlightened.
