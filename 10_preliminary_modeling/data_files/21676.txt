Fisher and I were working with Malley McPhail. He seemed to be in movie making. I went down the street a ways and Malley was backing up his panel truck down the street. He must have backed it about 3 blocks. I wondered why he didn't turn around and drive forward. My dad and brother Steve were working. They came to the clock and I with them. Malley was down looking at something and was in our way. He got up fast. I was surprised. We punched out time and went out. I met Andy Palider working in the stock room. We walked to a door and there was a drop of about 13 ft. Andy wanted me to jump down. He gave me a little push, but I hung on and said, "That's a little too high. You will jar your body too much." He jumped down. I think I jumped before at a distance of about 10 ft. height before. We were talking of directions with Malley. He said east was in back of us. I looked in that direction and the sun was rising. We went into the back house on E. 68th St. I looked and there was Trixie, our old dog. She was dead. Her head was on the floor and part of her body was there. They were apart, the head and the body. I told Bob to take it away. I took Judy in the shop down into the flats and the girls liked her. I gave her a sandwich. She ate it, then puked it up. We were playing with a small baby. She would expel water thru her mouth.
