The first one was that Mom and Dad and I were taking one of our long road trips, and it wasn't too long because it was in the state, but still up to the capital, I consider that long. But where my dream started was that we were in this big bed and breakfast type place. It was kind of sort of like a hotel, just ____________________ people can stay. But it had ____________ rooms with nice, homey furniture like a bed and breakfast. And our whole family was staying there. There was Mom and Dad and I and there was, I had the feeling that Uncle Carl was there and Diana and we were all gathering there to _____________________ ______________________. And this is like a stop-off point for us before we actually meet up with her. And in this dream it was kind of nice because I had my own like _____ bedroom type room. It was almost like a suite. I had like a big bedroom, _____ bathroom, and I could shut the door, and it was totally separate from Mom and Dad's space because usually whenever we go on a trip __________ or we go to somebody's house and we end up staying, I have to ___________ Mom and Dad, and, you know, I don't have any real issues or anything when it's just _____________ sleeping with both of them because, you know, I feel like I can't move, I can't, you know, do anything without being noticed. And here I felt really comfortable because I was in my own room, I was folding my clothes and I was putting them at the foot of my bed, and I had the radio on and I was brushing my hair and I was generally getting myself together. And I think I just _______________ or shower and I was naked, and I had to go and find Mom and Dad's room because Mom had my really pretty dress that _____________ that I was going to wear. [laugh] And so I opened the door and I'm in this huge like _______ and I'm totally naked, and I think I know which is Mom and Dad's room. And I open the door, and it's not. It's the men's exercise, weight-lifting room. [laugh] But __________ there was no one in there at this time. And then I opened another door that was Mom and Dad's room, and Mom was doing something to my dress, like sewing it or something. And so I had to sit a few minutes to kind of wait for her to finish. And I felt a little bit funny, like maybe something was the matter. You know how some of the little tips turn into big things and some of them are just little things. Well, I felt like one of the little things was going on and I wanted to get back to my room, but I needed my dress. And eventually Mom gave me my dress and I kind of put it on in there so I wouldn't have to walk naked through the foyer again. And then I went back to my room and fiddled around a little bit more. I think I had the radio on again, I was folding clothes again and doing something, packing a bag or something. And then I wanted to see if there was a big TV like on a _______ type of thing. And it must have been on _____________ blasting pictures at me, and I couldn't figure out what it was. But I figured, "Well, I should find a way to turn this off. What is this doing on? I'm not going to watch it. We're getting ready to go somewhere." And so I felt around across the top and down the side and I couldn't really find any way to turn it off. So I said, "Oh well, it's not really hurting anything. I guess I'll just leave it on." And then the craziest part of all [laugh]. Some lady or girl or somebody that I kind of thought I knew was laying in my bed with a bunny rabbit, a real live bunny rabbit, just sort of cradling it in her arms. And I was petting it and I thought it was the sweetest thing ever. And I was thinking, "Oh how nice -- she has a pet bunny." And I don't' remember much more about that. I remember when we were petting the bunny, we were just kind of hanging out waiting to go off. And then I woke up and kind of rolled around a little bit. It was daylight, but I went back to sleep. And during the 7:00 o'clock hour I had a dream that kind of felt weird, like maybe it was a non-REM dream or something. It was just kind of boring and nothing to it. I dreamt that I lived in Penelope's complex, but it wasn't like the real Westminster P_____. In my dream there was a very barren-like gray walls and gray like squarish hallways. It was almost like a prison or something. And it kind of put me to mind of _________'s kind of world, in the hallways that are in it. And I just think, "Oh, who would want to live here?" And so I was in a room right next door to Penelope and I was going to Modern Media College at the same time. Talk about mixed up! And I don't even remember what I was doing. I just remember feeling kind of alone and like I had no place to really go and do anything with anybody. And I was just kind of stuck there, like almost in a prison. And then I woke up.
