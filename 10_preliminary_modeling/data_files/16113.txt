I was going to show Mom where the Warrior Vision room is, and it was supposedly in the Bell Building. And it was past the bathrooms and now, in my dream, it was turned into somebody's bedroom, almost like a hospital room, only it was really pretty decorated. And I asked Mrs. Talmadge, "Where is it this year?" and she handed me a set of keys and led me down this set of stairs in like a cellar in the Bell Building. And then before I knew it, the steps led to outside. And she lifted this cover off the ground and showed us a little panel about twelve inches long and about six inches wide with just two or three knobs on it and said, "This is our panel. This is what we use. This is the extent of our equipment now." And she lifted another cover and there were these mint candies in that cover, and I took a handful. And she lifted another cover and there were cinnamon candies, little green ones. And then I woke up. That was strange.
