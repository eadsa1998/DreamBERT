I was at a shop with Dad. They had videos and Dad wanted to subscribe. We found this 'grieble' thing except it was spelt wrong. We couldn't think of anything else to get. There was a chocolate section. There were giant chocolates with an area of 1m2 and this kid ran up to it and it was bigger than him. His mother went to get him and the chocolate started slipping and I went to grab it but it slipped through and landed on the kid, but he was ok. Dad complained because I didn't get it.
