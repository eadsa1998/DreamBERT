["Celebrating Dad."] I am in a house sitting at a round table. I think this is my parents' house, although I don't recognize the house. It doesn't actually exist. Just the table. I am living with them or visiting, I'm not sure. I have at least 1000 dollars. I am trying to figure out how to make more money with it. Maybe I gambled for it or just had good luck, I don't know. Now I am outside and my father is standing in front of me. He turns to face me and is talking about the things he's done in his life. I look beyond him and see a long line of relatives coming out of the trees into the meadow we are in. They are coming to the celebration of my father's life. It is supposed to be a surprise for my father so I keep him talking. I think he knows, and is cooperating. Now they are all seated at a long table. I stand at the head of the table and begin a speech chronicling my father's life and accomplishments. After I am done, I realize I didn't ask for any input from my brothers and sister. I apologize to Lydia, saying I was rolling along and never thought to ask them if they had anything to say. They don't seem to be bothered. I walk around. I see Aunt Elaine. I look at her face. She looks different. I think she looks fine. I wonder why my mother hates her. I like her just fine. I see Suzanne who hasn't seemed to grow up. Maybe she is 15 years old. I try to calculate how old Elaine is. It doesn't make sense. I walk around more and see Patricia. Her face is much older, wrinkled. I am surprised. I also see Grandma Anne and am surprised to see her as she is dead. And then Chester. Who is also dead. It is quite the Sanders reunion.
