Some people I don't know and I were at some strange place. I was older. Baby and Otis (both House of 1000 Corpses) were there. Otis shot someone and then he went inside this shed thing. This girl and I went over to it and we were talking to him and then he snuck the gun around the corner and I was like "Don't shoot me!" and he said "Don't worry I wouldn't hurt anyone as pretty as you," and I was like, quote: that noise that Rik Mayall always makes. Then we got trapped in this freaky place and there was all this food and the doors were all shut and locked but I found this door that wasn't locked and these two orange dragons came towards me and we all ran up the stairs and Otis got me and some other people to follow him and we ended up in this big orange room with these ribbons hanging from the ceiling and the dragons came in. There were evil people watching. We followed this orange ribbon to the wall and then went a little lower and we were swinging with these ribbon things. Then Rik Mayall was on the stage with his youngest daughter, Bonnie and then she touched something and then they went in this room and there was an explosion. Rik came out of the room crying, saying she had been blown up, and then there was something about his son getting sick.
