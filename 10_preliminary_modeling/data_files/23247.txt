I meet Justice Clarence Thomas and the late Justice Abe Fortas.  I don't remember anything about meeting Justice Thomas except for mentioning the fact to Justice Fortas, and I don't remember a lot about the latter either, except for going down a very large outdoor stairway to his gardens, meeting him at the bottom of the stairway and being shown a huge living room through a large glass window; the living room had lots of comfortable couches and chairs at various angles in various parts of the room.  Fortas offered me tea.  He was very cordial, and quite young, nothing like in real life.  His house was in Texas.  I won the visit with him as a sort of scholarship, apparently.  I had a hard time of thinking of subjects to discuss on the same plane with a Supreme Court Justice.
