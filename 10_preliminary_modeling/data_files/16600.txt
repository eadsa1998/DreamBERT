It's the day before my birthday, man, and I'm feeling a whole lot better. Thank goodness! I don't know what hit me the other day. But last night I had kind of a stupid dream, but I think it makes a little bit of sense. I dreamt that Mom and I were in the park, laying on a blanket, and it was kind of cloudy in the sky, but not really going to rain or anything. And she was having a look across the lake with my distance _______ to see somebody over there that was going to be water skiing. And get this: my distance _______ had this flat plastic boggling (?) figure of Goofy on it dangling from the lanyard thing on an extra string, and Mom said that that was supposed to indicate the reference point of where the ground level was. Now what that has to do with anything, I don't know. But I looked across the lake and I saw the water skier, and he water-skied by and I was thinking, "Okay, so what?" So a little while later Terri showed up. She brought with her a schedule for me because I was starting high school the next day, except it didn't look like the little sheet of paper that Westport High School used to give me every year. It was a full sheet of paper like I get from Modern Media College like I print out from their web site. And it was formatted just like they did. So I was going to go to Westport High School again. I only had to go to two or three classes a day, but I had to get up at like 6:00 in the morning to be at school by 7:00, and I was thinking to myself, "Oh gosh, ______ are going to kill me; I hate doing this." And then the scene shifted and I was at an art show with Mom. And I was helping her pack stuff up. We were folding chairs and loading stuff in the truck. And Courtney and Haley were there. And then I woke up. Now, as you probably know, Haley just moved down here and she's enrolling in Southwest High School, so that's probably where that came from. And, oh, let's see what else. Mom has an art show coming this Saturday, so I think that's where that came from. This is just rather dumb, I think.
