I was raising and hatching these baby chicks; there were about five or six of them, and I had eggs in an incubator. And I don't remember too much about the incubator part, but it was like this box that I had that I was hatching these eggs. And it was like a f______ project, and I seem to remember the chickies coming out, and there were three yellow ones, a brown one and two black ones. And, you know, they were hopping around doing their thing, and I was thinking, "Oh, how cute! I can take these to the fair and show them." And then, I can't remember, something else was going on. Some elderly woman took me to this big, open hall type thing, and there was tons of stuff going on; I can't remember exactly what. But when I came back, I realized that the black chickie had run away, something happened to the brown one, and the three yellow ones had died because I forgot to feed them anything before I left for the big, open hall. I think I had given the brown one away, the black one ran away and the three yellow ones had died. And I'm so disappointed and so heart-broken that here I let these chickies just die because I didn't feed them, I didn't have a chance to feed them or get them any of that baby chick starter stuff before I went to the big, open hall thing. And that's when I woke up. And the funny thing about this dream is that the next day we went to a garden-like place, and there was a frog right by a little map sign thing, and I used to pick up frogs all the time and put them in my pocket. But then a couple years ago I started getting really grossed out when I touched them. But this time I just picked up that frog like I used to do when I was little, and held it in my hand for a few minutes and let it go. And I was appreciating its creature-hood, if you know what I mean. And I was glad that this creature didn't end up like the baby chicks in my dream.
