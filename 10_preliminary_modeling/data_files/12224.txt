I went to the shop. Daryl and his family were there. I had had a feeling that they were going to be there so I had put on a bra (which I always do anyway). I went to the toilet and Gilbert was bragging about some girl. Daryl punched him. There was some 'bbb' thing in a hat. I was watching Whose Line is it Anyway and Colin Mochrie was on.
