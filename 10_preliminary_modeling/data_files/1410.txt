I am in the M City house. Snow is all over the floor. A lump is in the center. It may be my Mexican ceramic cat all covered with snow. I look up at the walls. They have been stripped and new wallpaper is going up. I explain to someone that my mother has decided to wall paper. I comment that I prefer paint. I don't like wall paper, but oh well!
