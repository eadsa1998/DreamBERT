My mother, father, sister and I went over to England where we had a big house with about 6 bedrooms. I started going around with Princess Elizabeth and since she was not supposed to associate with commoners, she had to sneak in and out whenever we were together. Then I met her brother, and we liked each other a lot. He wanted to marry me but I hadn't forgotten about my present husband back in the U.S. I don't remember, but I think we were engaged then. Anyway, I knew that if I married the Prince, he would be disliked by many and I would be in society for the rest of my life -- what happened, I don't know because I woke up. I remember talking to someone about the ocean trip -- I said that I hadn't gotten seasick on the large ship we sailed on -- this "someone" said she had sailed on a smaller ship and got terribly seasick. Also, I remember talking to several people about the food in England --I was shocked because I was getting plenty of food to eat and I had heard so many stories about the poor supply of food in England. Incidentally, I also remember telling someone in England that the Prince looked just like my husband fiance then) -- Also I hated to hurt my fiance and I thought that he might have been afraid of something like this happening when I left the U.S.
