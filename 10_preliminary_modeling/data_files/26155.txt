 I'm in a room with my housemate Stephen Ramos and a salesman that seems to be working there. There is a huge television screen, about 10' by 20'. The man shows up clips from the movie Romeo and Juliet. The perspective shown on the screen is really close up, so close that it's fuzzy. The digital projection isn't good at such a close range. The screen is very bright, white, and I squint: I can barely look at it. In one scene Romeo talks with red, slobbering lips, saying "Sweetest dreams". Later, he says "I said 18,000 goodbyes and they let you go." He is sad about this, and Juliet comforts him. Later, Juliet says to Romeo, "You collapsed."
