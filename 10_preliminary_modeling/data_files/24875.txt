I was walking down a street with three friends of mine and then I had to leave them. So I went into this really big grocery store. This is in Ireland. Anyways, so this group of kids came up to me and one of them asked me if I could help him in his English workbook and I said fine. He asked me what 15.5 was, and I said fifteen and a half. Then he said, "Oooh. I forgot. Okay." Then they said thanks and the dream ended. Setting: In Ireland, in a large grocery store. Characters: My three friends Courtney, Anne, and Amara. My mom I know. And the group of kids I don't know. The one I was talking to was short and chubby with blonde hair and BIG glasses. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy. I thought it was a pleasant dream. Nothing bad happened, but nothing extremely exciting.
