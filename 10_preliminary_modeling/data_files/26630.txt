 I'm at home talking with my mom. She comes towards me as I handle a condom wrapper or a condom that is like a spool of thread. I don't hide the condom, and by not doing so I expose a part of myself to her. I think: if others can be open about their sexuality, why can't I? My mom is concerned about my supply of lotion. I have two full bottles of lotion, which I never really use, that I show her. There is some fuss over them, maybe regarding their cost.
