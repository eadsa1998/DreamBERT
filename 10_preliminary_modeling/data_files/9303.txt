I was at Jennifer F's wedding. The reception was ending and the family were all cleaning up the reception area, getting everything packed up and loaded into cars etc. There had been pies and cakes there for dessert after the meal and there were a few left. Bob F asked people to take one home with them. One of the ones that was left was one of my favorite desserts so I said I would take that one. We were having a conversation as we worked, about family health issues. I told Bob F that about three years ago my doctor had told me I was borderline diabetic, but I hadn't discussed it with him any further because I refuse to be diabetic. I decided to just make more changes toward living healthier. As I was saying this I realized that I shouldn't be taking that dessert home with me, and I could tell by the look on Bob F's face that he was thinking the same thing. I was feeling torn because I felt that I had been doing very well about living healthy, except for the holidays, and that it was okay to eat what I want occasionally.
