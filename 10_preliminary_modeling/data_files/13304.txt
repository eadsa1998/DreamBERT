I was at this pool place with the school. Calvin and I went to a place under this bridge and it was small and full of bugs. There was a time for the pool. Sometimes it was water, sometimes lava, sometimes there was nothing there. The lava was actually milk with some food on top. Earlier there had been a train ride and it would go over the walls and all. It was pretty scary. Mom went on too. I saw a poster for The Kingdom and it had Jason Bateman on it.
