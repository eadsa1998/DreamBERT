The police took Mom's pickup and Hyundai. She and Darren came to Dad's in this old Toyota car. We drove off and then I got out chasing a ball. Mom came back to where I was. A while later, Ezra and I were in the lounge room. These bad guys that had held up Captain Spaulding (House of 1000 Corpses) walked in and asked where Mom's pickup was. We said "Out the back" and he walked back out the front and said "I'll be back in a sec". So I closed and locked the doors. A few minutes later they left and we went into the office. They had taken my monitor, which was worth $2000. We ended up in Cash Converters at Northlands and they were there. They drove off and we went in and found out that they had hocked it for $500. The guy behind the counter said we couldn't have it because we couldn't prove it was ours.
