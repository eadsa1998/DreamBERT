 I'm on Eagle Lake in a boat with others. I'm navigating. I go off my normal route and am lost. I pull out my enlarged Eagle Lake map to see where I am. I can tell I'm west of where I want to be. The motor stalls, and we can't get it started. There is no pressure in the ball for the gas can hose. The hose is loosely connected. We take off the hose and replace it with a smaller, shorter, narrower, more colorful hose. There are two packages that need to be flown out. I try to tie some kind of air-structure to a model of the plane. We are controlling the plane by radio control. My friend Matt Yams helps me.
