I dreamed about my family and I went back to Vietnam (my native country) for a visit. When we tired to get on the plane to go back to the U.S., the government officials told us we can't do that. So now we are stuck. How are we going to start our lives all over again? This is such a terrible situation. We will never get back what we have in the U.S.
