I was on my way to the library to do research. I had a baby with me. I kept reminding myself that I could have him for 2 hours, but not to worry because I could have him again another day. I went into a public restroom because I had to go pee. I kept saying, "It's o.k., this isn't a dream. This is really a bathroom." It was crowded and dirty. Finally, I left. Another woman was with me. We started dancing down the carpeted ramp. I was wearing black high heels and hit them rhythmically on the walls, etc. as part of the dance. At the bottom of the ramp, I bumped into a man that was walking by because I couldn't stop in time. He laughed and joined in, sort of.
