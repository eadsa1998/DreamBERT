My cousin Sebastian and his wife are expected at family reunion. They arrive. Then I am happy to see them. We must go somewhere (a store perhaps) to get something. We are up in mountains. We go to the store. We take our animals with us. I have an affectionate, cute pig. I go to the back room in the building with Sebastian, his wife, the pig and the dog. The owners are a family. Warmth. Some kind of difficulty over the well being of pig is taken care of.
