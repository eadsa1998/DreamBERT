["Teaching the man to take care of his baby."]  I am on a high mountain top. People are there, each group sitting or lying on a cot. One man and his baby lie in a cot. I go over to help him take better care of the baby, who is crying. I put some drops of milk on his nipple and place the baby there for feeding. The baby hungrily nurses. Then I pick up the baby. I see his cute face and dark black hair. He is wearing a plastic sack up to his armpits. At the bottom of the sack is milk he had drunk. I hug him and pat him. He is happy. Now it is necessary for all of us to leave the mountain top and go down the mountain. It is snow and ice and we struggle. We get to a sheltered spot around a big rock when I realize the people we had counted on to be there weren't going to show up. Bad people were coming close and we had to make the rest of the difficult journey alone without help. It is difficult, but we make it. Now we are at an outdoor fair where people sell their merchandise in booths and in old motel rooms. I walk from one to the other looking at the wares, but not interested in any of them. Some strange man, a bad politician is around.
