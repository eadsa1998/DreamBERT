I saw an insect with wings. I recognized it as one that later would shed the wings and become a worm that was harmful to plants. It looked like a katydid. I ran my fingernail across the scales of its belly, and its stomach opened. I tossed it into a garbage can. This was the first time I had seen one that had wings.
