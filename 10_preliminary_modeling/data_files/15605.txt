I looked on the Comic-Con site and Adam Baldwin had cancelled but Nathan Fillion was replacing him and I was really excited. But the next day he cancelled. Then I woke up and it had been a dream. I checked the Comic-Con site and Adam Baldwin had cancelled and I was annoyed. [I woke up in a panic and had to check the site -- all was good].
