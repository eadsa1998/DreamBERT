["Baseball talent."] I am a young and healthy woman. I stand in a room and wait for the men's baseball team coach to enter. When he does I try to pitch a ball at a large TV. I have a powerful wind up but the ball is squishy and I can't get a good grip, so the pitch is mushy and ineffective. I try 3 times. He's laughing at me. Then a young woman is holding a ball. I take it from her and smile, saying You know a good ball when you see one. It is hard and regulation sized. I pitch it at the TV and the throw is so powerful I smash it to bits. This grabs the attention of the coach. I apologize for throwing at the TV. I say I should have known better. I ask the coach if I can be on the men's team. He laughs at the very idea. He is however impressed with my power and skill. I go to the park and try to join the team. They won't accept me, but they can't help but acknowledge my talent. I slowly win them over. I remain cheerful in the face of their derision and booing.
