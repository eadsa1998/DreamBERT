I'm in a house with '60's decor. Green shag carpet, etc. My family was trying to sell this house. There was a slimy used-car salesman type guy with his blonde girlfriend. She was very hippie-like. We went into a room with a huge indoor swimming pool. I was sitting on the ledge and she jumped in. Andy (my brother) was there just observing. I jumped in after her and kept grabbing her hair and trying to drown her.
