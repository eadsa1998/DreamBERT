I was in this house that wasn't mine. A man was there talking to his wife. His wife was in the shower. The man was tall, medium build, dark hair and tanned skin. As he and I were talking, I began to kiss him on the neck. He kept talking but I could tell he was enjoying it and perhaps flustered by what I was doing not knowing what to do or say. I stopped for a moment and he turned to look at me. He still didn't say anything about what I was doing. He turned away again and began talking about something else. Then I began kissing his chin. He turned and kissed me on the lips briefly.
