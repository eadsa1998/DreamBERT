I was on a cruise and it was summer. A waiter, Brandon, always brought me ice cream. Suddenly everybody started getting sick and dying, so I decided to leave the boat before I died. I swam for a long time, and I got to this island with nothing but fruit trees. I lived there for a while, but I was lonely although I was otherwise happy. Then a rescue plane came and took me home. Setting: First on a huge boat, then on an island, then in a plane, then home. Characters: I didn't know any people except a waiter on the boat who always brought me ice cream. His name was Brandon. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, lonely. The cruise might have been because I have been wanting to go on a cruise with my friend in the summer. We're trying to plan it.
