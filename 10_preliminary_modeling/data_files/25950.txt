 I'm at a school. It is a different kind of school. The students seem younger than I. I shouldn't be here because I'm not learning anything. I have trouble finding my classes. There is a strict class schedule. The five minutes between classes is not enough for me. Someone says I should be in my coworker Jerry Parson's class. I fumble around and look, and am late for class. Through an open door I go into a classroom where the female teacher is demanding the one correct answer from a boy. I yell at the teacher ferociously! I tell her that she is wrong! There isn't only one correct answer. I am very firm and clear in my speaking.
