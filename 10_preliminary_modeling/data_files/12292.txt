I was at school and it was Year 11. My timetable sucked. I had no S+E until next semester, but I had cooking first though it turned out that cooking meant Phys. Ed. This meant seven periods of Phys. Ed. a week. I refused to go and requested that it be changed. At some place someone was using a car or a bus as a plane.
