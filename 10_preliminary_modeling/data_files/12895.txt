I was on an excursion and I saw Eugene in the line. Madelyn and I were walking home. She lived near Mom's. We went down Beach Road towards Centerville. She lived on a street called Algiers or something. I remembered driving down it before with Mom. I ended up at this guarded place. Autumn was in there. They used it for experiments. There was a big shop/Timezone thing. We could play and take anything we wanted. There was a game where you throw spaghetti at the wall. Mom came and I managed to grab some chocolates. Autumn was asking us to tell her who liked her.
