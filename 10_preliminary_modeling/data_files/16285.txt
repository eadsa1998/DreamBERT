There was this lady, one of my teachers, I guess -- who had this box of CD's and she wanted me to go through them and pick out a few of them that I wanted. So I went through them and they all looked kind of blah except for these two. They were both done by Celine Dion. One was called "The Little Green Captains" and it was like a real cartoony cover. But I had the notion that it was one of Celine Dion's first albums, so I picked that one out. And there was another called "The Swedes" -- you know, like people from Sweden, the Swedes. And it was the soundtrack to a musical where Celine Dion was the main girl in it, and it was done kind of like in opera except it was sung with regular voices and not operatic voices. And here's how the story line basically went: there was this girl who lived in this big house and she was sick and tired of being a servant. And that's the girl that Celine Dion played. And her two sisters were kind of competing to marry this rich guy, and one of the sisters died and one of the sisters found somebody else. And the rich guy was kind of left hanging, and the servant girl ended up marrying the rich guy and got out of being a servant, which is what she wanted. And there were, this CD, this story was told in songs on this CD. And I had this like baby CD player in my closet that I was playing this CD on, and it was light blue and it had like red buttons on it. And it was like for babies. And I'm in my closet listening to this, with my door closed, and Mom needed me to come downstairs for something, and then I woke up. But that was kind of cool. You know, maybe she will play in a movie. Singers who like go and act, I think they kind of get distracted from their singing. So it's good that she never tried to act.
