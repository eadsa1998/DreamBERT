I am in this huge auditorium and it is a celebration for our college graduation. However, everyone there is from my high school for a reunion to celebrate college graduation. Everyone was there. It was so big. Gwen (my best friend from high school) wasn't there, however. I remember sitting on my knees and I was wearing a tight skirt and it was pulled up so my underwear showed. Then a well-known TV host pulled it down and I wasn't embarrassed at all. Then at the front of the auditorium they were doing little skits and they called me down for one, but I didn't want to do it. Then someone told me it was a skit about the 60's and if you do it, you get a bong hit, so I did it. It was weird. I stood in line and when it got to be my turn, I walked up to this desk and signed a piece of paper that this boy gave me to sign. Then I went to get my bong hit. The bong was being passed around, so I walked around and saw so many people from my graduating class. Finally I found the bong and my friend came over with me. I asked him for a lighter and he gave it to me, but I couldn't get it to work at all, so I ended up having to use matches.
