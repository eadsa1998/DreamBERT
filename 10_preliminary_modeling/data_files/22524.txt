I dreamt I was at the university and a car race was going to take place in which my boyfriend was going to participate. I saw clearly how he got his small red car ready. The car was all made of plastic and, therefore, I was afraid for him to race, but he was decided to race regardless of my opinion. We discussed it a long time until he had to go because the race was going to start. When he was racing, I felt so afraid that I had to go away and not see any more because I was very nervous. The dream ends here. I awoke and looked at my watch and saw that it was 5:25 a.m. I kept thinking a good while about the dream I had had, and then I went to sleep again and dreamt the following one.
