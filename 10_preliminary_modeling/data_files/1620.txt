I come into a room where the teacher is speaking. I see a baby on a blanket and speak softly to her. The teacher is angry and tells me to just go to my room and recite Hamlet ("To be or not to be?") I get angry at her and tell her she's wrong and too harsh. I have my classmates as witnesses and she'll get in trouble. She cowers angrily. Then my classmates and I get to our dormitory room which has beautiful spacious pieces of antiques and ritzy furniture. It's a big open space and each girl's space is marked by her furniture.
