I was using an air pistol and a lady asked me if it shot and broke windows. I said it was too weak. We shot it a while, then Bob and I played marbles. We shot steel bearings with our hands hitting them. Joe Gruber called me to go into a booth. The number was 33 or 32. I ran. I had a hard time finding it. There were numbers all over.
