I am standing outside on the sidewalk near my mailboxes near my condo, several neighbors are there, all male, there's one that I recognize and another 3 that I don't. I talk to them to ask them if they're interested in having some of my rolled up pennies that I have in rolls of 50, to see if there are any valuable coins among them. One of them expresses interest and I give him a roll, I ask them to give me the 50 cents, but they don't do it and another man goes "Oh!" and I wake up.
