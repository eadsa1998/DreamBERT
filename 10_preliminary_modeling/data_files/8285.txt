It was winter. I was in a parking lot and the cars were covered with a couple of inches of snow. I saw Doctor W. I was maybe 1000 feet away from him. I wanted to quickly get my car cleaned off and leave before he saw me or could approach me and talk to me. I didn't get done in time. He saw me and headed towards me. I think I got in my car anyway. He said he wanted to talk to me and I told him that I really didn't have anything to say to him. It seems that this happened twice before I got away but I'm not sure how that could be.
