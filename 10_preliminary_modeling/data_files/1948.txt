A group of people are out in a field. They are sheep and have collectively decided to band together to attack the wolf. I see one woman in the center whose two strands of hair droop down over her face like two antennae of a bee. She steps forward and leads the group. As a group they approach the wolf. Then I see a bear and then a panther. Then the group goes back toward the house. Now I'm in the house with my new/young husband. I am feeling caring. He has a rash on his arm, maybe poison oak from out in the field. I hesitate to touch him because I don't want the rash, but I've already touched him, so what the heck. I see a bandage with Doctor's name on it like it's the prescription. He goes back to bed. I stay up and start organizing papers and books, old ones left for a time in a sack, letters from my daughters, old appointment book (red). I get hungry and go to see what's in the cupboards: potato chips and oatmeal. I decide on oatmeal and remember a bowl already made in a cupboard in the bedroom my husband (Howard) went to. I pass a stove with boiling water. I ask if it's fresh. A woman carrying a tiny baby says, "Sort of. It's for checking out some kind of animal organism or bacteria." It looked like it had soap in it. I decide at the last second not to eat this old and icky dish of oatmeal. Paulina wants to babysit the baby. I look at it. It is very tiny and newborn. I ask how old it is and receive the impression that she'd just had it a few moments before. I don't think Paulina should handle such a small and fragile baby.
