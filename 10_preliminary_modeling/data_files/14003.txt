I had to collect kittens from this giant red dog. We had to crawl inside it and it had walls. If we touched the walls with this electronic stuff we would get -2 points. Each kitten was worth 1 point and we needed 6 points to pass. It was dark inside the dog. Then I was outside and there was this forest area with these metal drums with dark, murky water in them, with snakes in them. We had to reach in to grab them. There was another area with animals surrounded by fences. There were dogs and there was this really pretty pony. This guy came and I don't think I was supposed to be there.
