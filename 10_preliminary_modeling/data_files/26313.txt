 I'm driving in a carload of people who seem to be like my family. We drive on a dirt road through a wooded area with sparse houses. The houses are large, but not tall. The people who live in the houses are very rich. There are many species of animals, which I've never seen before, grazing and sitting in groups on different parts of these lawns. Among the animals, which are all mixed and interbred species, are jackalopes. We arrive at a sandy area where we'll take a ferry across some water with our vehicle. There is another vehicle there. We are divided into two groups to go on the ferry. One group is called Apollo____, and the other that I'm in is called ___ ___ ___ (I forget these names). There is then snow on the ground. Something happens with a mother and son in an old, big house.
