Frank is in another city and I call him L/D on a pay phone: "I'm hurt, but I am OK" he says. He had been in some accident. Then I see a doctor wearing blue fatigues sitting opposite me with a sculpture of a woman's face that WALLY had made sitting on a table next to me; I ask "What time is it?" The doctor takes off his watch and places it underneath the cloth that covers the sculpture, and speaks as though his voice were coming from the sculptured head. (sort of like a ventriloquist); He tells me the time and kisses me on my left cheek.
