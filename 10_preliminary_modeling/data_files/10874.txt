I was skating on the outdoor ice pond that used to be across the street from my house. I was not alone, but I did not recognize any of the other people who were skating around. I went through my whole repertoire of jumps, spires, and steps-some of which I can do and some of which I'm not yet sure of. They were all executed flawlessly-some I repeated, some I did only once. I seemed to know that if I went into competition, I would be sure of coming in third because there were only three contestants. Up to that time I hadn't considered it because I hadn't thought I was good enough, but now since everything was going so well, I decided to enter.
