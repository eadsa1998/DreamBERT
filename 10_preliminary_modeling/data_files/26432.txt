 There is a race. Many men from my old neighborhood are involved. There is a consolidation of debt, so that many familiar men all square up their debts. I know all these men from interactions in and around the Oak Valley community. Among the men are my acquaintances Walt Thompson and Mike Bautsch. Something may happen with dogs, and the race. I'm in the rafters of a dark garage with a person I know who is my age. We hide, and stay very still. A family looks for us. I have my legs hanging down, and think it will be easy for them to see me. They don't see me. I hold still for a bit, and then make a noise, calling out. They find where I am, with some difficulty. They pull a ladder over at my request, and I step onto it to get down. I then move the ladder so the person I'm with can get down. For me to reveal our location was defeating the purpose of our hiding. I say I was just tired of hiding. There is some kind of challenge with steps, and I have not undergone all the steps. I have one step or a portion of a step left. It is getting late, starting to be night. Something happens with men carrying guns. There is a house or houses that need to be secured. The men with guns pose a threat, and they are not checked. Something happens regarding leadership.
