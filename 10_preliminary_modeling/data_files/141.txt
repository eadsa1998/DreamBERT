Somewhere, in a place like the Administrative Wing, there's an office like Mr Slaughter's or Jan's - beyond it is an open space. All the walls and panels are a medium dark peach. The lighting is indirect and down some. Seems like night. I'm looking into this "office" - which is bigger than usual - and there's a large incubator-type thing in it. I can see it has something alive and furry in it so I go look. There are actually 3 human babies in it, all asleep, and 3 huge guinea pigs, and some large hamsters. Somebody has told me to go look at the hamsters, but didn't mention the babies. I consider that odd. It seems to be some kind of experiment.I'm in a house with a young girl. I'm visiting, I don't know anybody here very well. Seems like she has a younger sister. We are going somewhere, and next door stop at a little house with bushes out front that have candy bars on them. She's looking over one and I see she's got a Violet Crumble in her hand. I'm delighted and start looking for one of my own. I'm listening to a girl whine at me, everything's wrong with her and her life, etc. As she turns to me, I see a crystal. I guess she'd been wearing it but I see it separately. It's clear but has green inside it and another color outside - maybe part of the setting, another stone. It has a silver cap on it.
