There was a boy, Alan Allah. There was an old Indian legend about him. He was riding in the backseat with his parent; his parent put their hand over his face, crushing Allah's temples with thumb and fingers. The parent pushed their hand into Allah's eye sockets (with) thumb and 4th finger, shaking him till he was dead. His face had been clawed off. Old Indian legend told the story of Allah's death. They say all over the woods you can hear the screams of Allah's ghost moaning, "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah." 7 times. Dora was in the back seat too. She heard the screams. When she tried to climb out of the window she dropped her schoolbooks. When I got out of the door to pick them up for her Jack was left in the driver's seat, on the right, and he had never driven a car before. The car started rolling into the creek until Dora saved the day. Homer was making a funny joke about Christian Scientists. The Bible prophecy said the tree would grow with boards nailed in different directions.
