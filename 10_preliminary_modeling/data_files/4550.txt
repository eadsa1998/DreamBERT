["Loving Mel Gibson."] I am living in a beautiful spacious house. Mel Gibson comes by. He and I are instantly attracted to each other. As we walk from room to room, we are flirting as we talk about how we could change and improve the rooms. My "mother" is around somewhere, disapproving, wanting me to give up Mel Gibson. We walk out to a back porch, then to a room out in the back yard. He lies down on a couch and I laugh because he put on a pink woman's nightgown and is batting his eyes at me invitingly. I take on the male role and seduce him. He is very excited. It is fun to do. Now we have somehow built a long and complicated wood boardwalk on stilts. I have a room that is near the end of it. The police are looking for Mel Gibson now. He is hiding. I am waiting, hoping he will return.
