I dreamed I was at a wake. My boyfriend's father had died and his wife cried a lot, as well as the rest of the people at the wake. The strange thing is that I was dressed in strict mourning clothing, but I wasn't near the rest of them; I was farther away. They didn't see me, but I could see them and I thought that it was much better for him to have died because he wasn't a good father or a good husband, and that nobody should cry but, on the contrary, rejoice that he was dead and would no longer be with them. Besides, in my dream I thought that the dead man was looking at us and that he was repenting for all that he had made his family suffer, but that he could not communicate with anybody and was sorry about this. I was happy that he felt sadness and remorse and that he wasn't able to ask forgiveness because he was suffering and his suffering gladdened me. Then I don't remember what else I dreamed, but I know I had a long dream, though I don't remember it.
