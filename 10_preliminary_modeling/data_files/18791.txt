I and the boy I had gone to spend Thanksgiving with had gone fishing and were standing on a dock apparently at the Castaways. I didn't actually recognize the area, but I remember hearing two people talking about how long it had been since they had been to the Castaways docks. We were standing there looking into the water when this gentleman and this young lady came up and they were the ones who mentioned that it had been such a long time since they had been down there to the Castaways and seen the water and the boats.
