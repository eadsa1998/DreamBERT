I had kind of a crazy dream. This is all I can remember of it though. I was on this boat and it was kind of like a big sailing ship, and I was kind of stepping out on deck with this musician type of guy who was playing the guitar. And he had a guitar amp sitting on board. And he was playing some big easy bayou stuff and I was dancing and singing with him. And we were just having a blast. And then I kind of was walking around the deck and looking down into the water, and I saw it really black along the edges. And then this man got real serious and I realized that he was Dad, and we had to, he said that the wind was dying down and he was going to have to turn on the motor for ______, and all of a sudden I realized that we were in a real small boat, and I sort of jumped down and started swimming. And I realized that there were these big shells and these chocolate chips on the bottom of the ocean, and I was having a chocolate chips of the sea snack. And then I was swimming because I didn't want to be there when the motor started, and I realized that they were five feet behind me now, and I woke up.
