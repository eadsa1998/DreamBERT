I read a bit of The Liar and it was really good. Some spy lady had to go into this computer but it was then me with Eugene and the others. It was taking a long time to download the stuff and the people came back (one of them was Jeremiah) but I managed to print out some stuff. This teacher caught us and Eugene told me to go back and he'd give himself in.
