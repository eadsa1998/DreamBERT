 I'm in a place which may be Goldenshire Golf Course in Oak Valley. I'm with a group of friends and my brother Wally. I think my friend Queen Billman is there. My friends say to Wally that either he has to leave or they are going to leave. I say that is pretty mean of them. I leave and go home. I get into the house and see that the parking lights on my truck are on. I have to go out and jiggle the light switch in the truck to shut them off. My jacket and shorts with my wallet in them are in the bathroom, and they fall into the bathtub and get wet while water is draining out of the tub. I carry them and a bunch of other items up to my room. My room is very clean. The light on the ceiling of my room doesn't work: the bulbs must be burned out. I use my little lamp on my bed. Wally has devised some system or score to demonstrate that he wasn't being mean, when people told him to leave.
