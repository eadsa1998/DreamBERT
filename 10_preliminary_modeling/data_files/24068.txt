I'm in a house that's totally white like a hospital, but designed the way a house of the future would look like. I hear some doctors saying that they're about to administer the "easy" medication to my mom because she's going crazy or something. Now I'm running through the neighborhood of white houses. I keep running and running, jumping through the air and traveling really far. I'm bounding through the air, doing flips and back-handsprings, but I keep running. I'm holding a mop and use it to pole vault over walls and to aid in more acrobatic maneuvers. As I keep running, I begin to hear music, a sort of rock anthem, and soon enough, I find myself in the house I started in. I do a back flip and land on my back and am about to do a kick-up when on the ceiling I see a mirror and in the mirror is a cartoon woman (sort of looking like Louis from Family Guy). The figure starts to morph into all these different women I don't recognize and as the music gets louder, the figure in the mirror looks more and more like my mom. And as the song ends, I hear the doctors say, "Time to administer the intermediate medication." Then I wake up.
