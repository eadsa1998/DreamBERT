I was in this park, very large park similar to Greynolds Park, a large park that had a beach and I guess maybe a restaurant, a forest and so on. I was with 2 other friends -- one who I know, David, a friend from real life and the other I don't know. I don't remember. We were walking through the park and then I realized that we were there to kill this lion, I think, or tiger, that was loose and supposedly very dangerous. We were carrying a rifle. So we were walking with the rifle and all of a sudden I kind of got scared. I thought, "Gee, I'm carrying the rifle--that means I have to shoot at it!" Then I remembered that I wasn't too good a shot, and besides I was kind of scared. So my friend David said, "Well, let's see. Let's see if I can hit that tree," and he shot at it and he hit it, the edge of it, and then I shot at it and hit it squarely in the center. So I was given back the gun and I was the one that was going to shoot, and then we started walking into the woods. I was awakened.
