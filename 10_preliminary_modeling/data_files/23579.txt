Outside there is a flower stand with beautiful bouquets of wildflowers. Many purple and pink flowers. There are a couple of women standing. A straw basket filled with rolled pairs of socks is in front of the flower stand. I began to throw the socks up into the air. It is sunny and I hear guitar and flute music from Bach.
