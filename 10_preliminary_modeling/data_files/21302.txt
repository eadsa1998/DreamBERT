I was sort of investing my money in newspapers. I was buying them and reselling them and I was making money. A profit. The next day I was doing this a friend of mine wanted to help me by putting down the investment money and share the profit with me. I agreed. I was looking at the race results. I saw one horse that paid $125.00, but I can't recall the names now. I was in the woodwork building. I was sort of lost in the departments. I was watching something up high, looking up. Captain Blood came to me as I lay in bed.
