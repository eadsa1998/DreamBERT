In my dream I am sleeping next to my girlfriend when she starts talking in her sleep. I lean over to wake her up and I realize that I went to bed alone and that I am dreaming the whole scenario. I get excited because I realize I can control the dream. I look over at the alarm clock and the time is way later than it should be. I wake up to my alarm going off.
