I dreamed that I was in a place like the C-- M-- Stadium. It was the day that a "Beauty Queen" for W-- R-- was to be chosen. The name was to be announced at the middle of the football game. When the time came for the announcement, everyone was silent. The name was read and it was my name. I called out that I was here, but my voice wasn't heard--not even by the person next to me. I tried to run down to the football field but the faster I ran, the further I was from the field. While I was trying to get down to the field they chose someone else who was very beautiful. She looked like the girl who was chosen for R--'s "Homecoming Queen."
