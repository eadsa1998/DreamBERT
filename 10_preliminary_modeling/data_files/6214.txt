I went to the music store that I always go to in Wilmington. This time though, it looked much different. It looked like a sporting goods store I had been in years ago, which had a wooden, cabin-like exterior. The proprietor, who is one of the nicest guys I've ever met, was there, but I don't know if we talked. He was busy with some paperwork behind the desk. Meanwhile, I was going through a large selection of sheet music, which was in plain cardboard boxes. Also in the boxes were some pieces of cake and some other things like muffins and cookies. I had a piece or two, but started eating them secretly so the guy wouldn't see me. They didn't taste that good.
