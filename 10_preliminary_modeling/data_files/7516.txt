Mary and I are in a large building that seems to be a hospital. Mary is confined to bed and undergoing tests. She calls me into her room and sadly, tearfully, tells me the test results are positive -- that the disease/ cancer has returned -- or was not destroyed by her treatment. Both of us cry and cry with sorrow and disappointment. There are other people in the dream, and other things are happening, but I can't remember any of these details. In my sorrow and anger I am provoked into trying to do something about this, but I don't know what I am trying to do -- am able to do -- other than cry and yell. Mary asks me why I am dressed so nicely. She seems annoyed by this, but I'm not sure what her annoyance with me is all about. I think I try to explain why I am dressed so well, and I think Mary is angry that she is ill and I am dressed up.
