Eugene, Darius, Bradley, two others and I had had photo taken for getting a good score on a test thing. Ezra was there and was annoying me. Later, the photo was in the paper and on the news. Eugene, Bradley and someone had been the only people in the world to get 31% on a SIDE test when they were 3 years old. I was feeling proud of Eugene. I was near Ms Pascal's office and looking at the board, which had a bunch of photos on it. They had Eugene and I wanted them. I was in two of the photos, but one of them had a hole where my face would be and the other had a pin in it. I was about to take them when I saw Ms Pascal staring at me from the top of the stairs with a weird look on her face. She came down and I said that I love photos. She said "obviously you like someone in them". There was a picture of the country with black kids there too.
