Jane C was working for a membership organization. I was having a discussion with her and some other people and she was implying that the members of her organization were lower class than other similar organizations. To help make her point she picked up a bottle and said, See, American Roadhouse. The bottle was some type of condiment from a table, such as in a diner. I knew what she meant but I didn't know exactly what was in the bottle. I continued to think about it and then realized American Roadhouse probably made three such offerings. Ketchup, Steak Sauces, and Bar-B-Que Sauce. I don't think we were actually at a diner though, because it seemed that we were at an office, at a computer, talking about software or entering the members into the computer. But it also seems that we had started with a discussion about members' needs. That is why Jane said what she did - to make a point that her members were happy with less than in many similar organizations.
