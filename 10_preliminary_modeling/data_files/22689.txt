My boyfriend had invited me to the beach. We were swimming and, I don't know why, we came out running and left. I think we went to his house. Then I saw myself in a mansion where everybody was dressed elegantly, and I was shivering because I was wearing a two-piece yellow swimsuit. Then I was walking through some corridors and rooms, looking for my boyfriend so that he would take me home, and I found his mother, who told me she would lend me a sweater. I stayed in a little room that looked like a library (because the walls were full of books) waiting for her. The shelves were made of dark wood, and in the center there was a table, round, and with the top covered with green felt. When I was trying to find a book to read, my boyfriend came in dressed in a dinner jacket, and he laughed at my appearance. Then I started to cry desperately and he, who was always so sweet, was not moved, and did not try to calm me down. Instead, he told me to wait, that he was going to come and get me to take me home, but before that he had to attend to the guests. He did not want to tell me what the occasion was for the reception. I remained alone and I waited and waited, until I was tired, and I looked for something with which to cover myself because I was terribly cold in that little room. I tried to tear off the green felt, but it turned into shreds and didn't help. I was bored and I hurriedly got out through the window. It was raining and I felt that my bones were wet.
