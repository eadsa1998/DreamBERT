I was at my first job as a trainee supervisor and it was supposed to just be me and Esther on the early shift. However, when I arrived (it was at Hillary's btw and was different), Niles and Sergio were there. At one point Esther said something about me not eating pork and when she said it again later I asked her why and she said that Niles had told her I didn't eat pork. I was annoyed that he was spreading rumours about me.
