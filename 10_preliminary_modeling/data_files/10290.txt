I am walking toward MORRIS and CHRISTIE'S (my favorite grocery store owned by a church member) I see FIRE ENGINES and lots of SMOKE. I ask if it is M &amp; C? "No, it is the small shop next door." The shop is all black and the old man who owned it is badly burned. Lots of gossip about the old man: did he bring the dolls from Germany, or from the Nazies or was he a Nazi himself? I don't feel sorry for him. I go back home....
