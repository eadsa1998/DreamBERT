 I'm in woods. There is a fox there that has a bow and arrow. He shoots his arrows into trees. He shoots the arrows where the tree forks into branches. He'll fire three or four arrows and then the tree will crack and fall, splitting where the arrows were lodged. I wonder how he can do this. Then the fox shows me. Actually, he has rocks with bombs inside. He has strings tied onto the rocks. He'll throw the rocks and they'll hit or get lodged in a tree, and then the bomb will explode, splitting the tree apart.
