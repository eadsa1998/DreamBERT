My girlfriend had gone to a spiritual retreat and a friend of hers, a very trusted friend, told her that she had seen me dancing cheek to cheek at a party she had gone to with other girls, which, in fact, was true. The friend told her this as a favor rather than as gossip, which was worse. When I got to my girlfriend's house, she was very angry and asked me to explain. I talked a great deal and was able to convince her that I hadn't done it in any but a normal manner, which cost me a great deal of effort.
