I was walking with another man and I was carrying a little boy. We came to my house, and as I started to enter, he asked me if I would walk with him to his house. As I reflected on his request, I felt a titillating sensation in my solar plexus. I agreed to go with him. Later when I went into my house, strange people were there. The door was open. I was afraid we had been evicted.
