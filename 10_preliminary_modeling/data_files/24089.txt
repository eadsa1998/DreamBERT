I am in the bathroom of my apartment and there about four pairs of glasses on the sink counter. One of the pairs of glasses is mine and as I go to grab them, I accidentally knock all the glasses right into the toilet. I think that I reached in and pulled them out, but I am not sure. I know that I wasn't too upset about the whole thing. I was like, "Oh well, just another stupid mistake."
