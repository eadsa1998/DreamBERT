I was at home and Circe was over. She asked me to do something like give a warning before I did something or whatever. I agreed. Tristan also said Frederick had taken one of his condoms and I asked why and he said 'some joke with Dolores'. Then I saw Dolores was over and she was sitting on a lounge and giggling on her phone. I saw she was talking to Frederick and I lost it and started screaming at her saying 'STOP TALKING TO HIM!'. Then I woke up within the dream. I told Tristan I dreamt that I screamed at Dolores. Later Circe, Tristan and Frederick were walking in a line through the house and Dolores was at the end. I started feeling angry immediately and I said 'Tristan, I'm getting angry' and he said that he could tell. And I said 'no I mean get her out of here now'. She started going, confused, and said something like 'as long as Frederick's friendship is true' and I screamed 'it's not! The same thing happened to me!' And she kind of ran out the house and I followed her, crying and screaming and was saying 'it's not your fault, it's Frederick's!' And she was like 'I don't know what the problem is' and I said 'he slept with me and then treated me like a stranger' and she stopped and turned around and asked why it mattered. I said 'it was my first time, he was my closest friend. Now he doesn't talk to me and he's doing the same thing with you' she asked 'do you like him like 'Facebook like' him?' And I said no and then she was cheerful and skipped away. I was upset because I assumed this meant she liked him and where things were going. I went back inside and Frederick was lying on the floor talking to Tristan. He asked me a question and I poured this jug of water at him. Then I threw a glass bowl at him. It didn't smash properly. He got up and was trying to calm me down and I kept throwing glass things and heavy things at him.
