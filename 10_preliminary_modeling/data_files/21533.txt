I picked and heard Ray Dsoher. I saw a list of entries for a special race. I won a lot of money from sister Ann. I went to the track and played a horse to win and place. I loaded him and another that was an entry I played to win. First the entry was scratched, then put on the board separate and I can't recall the names, but it was pp. 10 and was 202 to 1 odds. The race went off. I saw the horses go by below, then when they came by us, they were human beings running instead of the horses or they changed to humans. They had pp numbers on their backs. There were also some women.
