I was in a car with Dad. Someone chased us. Then we went to this place for the finale of Lost. We had to go underwater and there was a cave thing with steps and a big screen. I sat down but realized I'd forgotten my bag. I went out and got it as Ezra came in. It went for 2.5 hours. Jack (Lost) was speaking to a webcam and making faces.
