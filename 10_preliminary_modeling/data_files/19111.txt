The only thing I can recall is something to do with boats. There were several boats on the smaller lake, and either I was counting them off for Calvin and telling him, or he was counting them out loud. I don't remember what kind of boats they were, but he was interested in them and this counting was going on. Just before this it seemed as if there were some other kind of counting, or tallying going on, but I'm not sure about what it involved.
