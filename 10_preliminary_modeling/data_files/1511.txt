A cat hopped out of the refridge when I opened it. I say, "How did he get in there?" I notice Aunt Elaine left a bunch of miniature glass knickknacks out on the counter. I start to put them back in the cupboard. I see a movie video on the wall. It's a man floating in raging muddy waters and talking like a travelogue monologue.
