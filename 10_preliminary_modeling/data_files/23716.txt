Traveling in an old car, like Robert P's '61 Mercedes.  I meet or know a girl.  We are to travel together.  We go to a wilderness area - there's a rocky hill back up off the road.  Looks like Utah, Arizona.  I meet her friends who were in a different car.  (Carved like a toy car, bright pink.)  One man and I start to really like each other, but we have to be careful because this man used to see my girl friend, who's around.  This man and I go up to the base of that hill and talk and kiss.  This man is young, long haired, bohemian.  I don't feel like it is a potential permanent relationship, just enjoying the attraction.  We do lots of stuff, can't remember, some interaction with other people in group on trip.  We go to the trunk to get something.  I had packed all my stuff in there.  There was a huge squash, pumpkin in color and taste, but crookneck in shape, in the truck on my stuff and I was afraid it would leak and rot all over.  Some of the people scoop some squash out of the middle to eat.  I try to cover my things with plastic, under the squash, but the people don't care and it's heavy.  I realize that there's no way my girl friend would not know I had been seeing her (ex?) boyfriend.  It is so obvious.  The area in this dream was specific, like we knew there was a small old town nearby, but I'm not sure where it was.
