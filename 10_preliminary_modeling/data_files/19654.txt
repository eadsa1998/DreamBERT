I am walking or trotting along a path or sidewalk, hurrying to reach a certain town which is a suburb of London. It is still dark (I wish to reach my destination by sun-up) and I can't see the ground clearly enough to avoid the occasional puddles of water. I meet a boy, 8 or 10 years old, and stop to talk with him. He says he has seen me before and remembers especially the big lens on my camera. He says, "I'll bet you are not bothered by poor light." Someone then tells me I have now reached the town.
