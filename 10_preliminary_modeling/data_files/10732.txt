I dreamt that my front teeth were loose and wobbled. Then I thought that I was chewing something hard. I spit what I was chewing into my hand and looked at it. My hand was full of blood and teeth. My mouth felt sore and swollen and I spit out what was in it. Again I saw the blood and teeth, but immediately my mouth felt full of hard bits again. I kept spitting and trying to get rid of the feeling, but it wouldn't stop. I was getting panicky and it seemed very real. I went in the bathroom and tried to drink some water, but immediately I had to spit and I couldn't drink. I became so frightened finally that I woke myself up.
