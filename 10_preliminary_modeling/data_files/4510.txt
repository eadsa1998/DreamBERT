["Ginny helps me travel."] I am packing to go to Dover for a while. I will be staying at a friend's apartment. I think the person's name is Kathy. Ginny is with me. She is going to fly the small plane we will be traveling in. I find the keys for her. She refuses them, annoyed with me. I am confused because I thought she'd need them. The key to the airplane and the key to the apartment. I continue trying to pack.
