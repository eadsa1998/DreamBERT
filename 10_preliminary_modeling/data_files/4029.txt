["Floods, and saving the baby"]  I am in a dingy room in a basement of an apartment house. Ellie is there and so is a baby. The baby needs something and I go to get Ellie who is sitting like she is comatose near the kitchen. I see the dishwasher and start to do the dishes. But suddenly, a whoosh of water wells up, and spills out over the floor. I am pushed out the door of the apartment by the force of the water and more is coming. I run to escape the flood. Down a long dark hall I run. I go up to another higher floor and search for people to get help. I see a door open and go into some office with odd looking phones. Two men are working there. I say I need to call for help. They vaguely notice me but don't do anything. I try to use a phone but can't figure out the complex button system. I scream at one man "You son of a bitch." I yell at the back of the other man, get the fuck out of my way. He is shocked and jumps quickly out of my way. I race back down the hall. I must return and save the baby and Ellie. I find a tiny wooden box with metal wires and pipes in it hanging on the wall. This is an elevator. Two other woman accompany me.  You have to hang on with your hands on the metal pipe. But three women is too much weight and the small box speeds it's  way to the basement. We hit hard, but are all right. I run back down the hall, the water increasing in depth until I get to the apartment. It's up around my thighs  at that time. I force my way in and go get the baby, finding Ellie and forcing her awake.
