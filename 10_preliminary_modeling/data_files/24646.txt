My mom and my dad were going to some place and me and my brother were going to some place you could drive to. I guess my brother was driving, and my rats were loose in the back seat. I didn't know, but we had to stay over that night in this place and I didn't know where to put the rats. When we got to a restaurant, I opened my door and my rat ran out and over to the piano. She started playing and she was very good. Finally I got her and my other rat, into the car. We had brought this food bowl thing with a cover and I though we should put the rats there, but Brian, my brother, didn't. Then I woke up. Setting: At a restaurant, my real house, and on the road while we were driving. Characters: Me, my brother, my mom, my dad, lots of people at the restaurant that were clapping for my rat when she played so good on the piano. Feelings and Thoughts: Angry. I don't really know. But I was angry when I was fighting with my brother, Brian, about where to put the rats. P.S. I watched a movie the day before and it was about a kid who played the piano. And I was playing with the rats a lot yesterday. Also, in the movie the kid played at a restaurant. He just walked in and played (like my rat did).
