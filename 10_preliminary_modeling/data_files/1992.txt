Now I'm a doctor and I come at my shift. The other doctor says, "We've got that cranky patient. He wants an operation. He wants to remove some of his intestines to make room for some extra organs, like maybe a kidney." I say, "Which organ does he want?" The other doctor says, "Oh, he's not sure yet." I say, "What does he think, this is a multiple-choice organs?" Now the surgery is being done to me for him. The nurse says, "Good. You are dilated," meaning my blood vessels in my stomach area. I feel it. Later, after the surgery, I walk slowly into recovery room. I take the soft, cushioned chair of the other doctor who also is recovering. He protests, so I move. Someone wheels him near me, teasing. I say, "Don't you know we can't stand each other? Take him away." Bill Cosby as a doctor is in there somewhere.
