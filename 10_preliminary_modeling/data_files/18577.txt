I was designing an annual report, only it was covering many years of my life. The headlines were red (Section 1), blue (Section 2) and yellow (Section 3) (most recent) in Trade Gothic Bold Italic, 72 pt. (try ex. bd. ital alt., 10 pt. trade gothic bold) 100% K. These tables, designed beautifully, were about my screw-ups in life. There were many. There was a stack--scattered--of photos of Dora--years worth of me and Dora together. The empty stack place was missed photo opportunities when I was screwing up bad. It was COLD. I got a coffee on 7th St. and went to the gallery. I needed clean socks. Marianna told me there was a pillowcase full. A plastic bag hanging there looked extra heavy and the weight of the bag was as if it were filled with mercury--but very heavy plastic bag of carbon powder in there--the bag was--the consistency of very heavy, very fine granulated into near dust, powder. It kept the bag from moving. I saw a sign for flip flops and though I was in a hurry, I vowed to myself (that) I'd get some.
