["Charla Falls"]  I and two other people are walking down a series of corridors. I think we are pretending to be Star Trek characters. I am at the end of the line. I feel scared because I am vulnerable and someone or thing might jump out and attack me. I comment to the others I don't like being the one on the end. It's too dangerous. We turn a corner and come to a mezzanine level area. I look over the railing to the floor far down below. I feel scared I might fall. Suddenly I see Charla fall over the rail and I rush to the edge to see if she is all right. She lies crumpled up on the floor, the video camera she was holding, under her. People rush to her to check out if she is OK. They hand her up to my level to show me she is all right. She is curled up, still unconscious. Then there is a deli counter between us. A woman says sarcastically that I will give up and not stay to watch her, because of the deli counter in the way. I am angry at her. As I try to go to the right side of the counter, I discover that the counter goes along the entire edge of the railing. I can't get to Charla to confirm she is all right.
