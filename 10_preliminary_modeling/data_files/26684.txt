 There are a number of dresser-like drawers enclosed in a glass structure. People are around it. I see this and may be there. Some drawers can be opened and/or removed, while others can't be. We need something in the drawers. A boy is sent to crawl through the maze-like glass casing surrounding the drawers. It's a tight squeeze for him. He's going to get a small item: maybe a key. He needs to avoid being seen by the teacher, by certain individuals. When the female teacher or others are there, the boy is riding a bicycle. He is naked, but has a shirt and pair of baggy shorts draped over his naked body as he rides the bicycle. The kid jokes sarcastically about making and selling a light blue shower curtain. A woman there says that it's a good idea. He does make shower curtains, and makes money! Later, there is a celebration. Fish is or has been cooked. It burns, and the room is smoky. A man tells me how the fish came to be burned.
