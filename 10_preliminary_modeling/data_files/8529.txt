I had told someone that I couldn't do something they wanted me to do because I was taking care of someone. It seems that it was someone I knew, a friend, but I can't identify him. He was in a bed that was very high - a bit higher than my waist. I lifted the blankets and his shirt a bit and gently placed my hand on his stomach, just rubbing his stomach ever so slowly and gently. He relaxed a bit and said that eased some of the discomfort. My dad used to do that when I was a little girl and sick. Later I'm working in a special care unit of a health care facility, caring for quite a few people with cancer. One of the things I was doing was to provide them with cool compresses that seemed to ease their discomfort.
