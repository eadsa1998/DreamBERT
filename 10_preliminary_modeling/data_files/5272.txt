I dreamed that Sue and I were in a car together. Isabel called our Spain program to see if she got in. They said she had. So then I called to ask if I got in, and they said I hadn't, but that there was a program in Russia if I was interested. For some reason if I wanted to go to Russia, I had to learn Latin, which wouldn't have been so bad. I remember telling myself that this was a dream and waking myself up.
