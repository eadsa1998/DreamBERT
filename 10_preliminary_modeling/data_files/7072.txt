Walking along the upper verandah with J. He turns in at toilet saying, "you won't listen?" I say no and walk along the wing at right angles. At its end I see a partly built staircase leading up to the roof. I didn't know there was a third story. I must go up the stairs but won't try it just now. I return and tell them about the stairs. They too hadn't known of it. ... Start to do dishes. I gather up boxes of silverware saying, "I suppose we should polish these." "No." and I put the silver back ... Now I turn to ironing and wrap up bundles as I sprinkle, unrolling some to wet a piece more ... Then they come to hang up the wash.
