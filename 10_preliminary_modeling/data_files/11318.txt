I was going to do combat with someone. In my dream my opponent and I wore armor as in knighthood days. Nothing about this seemed strange to me or my older sister who was looking on. We were both on a horse and my foe had a long lance readied. I was lacking something and wanted to get it to be prepared. I was afraid to forestall the battle to search for I thought I would be seen as a coward. I felt I could easily win the match but was bothered by not being fully prepared.
