I was watching my sister's baby while she and her husband went out. I went up the stairs to see if little Cathy was alright when a Negro jumped out of the next bedroom and tried to pick Cathy up. I kept hitting him and started to scream when he stabbed me. He jumped out of the window and started running down the street. I looked down at my side and blood was pouring out. I ran down the stairs and outside, when all the people in the block ran over with a sick look on their faces. I told them to get Cathy and then I fainted. When I came around, I was in the hospital and the doctor told me I was going to die. I started to cry out loud and that's all I can remember.
