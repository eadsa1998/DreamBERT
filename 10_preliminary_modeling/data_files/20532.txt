I was in a hospital dormitory. I was in a bed, and a female patient was in one at the foot of mine. Later I was discharged, and I was afraid the female patient would tell someone about my being in the hospital. I went into a store and saw an officer from the hospital behind the counter. I knew that he was not a salesman, but a disguised house detective. I kept out of his sight so he could not tell the others about my being in the hospital. Later I was stripped from the waist up and I was exercising. I reflected that I did not have the opportunity to exercise my chest in the hospital. My chest became very protruding, almost like a woman's breast.
