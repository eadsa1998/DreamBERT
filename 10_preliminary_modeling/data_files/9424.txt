In an airplane, being catapulted into the air very steep ascent; someone who does not know how to fly a plane; rough weather, but land safely. Shift: I am invited by some people I do not know very well who live in a very beautiful modern home. I start to tell them of my conflicts and ambivalence between intellectual life and feminine life, but talk of something else; "I will tell you all this when I know you better."
