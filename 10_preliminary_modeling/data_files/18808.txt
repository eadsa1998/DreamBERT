I was in a co-ed boarding school or college by the edge of the sea. Many of the classes were outside. I remember one in which about 50 of us were all on one big rock next to the water. I cannot remember the subject of the class, however. We had some classes inside also. In one, I remember, I had an assignment to deliver a short talk on the value of the education I was getting at the school and how it differed from other schools. I did a very poor job preparing, but I was sure I would not be called. As it turned out the professor (female) stopped just one person before me. For this class we were in a large room somewhat like a cafeteria. In the corner I was sitting in there were some strange foods which had just been brought in for dinner. I remember one was mastodon meat. After that class we had one outside on the rocks. I left early and did not clean up the things I was working with, but someone else did it for me. After this I remember being tired and wanting to lie down on one of the ceremonial couches, but I didn't. Two girls were lying on these, however.
