I was watching Gossip Girl. Blair and Serena went missing. Serena had gone missing first and her parents asked me if I knew where she went and I said I didn't know. When Blair went missing, her parents asked me as well. They asked Blair and she said she didn't know, but then she left and went missing. Dorota helped me look. Someone asked me something at one point and I pointed to the parents. Then I was at school somewhere and this guy was doing a talk. He marked my name and then I had to go to the next class. He told me to wait. I was annoyed because I wanted to get a good seat. Eugene went in and I sat on a seat up the back. He had shaved his hair. He had hairy feet and I took a photo. The talk was about some disease from some hot thing on walls.
