I was standing on the bank of a small pond in which a very small yacht was located. The water was only waist deep and a boy of 20 that belongs to the young people's group I do was running through the water toward the boat. His clothes were blue. I walked along the bank and up the gangplank into the cabin. There was a mist in front of my eyes. I said, for I knew he was in there, I bet I know something. He said, what? I said, you're all wet. He said, guess again. Then I saw him smiling, stretched out on a couch with a cocky officer's cap and a light blue turtleneck tee shirt and blue dungarees. They were dry and not the same ones he had on before. I just stood there and the dream was over. His arms were folded behind his head. I had had several dates with him and he had walked me home from several of our Sunday evening meetings.
