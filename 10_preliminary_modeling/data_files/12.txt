I arrive at a little frame house on a nice little residential street, in a car in the company of a couple of older women. It's been raining and might rain again. It's dark but not necessarily night. We go into the house, which belongs to another nice little old lady. We have an errand there and ought to get back somewhere pretty soon. Seems to me we're all a trifle edgy about something, but not all of us know what about. Like the lady of the house here - she knows something's not right, but isn't asking for explanation.
