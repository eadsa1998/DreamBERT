The most recent dream is of me and my fiancee getting out of a very nice car, dressed very nicely. We are walking together holding hands, laughing and smiling. We walk into the building, have a seat and the next thing I see is a young boy, on stage. He's cute... performing in the play. He looks as if he's age 6. We watch the play and video tape the play. The next thing I know, he's our son. I woke up as soon as I heard his name being called, the same as my fiancee's, but with the 'III' after it.
