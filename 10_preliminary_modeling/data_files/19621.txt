Driving my car along one of the old curving roads of the Mall in the vicinity of Smithsonian Bldg. Presently, I walk into the New National Museum Bldg., through a small office somewhere on the side or back (apparently it is Sunday and main entrance is closed). There is a girl operator sitting at the telephone switchboard. I jump up on to counter, vault across, and enter a large room through a door at back of office. The men's room seems to be my objective. The I am making same try a second time, but on this occasion I fail in attempt to jump up on to counter, because floor is waxed and slippery and my foot slips each time just as I jump. Failing to negotiate the counter, I go through a wooden, swinging gate at left end of counter. As I enter the large room this time I see Mr. Hanes with a large screwdriver, either opening or closing a wooden packing box. His attitude seems to be somewhat truculent and unfriendly as he asks, "Have you asked the ....." (?janitor). Not wishing to start an argument I answer "yes" though I know there is no need to say anything, as I have a perfect right to be here, and Mr. Hanes is merely being a meddlesome busy-body in challenging me. This time I see Mrs. Hanes walking across one end of room. When I reach the man's room I find the lame boy (Nat. Mus. messenger) wandering from toilet to toilet, apparently trying to find a clean one. I now notice that the seats are badly spattered. I step up to a urinal when I suddenly discover that all the urinals have been removed.
