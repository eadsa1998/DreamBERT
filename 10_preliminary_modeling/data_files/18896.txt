In this dream I was in downtown Miami in my car. I was driving on Flagler Street toward the Boulevard. As I was driving, I saw a large Bengal tiger in the street. He came for my car and leaped up on the side of it. I remember closing my windows to keep him out. I was quite scared. Finally he left my car and went someplace else. I think the reason that I went downtown was to watch a parade because I went down to a parking lot by Bayfront Park and could hardly find a space to park, it was so crowded. I remember leaving my car and going over and joining a large crowd on the sidewalk. I was conscious of the fact that the tiger might be around. Then I did see him again, but this time he didn't appear to be so ferocious. He wasn't after anyone. Finally I left, just before everyone else left, because I wanted to get my car out before the traffic jam. I remember I got my car out first and started home again. I was relieved because I didn't see the tiger again.
