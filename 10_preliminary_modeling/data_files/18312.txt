Traveling. Late at night, back and forth on a sort of freeway, but on a tram-like thing which you gave verbal directions to over a speaker and which then carried you. I, some girl, and a Negro man were on this one. When we got off, I and the Negro man embraced ; at any rate, I felt very warm toward him.
