I was swimming in a lake and noticed the water level was going down fast. The lake drained out entirely and I saw creepy white crustacean and fish crawling around on the new exposed surface. I thought, "Ugh. I was swimming around with those ugly things?" Some were that white that denotes never sees the light of day, like maggots.
