Heard a mother talking to a child. She came with a two year old. I asked him about his bath and showed him my large doll with very long clothes. Turned up its skirts so he could see its feet. He was playing with toys about the large room. I suggest him building a block track for his train. He goes to get the long blocks to build the track.
