My friend Paul and I were at a convenience store. These two guys came into the store. There was an argument between them and us. Outside the car one of the guys came up to my window and started screaming and waving a gun. I took off with Paul and they chased us. After a couple of minutes into the chase I got a flat tire. Paul and I said that if we split up it would be harder for them to chase us. I ended up running to the fire station where my father was working that night. He took me up to the third floor. All of a sudden we both saw one of the men trying to get at us from outside as he was trying to get in through the window. Once he got into the room I ran right into him causing him to fall right through the window. I thought I had killed him, but I looked out the window. He had only fallen into a hedge that was out on the second floor. As my father and I looked over he was pulling out a gun. I ducked and my father was one second short of ducking and ended up getting hit in his right side of his ribs. I picked my father up on my shoulders and carried him throughout the fire station. I was very aggravated because of what had happened so I hid my father in the fire station, got an axe off of the fire truck and went looking for this person. As I was retracing my tracks the stupid phone rang -- woke.
