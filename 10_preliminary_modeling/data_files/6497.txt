I dreamt I was going to meet Frank at the Green City Movie Theater for a movie. But I got stuck at the Hillside Library trying to find a copy of Steinbeck's book, Sea of Cortez, in a really cheap edition put out from someone's typewriter and facsimile machine. Came time to go--20 minutes past my shift's end. I ran down to Hillside and boarded two enormous German Shepherd dogs. This was a really archaic form of transportation, apparently, like caveman-transportation. I rode on the back of one until it got tired and then I switched. These dogs didn't know me too well, though, so I got a lot of bites and scratches.
