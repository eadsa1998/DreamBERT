[1997-07-01] I was a candidate for the witness protection program and I dreamed that I was being relocated to California. I was extremely upset and sobbing hysterically because of the thought of never seeing friends or family again. The morning of the day that I was supposed to leave, for some reason I was up, stripping beds. I could feel the sheets in my hands, once I bent down and touched a bare mattress. But then I paused and realized that I didn't even know what was expected of me, why was I stripping beds? I don't even know what I am supposed to be bringing with me.
