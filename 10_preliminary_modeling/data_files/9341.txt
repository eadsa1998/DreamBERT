I'm with Carl Sagan in Japan in a bay where soldiers drowned in coming back from a victory in Korea over Mongolian Ghengis Kahn-Kublai Khan. The oysters had the face of Japanese warriors on them. When the fishermen raised oysters with face of warrior on them, it was like desecrating a graveyard. So each one with shell that resembled a warrior put back. As the years have continued since 1300, the resemblance to warrior has moved closer and closer. Sagan in his TV show said this was Darwinian selection where Men and Nature were together. In my dream, a scientist said volcanoes erupted at same time. So face like cameo of eroding layers of pink, brown, and mauve volcanic dust to give that effect. Most of the scientists in the bay argued against him. He lost.
