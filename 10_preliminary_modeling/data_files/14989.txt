Mom, Ezra and I went to this place to get food. We were eating in the car. It was nice but obviously fattening. Later, I found out it was snake penis, balls and something else. Ezra said something like "It would be cool to see David Lynch to [something I can't read]". I opened the car door and vomited. He recorded it. Later he gave some of the food to Mom and she liked it. Then I was watching a behind the scenes of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Kaitlin Olson was making up some dance. Rob McElhenney was singing a song badly. Later, Ezra and Kim did this thing where they would randomly run. I followed them and they went through houses and yards. They jumped over fences, went through cat doors and jumped on stuff. I fell behind and lost them. I walked along a path and didn't know how to get back. This Italian guy tried to help me. Rover was around at some point. It got to 5.30pm and my driving instructor hadn't come.
