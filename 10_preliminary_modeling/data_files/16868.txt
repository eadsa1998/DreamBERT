I'm at home - in the dream 'home' is the top flat in a tower block. There isn't much space, and what space there is, is full of stuff and people. I'm busy trying to make coffee, when old band mate Jack turns up. He comes to discuss something - a planned meeting that I've forgotten about. I sit him down on the roof terrace and go back to making coffee, but I keep getting distracted by kids and other stuff, until I forget about Jack. Eventually I remember he is still there, and when I go up to the roof, he is half asleep, waiting patiently, but slightly hurt by my inattention.
