I am in a VW bus and I am following a man who is ahead of me and on foot. He starts wading across a shallow, wide river that has lots of algae growing in it. As I drive in, I feel concern and say, "Is this too deep?" He smiles and walks on. I continue to follow. It's up to my radiator but so far so good. Now I see trees, and two tree trunks are walking like each one is a foot and leg up to the thigh. I am amazed. Then I stop, get out and go up to some trees to talk with them. They are gentle, listening spirits. I get across the river and put down the luggage and the baby. I have to go find the airport. I walk and now I'm lost, and then I see airplanes taking off and know I'm close to the airport. I see a huge wall and a woman and myself climb it. It is hard and we have to grab silly ceramic things for hand-holds. We get to the top and look over with great disappointment - no airport, just farm land. It's like we had climbed a bulletin board of an airport and looked behind it. We go back down, talking about how hard it was and how tired we were and how disappointed. At the base of the wall stands my mother, Aunt Millie and cousin Sonja. I wonder how I'm supposed to get the bags and the baby, and who is taking care of the baby? I must have put her in a day care center in the city. I wouldn't have just left her at the river's edge, would I? There are lots of highways and attempts to get to the city.
