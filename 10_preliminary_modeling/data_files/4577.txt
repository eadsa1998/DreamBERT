["Dancing in the prison."] I am in a large room in a prison, waiting for the condemned convict to be walked past this place. I want to see him. The guards walk with him. I am now in a lower room, looking up through high windows. The convict throws a ball down. A guard tosses it back to him. He throws it again. I catch it and underhand back to him. This game continues for awhile. Then they walk him past me. It's sort of like watching a movie star go by. I think to myself, don't get attracted, he's obviously not the right kind of guy. Then I am watching as a dance routine of teenagers is described. They form the small case letter h with their standing bodies. It is very cute. I decide to create the letter w, with me in the center, in a manual wheelchair popping wheelies and prancing around. Ellie is impressed with my wheelchair dancing skills.
