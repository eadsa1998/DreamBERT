I was covering an event at a zoo in a small village-like location. I was talking to someone who was eager to talk to me about how much he liked the zoo. I was off talking to someone, then I saw the guy I was talking to earlier being hosed down or something by the park manager. He was on all fours, getting decontaminated.  He climbed the fence. I went over and the director didn't want to talk to me. I went over to the embarrassed guest and just started asking questions in a joking way. He responded, then, BOOM. Two p-51s collide in midair, sending wreckage flying across the area, setting fire to buildings. I said to him -- god, news -- I'll be right back. I ran out into the middle of the town square. I had my phone in my hand -- I was dialing the newspaper where I interned. Then a huge chunk of wreckage came down on the tower and a chunk flew off and fell on top of me. I thought "this is it -- it's finally caught up to me" but I was able to run free, although the falling chunk of airplane parts damaged my hearing a little. I ran off -- and saw the guy who climbed the fence taking pictures. I said -- can we use those later -- you will be in the newspaper where I interned. He said yeah and continued on. Nesmith came up and asked if I was ok. I said yeah, and she sniffed inside my ear -- she was a former military operative or something -- and could tell some ashes had hurt me. Next I come back and the place is being looted by vandals on brute choppers. I start shooting at them. I take one and swing it around by a chain like Mario. Then a helicopter comes in with their leaders. I attached the centripetally-risen bike to the helicopter and they fly off. The radio station. Magic sees this and announces, "whoever did that gets a magic wand" I consider calling in. but I go in and it's a party in someone's house. I shower in the bathroom with sightlines and the 1-way mirror in front. I wonder if anyone can see.
