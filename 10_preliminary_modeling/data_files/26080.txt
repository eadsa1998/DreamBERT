 I'm in Wilmerton on Roundabout Way at the intersection with Friends Ave, which I know is 15th Street, by Scott Junior High. A black man is there. He is going to Hawaii and needs a ride to the airport. My friend Bubba Hacker is there. He and I argue over the directions we are going to give this man on how to get to the airport. Bubba wants to direct him down 19th Avenue, even though there are a lot of stop signs, and actually because there are a lot of stop signs, because he has concerns about the man's driving ability. The man takes a taxi. My advisor Mary Monroe is there. She is the director or boss. My friend Nat Miller is on the side of the road, waiting in a yellow cab. Several people are in the cab with him. He is getting off work, or getting easy work, since he gets to drive the cab. I may be his co-worker. I tell the man it's going to take at least 1.5 hours to get to the airport, which may not be enough time for him since he indicates he needs to be there in 10 minutes. I'm on a school bus with Mary, my friend Norman Noman, and others. A large man asks a question about "When would be the best time to...?" I cut him off and say, "Now". He was either asking the best time to eat at Dairy Queen or the best time to go to the bathroom. In either case, the answer is now. We all get out of the bus. It costs $3.33 for three Blizzards at Dairy Queen, and one gets a free Blizzard as well, so Norman and I decide to do this and each eat two Blizzards. He gets Heath flavor as his first one and tells the worker to put a lot of Heath in it. I'm getting Heath flavor for one of my two Blizzards as well.
