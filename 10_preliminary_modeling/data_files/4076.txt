["Flying Dolphins Cathedral Grapes"]  I am in a house. I think my brother Dwight lives there also. I notice it is raining very hard. I walk over to a window to see the downpour when I am suddenly aware of the courtyard and how beautiful it is. A canopy of grape vines like a cathedral ceiling. I look to see if there are grapes. Big nice ones, some so big they look like electric light bulbs. What abundance I had with me and I never noticed before. Then I look higher to see two transparent glass like dolphins leaping and arching over the top of this grape vine structure. They are so graceful and beautiful. I go back into the house. A woman stands right in front of me and opens her dress completely like it was a robe. I stare at her naked fat body and then turn my eyes away. I am repulsed by her fatness. She is grinning at me. Then she has underwear on. She closes her dress and is inspecting all the things in the house. Some General is around and wants to know. I show her Dwight's room. I am uppity and joke around about being a spy. I don't like their attitudes. Now a young man is talking to Dwight who is soaking in a pool. He explains he deliberately let the demons out to hunt Dwight and he's really sorry. Dwight smiles, not concerned.
