I was trying to get some documents to print properly. I spent more than an hour trying to figure that out. I woke up from the dream at 4 am and then went back to sleep, the dream continued. I woke up from the dream again at 5 am and still had not been successful getting the documents to print. There aren't a lot of images and so not much to record. No characters. Don't really see a setting. I see the settings on the printer and I see the copies coming out wrong.
