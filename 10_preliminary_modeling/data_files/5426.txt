Last night I first had a dream that I was kidnapped and being held hostage in the woods. Our cell phones wouldn't work, and the people who had kidnapped us had taken our kayaks and paddles. My next dream was that I was playing hockey with my women's club team, but something was wrong, like one of the girls wasn't allowed to play. Then I was in the dining hall and I think Michelle had died because I kept crying every time I tried to eat. Then I was on an Outing Club trip with Jessica, Kim, Sydney, and Abigail. Rem and Kat and left behind all our spandex, so we were really embarrassed that we had nothing appropriate to wear. Alec tried to help us find them, which didn't make it all any less embarrassing. But then I think in the end we all went snowshoeing.
