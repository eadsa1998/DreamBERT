 I'm by a large mall or office-like building. It seems to be like the Middle Mall in Wilmerton. I'm on a large, cement second story balcony. I slip off it, but catch myself and pull myself up. I see a deer down below me. It looks like a white tail buck with a decent-sized set of antlers. There are many deer there. The ones with antlers have antlers that curve back in a semicircle, to a point. Someone says they are Wisconsin Caribou. Grandpa Redding is there talking of hunting. I walk though the building to get out, with some family. We go through a shop that sells gifts from Australia. There is the leaning Tower of Pisa, and a photograph of the family is taken on it.
