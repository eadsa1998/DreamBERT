I was at a warehouse like place. I needed to go somewhere and Dad, Poppa and I left in a van. They had to drive it a weird way and no-one knew how to drive it. Poppa sat on the roof. I said "what about Matt Frewer?" because he was back at the warehouse. So we went back and got him. Other people came with us. I was then at a shop, which was Mom's. I accidentally brought a hat through those things that beep to warn when someone hasn't paid for something, and it beeped and a security guard came and I said "I work here" and he made me fill out a form about what had happened. I was on my laptop and it was going slow. Silas was there. There was a quiz and he had Leon as one of his favourite movies. There was a girl, who was sometimes my daughter, who broke her leg. I was thinking if I had a boy I would make the middle name Edward, because it was Michael Palin's middle name. I was then at school and there was an obstacle course. Sometimes it was at home. There were ten swings and a slide in the way. I was digging underground and there were rabbits, rats and guinea pigs. I asked Nana for garden gloves and they were made from a bra, and so had a squishy thumb. There were some Asian people there. This lady was asleep in Dad's bed. I was looking for something and Hungry Like the Wolf was playing and this girl turned it off and I kicked her out of my room.
