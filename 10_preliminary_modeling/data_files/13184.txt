Autumn was playing Pokemon and it was lagging heaps because the internet was slow. I was at her house. Her father was supposed to pick up Dad. She disappeared and returned minutes or hours later. She was at a table and then she went to the toilet. Dad was watching Boston Legal and I watched a little bit because James Spader was in it.
