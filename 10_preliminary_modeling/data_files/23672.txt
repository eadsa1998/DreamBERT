My sister (the middle one) was in a weird mood - childish.  She was being mean to me, so while she was on the phone, I went to bed.  She came in (this takes place in our childhood home) and started teasing me with a brown puppet.  "Now be careful," she said, "this is made of chocolate."  I reached over the covers and hit that puppet as hard as I could.  "Uh!  Be careful," she said.  I would not respond the way she wanted and she turned to leave. But then she turned and came back for more.  She did not see Mom come in the room then.  My sister was jabbing me and poking me with a fork.  I was cowering by then, because she was really hurting me.  I tried to scream, glad that Mom was finally there.  I got this little squeak out and it woke me up.
