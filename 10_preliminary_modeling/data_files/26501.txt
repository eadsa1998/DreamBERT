 I'm at a hotel, where I see my psychology professor Jordan Clemens dressed in hi usual "smart casual" attire standing outside below my window. I seem to be on the rooftop area. My classmate Alan is there, with his friend who is really drunk. There are other psychology students at the hotel. There is a cat near me. I take my flannel shirt and snap it at the cat, to shoo it away or scare it. The cat jumps towards me. I duck, and it lands on my back. I feel it cling to my back near my neck. The cat may be going to the Dominican Republic. Alan's friend may be going there too. Something seems to happen in a farm-like setting, that involves blood or medical supplies.
