I was watching a 'behind-the-scenes' thing for Queer as Folk. Denise Black, Scott Lowell and Craig Kelly were in it. Denise Black was like 'don't even let me better than this man' and pointed to Craig Kelly (I think that's what it says, it's hard to read). She was going through this list which had them all ranked in attractiveness. Scott laughed that she was last.
