I ran all the way home, facing traffic, along a busy street lined with trees, dodging in and out among the trunks and branches, pretending I was catching passes, evading tacklers, etc.  My neighborhood was almost labyrinthine, with  very narrow streets, and very colorful and modern.  The house where I lived with Mother and Daddy was quite large and roomy, with carpeting everywhere, and much wood paneling.  It was dark, and Mother and Daddy were in bed asleep.
