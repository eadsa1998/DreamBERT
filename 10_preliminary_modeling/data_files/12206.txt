Jayson came to Red Rooster, where I worked. Samantha and Silas were outside. Jayson was talking to me and he was saying that he wasn't going to be back again, and that's why he was here, to say goodbye to Ezra. He said he was going with this under-21 gay thing. I was like "What the flip?" He said "Oh yeah, you don't know I'm gay. And I was like "What the flip?" again. He also told Mom and then Ezra. We were all shocked that he was gay.
