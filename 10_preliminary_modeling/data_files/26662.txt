 I'm back from Australia. I seem to be near the Uptown Mall. I see my uncle Rusty Redding and his kids Melvin, Rich, and Melissa. I go up to them, and give Rusty a hug. I talk to Melvin a little bit. I say hi to Melvin and Melissa, and then Rich, pausing before I say hi to Rich as if I have forgotten to say hi to him. I'm in the large bedroom upstairs at home in Oak Valley. My sister Heather is in the closet. I knock and enter. She is curled up in a sleeping position. I ask if she's okay, and I tell her I want to talk to see how she is. She opens up emotionally: I go in and we talk.
