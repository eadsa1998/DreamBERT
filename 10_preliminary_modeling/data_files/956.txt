Shannon and I go on a vacation, just like last time. We get into a VW bug. She starts to drive. We stop at a restaurant to use the rest room. We carry our cats in. I have a Jay cat (a cousin of mine). She has Mama cat. Jay cat looks up at me, and asks if Papa cat is coming on the trip, I say, "No, but Mama cat is. We'll have a good time." Then I point out my new "jivin'" hair cut. I choose to drive the rest of the way to give Shannon a rest. I carry the suit cases. I think maybe we'll take a different route this time. I think of Tennessee. [BL]
