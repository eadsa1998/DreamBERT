Co-Worker-F-03 was supervising a job that was considered 'high up'. I can't remember what kind of store it was, though I had thoughts of Kathmandu. At the end of the job, I was somewhere else with someone and they called and said if I got back in 10 minutes they would make me a 'chief supervisor' - allowing me to potentially supervise the job in the future and being a trusted stocktaker with them. I got back and then we left. Later some people were filling out a sheet and I didn't see my name in the 'chief supervisor' bit, so he started writing it in (in chalk), but then I noticed it was already there and they scribbled it out. Later, I was on a job that Hugo was supervising (just us two). Mom had dropped me off and when she saw Hugo she gave me a look, but I put my head down so as to not egg her on [she has been making creepy suggestions lately]. It was a clothes store, but it was like a section of a bigger store and no manager was around. He had scanned a rail, and gave me a box that was underneath. We were messing around a bit and I was giggling a lot. When we got to the end, there was a bunch of other stuff from other stores and I had to check it wasn't from this one (there were some wedding dresses, as well as like porcelain type of decorations). Then I noticed cleaners in the hallway. The lights were all off too. It was early in the morning, before the store had opened and we suddenly had to be out. Another girl was then with us. We fast walked through the shadows - I noticed Hugo wasn't carrying any equipment except his two guns and I asked if he had any equipment and he said no - and were almost at the exit when someone spotted us, and we kept moving and went into the men's toilet and out a backdoor into the carpark. Then it went into third person view and showed the person walking after us as we all got in the car and drove off.
