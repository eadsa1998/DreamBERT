I go to M City and get lost because it's changed. I see some buildings near the college I recognize. Then I see how the city has grown. I am at an intersection on the hill and see a fast current in a large body of water. I think, "What a lovely view; someone should build a house here." Just then a train, huge and noisy, rushes close by. "Oh," I say, "I see now why no one builds here." I see lots of trains and nearly get run over by one. I veer off and see a slough. I am walking with a man and I call out to warn him that sloughs can be dangerous like quicksand, but not as bad because it doesn't suck you all the way under. I also remember about Abner and catching frogs and our promise to marry when we grew up. We go around the slough to the house.
