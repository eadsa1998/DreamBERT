["Moving to another house."] I moved into a new house. I rented it furnished. I notice the TV is small and old. I ask Bonnie who is helping me move to bring my 32" TV from my bedroom and my other TV as well. She agrees to help. I walk outside to check out the neighborhood. I see a restaurant where I can eat pancakes and syrup. As I come out I see it is next door to the public library (which looks like the Old MM City library.) I am very happy about this. I walk a few more blocks to find the street I turn left on to get to my new house. I try to see the street sign in order to remember what the street name is called. I am remembering how to get back to my house when I leave it.
