I don't remember where I was, except that I must have been in a rather small room. I was in an argument with one of my fraternity brothers. Somehow he fired an air rifle (I did not see him. I just knew he had fired it.) and I received a hole in my eyelid which I thought extended some distance into my head. I made quite a commotion of this to whomever was standing around. Next, I was waiting for a bus at a place where I had often waited in the past. There were two other men with me but I do not know who they were. The hole in my eyelid was still there.
