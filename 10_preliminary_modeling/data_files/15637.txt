I was with this guy who was very serious, but hot, in his 30s/40s. He was like a bounty hunter. We were looking for The Hound (Game of Thrones), who had been captured. We found a grave that said 'The Hound' on it, but we thought it was a lie. There was a water park and we had to go down a slide to reach another part of it.
