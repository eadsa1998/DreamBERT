 I'm at home. We seem to be hosting a party or gathering. Grandma and Grandpa Redding and two of my mom's aunts or uncles arrive in an old-fashioned Model-T-like car. They enter, and we greet them. They have driven all the way from Farmington in the cold in this car! Grandma is unstable: she nearly falls over when I greet and kiss her. I feel guilty because I almost knocked her over.
