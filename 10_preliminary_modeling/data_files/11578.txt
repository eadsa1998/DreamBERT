I was out in a heavy rainstorm at night. I was wearing a sou'wester hat and an army raincoat. I must have had boots on, for my feet were not wet. The area I was in was not built up, although there were streets and sidewalks. I was experiencing a deep feeling of sympathy for the people who were not clothed for the weather as I was.
