["Bathing Grandma Maude"] I am working on a project with my computer. I have lots of work to do. I am worried about how the files will transfer from the old style to the new. I am in an office, like at a college. I am distracted by other people needing my attention. Apparently Grandma Maude is very old and fragile and needs a bath. I am distracted but interrupt my work to give her a shower. It is hot. We walk into another room, like a separate cabin. I turn on the shower head on the wall. There is no shower stall or curtain. I pull up a stool for her to sit on. She walks in, naked and not as old or fragile as I thought. I tell her to sit on the stool but she sits on the floor, her legs folded in a lotus position. I am amazed she is so flexible. Her hair is long and flowing, dark with streaks of grey. I shower her and spray myself, even though I am clothed, as it is so hot. Now the shower is done. My mother is on her knees on a couch, singing "I wonder if I have been abused." Over and over. I am a little annoyed at her and also glad because if she is willing to ask questions and check things out, then maybe I'll finally find out if I've been abused.
