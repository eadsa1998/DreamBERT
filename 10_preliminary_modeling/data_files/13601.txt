I was somewhere in the car with Dad. There were all these llama signs everywhere. There was a costume house. Calvin told me about these green shorts. The shop was gay and people 'jumped' on the car. Ezra was there. We went to a friend for something. We were young and with this girl. I was then not there, and was replaced by Elisha Cuthbert. The friend, who was a guy, did something and told Mom to leave and he said he wasn't going to do anything to me. Later, she met with this girl and got something off her.
