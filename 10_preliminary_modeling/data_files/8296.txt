I was at SVH but not as a patient or an employee. I don't know why I was there but I was with someone. We ran into Doctor B. He spoke very briefly with the person that I was with and did little more than acknowledge me. I was a little confused, hurt, or disappointed by that. It seemed unusual because Doctor C often said that Doctor B spoke highly of me. Later I was by myself and ran into Doctor C. I was surprised to see him. I said, What are you doing here? It's Thursday afternoon. You should be golfing. He said, I know. He was not as upset as I expected him to be with working on a Thursday afternoon instead of golfing. He did say something about not being happy about it. There was also something about the sleep center staff. We weren't actually at the sleep center but maybe some or all of the staff were at the hospital in a meeting or training room for something going on there.
