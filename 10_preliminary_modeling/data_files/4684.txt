I am watching as a mass murderer sits in a room. A woman is very curious and sits next to him. She asks him questions, like tell me about your gruesomest murder. He says OK, but you have to make an oval shape in front of you as I talk. She does that like she has a "mouse" made of soapstone and she traces an oval shape over and over. As she does that another woman comes in and sits and watches. Now I am doing the shape as yet another woman comes in. The perspective of the dream ego change in a circle.
