My radio alarm was going off. As I was listening to it play I was also working with or viewing the files I was receiving via the radio. There were different types of files. Some of them were images. I was looking at the different types of files. There was something specific about the image files that I was looking at, that included what extension they had. if they were tif's, jpg's or something else. The files were related to some kind of event and I had an agenda for the event. The files somehow correlated to the different segments of the agenda. I was moving the files around to make sure they were each associated with the right segment of the agenda. I think, at least at one point, I was talking to someone else. The time on one segment of the agenda said it began at 6:30. I suggested we change that to 6:45 because we would need to allow time for a change in the room setup before that segment. I wondered what we would do with everyone for that 15 minutes, where we would send them while the room setup was changed. I thought that people had done something similar for weddings and just sent everyone into a large hallway for that time and had refreshments out there for them while they waited. I realized I was going to need all these files on my computer and wondered how I was going to be able to transfer them from the radio to the computer. At first I didn't think it could be done but then I realized that it could. and how it could. So I relaxed and kept working.
