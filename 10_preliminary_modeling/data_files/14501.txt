I was at school and had a math test. We had a relief teacher and he was in the seat next to me (the class was different). He had the role with our results and my new mark was 46/56. I put in my calculator and it was 92% and I was thinking it was lame. Some time before, Jeremiah and someone were talking and I said I was top of my math class. Josephine had made something and we had to watch it -- her, Thuy and someone were running through the bush and there were weird angles of Thuy holding a tree. There was a board and people had written their Runescape names and I wrote mine. I think I was level 72. I got invited to a party. People were talking about me. Dad, although he wasn't at first, took me to a nightclub thing because he wanted me to ask people for dreams. I refused and left. I can't remember properly, but I was walking with Dad around mountains. There was music playing and it was an Erasure song. Some lady had a sandwich and said "I don't know about you, but peanut butter makes everything go away". The mountains were white and foggy. There was a sign about trout and semen -- to dodge it? Christa Miller was around (or on TV) and I said "Ugh, she sounds so annoying now". There were timeline pictures of her. Darren was a werewolf? He had almost killed a girl he hated, but remembered something and left her, but crushed her car.
