I was a kitten and my owner was telling me a story about a big big cat that lived underground and you had to lift up a rock and he's the one that brought me to my door. I grow to be a cat. But one day we were captured and put into this place that we had to work for people but we were able to go outside and play and one day I went outside and I saw this really cool rock and I lifted it and I saw some fur sticking out of the ground and I thought, "Gee, maybe it's the cat who brought me home" and so I started digging and he came up from the ground and started playing with me. And then one day there was a bomb in the whole place so we went into our closet in our little room and we found the secret passageway and we found the big cat. He took me home right to my door and then he stayed with me with our owner.
