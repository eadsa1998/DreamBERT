I dreamed I was putting my contacts in.  But they were four times their regular size, about an inch and a half across.  One side was fuzzy textured, like a peach, that's how I knew which side to put them in.  I also checked one in the crease of my palm to see if it was inside out.  I think it was.  You could not see through this fuzzy texture.
