I feel uneasy and uncomfortable because my gum is hurting me (this is true in real life). I attribute this to a false tooth. In the dream I see myself pulling at that tooth, pulling on it until I am able to tear it off and I immediately discover the reason for the pain. The tooth was misshapen so that it was exerting pressure on my gum. I cure my gum, which was infected, and then I don't know how to put the tooth back in.
