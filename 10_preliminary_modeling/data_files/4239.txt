["Strange charming man."] I am watching two black men in bed together. One is Bill Cosby. The other man is some charming man that is friendly. In his exuberance of friendliness, he is kissing Bill Cosby on his lips and cheek as he excitedly is talking about some interesting subject. Bill slowly becomes uncomfortable with this intimacy which seems more than just friendship. But he likes the man as a friend. Finally, Bill pulls away, uncertain of what is really happening. I feel uncomfortable about it too. It seems that the gestures are sexual in implications, beyond just friendship. Now Bill's wife is in another room. The charming man is with her and being effusively friendly with her as well, although they are not kissing. She is worried that this warmth may exceed friendly bounds and become an affair, which would be bad for her marriage. A white grandmother is also watching and she is starting to catch on that the wife and this charming man are having an affair. A top freezer compartment of a refrigerator is opened. Bill finds opened photo albums in there. He pulls them out to see the pictures that the charming man and the wife were looking at. A photo of the wife in her bridal gown. And other photos. He is also beginning to catch on that they had been looking at these photos together.
