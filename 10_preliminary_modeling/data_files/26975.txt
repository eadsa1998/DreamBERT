My girl friend came over with a mutual friend of ours, a boy whom I have dated off and on for over a year and who I met through her. They disclosed to my slyly that the time had now come for me to meet "the real John Doe" (the boy). I was mildly surprised to learn that this boy whom I had thought I knew so well was only taking the part of the real one. I was mildly interested in knowing what the "real John Doe" was like. At no time were my emotions about any of this very strong. I was only mildly affected by the strange happenings. On the way to the Real John Doe's house they told me that I would like the real one much better. Finally, we arrived and went down to the basement where he had his darkroom. The boy I know is very interested in photography, and the scene was familiar to me as being in his home and just the way we have gone down to inspect his darkroom in real life. When we got down into the basement, there was this "real John Doe" absorbed in his photography work. The one whom I had known as John said dramatically to me, "THIS---is the Real John Doe!" We said "how-do-you-do?" and he immediately began to tell me why his identity had been hidden from me. I thought it was all very nice, but it didn't surprise me that the real John expected the false John to do a fadeout. No one seemed to be surprised by anything. The real John had some of the same physical characteristics as the one I had known, but there was no mistaking one for the other. The real one seemed to be milder and kinder and had the look about him that would make people say at first glance, "My, isn't he a nice boy!" That was how he differed from the false John.
