It seems I had seen advertised in the paper some radios advertised for 16.95. I called up one of the department stores and inquired if they had the radios advertised. The clerk said no, but gave me a whole list of other radios he had. After I had hung up, I realized that I had known the voice on the telephone; it was some boy about 22 that I work with on Saturdays and I had not told him who I was. In the next part of the dream I went up to the ladies' rest room where I work on Saturdays. There were many present but I cannot remember what happened.
