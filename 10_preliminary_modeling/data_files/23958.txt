Mike and Johnny were over. They had to leave and Mike asked if he could take my car to the train station. I said sure even though his car was at my house too. Right after he left I realized..."what the fuck - why did he take my car?" The train station wasn't very far away. I ran to catch up. Right when I got there the train was just about to pull out of the station. It was an old black choo choo - like a miniature version. I jumped on and sat next to Mike. I figured I would get off at the next stop. I asked around what the next stop was but everyone around me was quiet and didn't really answer. I found out that it was an express train to New York. Shit! I couldn't get off. My environment seemed to change so that I was still in the train but now it was more like I was on an amusement park ride - I wasn't necessarily in a cabin but more of a single seat. I could view what I was approaching right in front of me. The train is going along on the tracks over a cool bridge. I could see nothing underneath the bridge. We traveled on a straight strip of track and I saw a handicapped person either on crutches or a wheelchair in the middle of the tracks. We were about to hit him but the train swerved right around him and off the tracks. <br/
