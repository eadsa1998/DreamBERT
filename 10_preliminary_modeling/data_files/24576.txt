Dreaming about (my) science project and shopping about thinking and talking. "Clos" was going to our topic, and Anne was a genius on long cut off at then end shorts so she was mentoring us, Kim was my partner in the project. [Sorry, Chris - this was verbatim and I couldn't make more sense of it. - SC] Setting: Gap Kids. Characters: Anne, friend at school. Kim, friend at school. Me. Feelings and Thoughts: Worried. Weird how I felt worried, but other than that I feel like it's normal, but I would never do a science project.
