My buddy (age 25, male) and I went to a pier on a lake or ocean. My buddy got into a boat with another person and rowed away from the pier. I attached a piece of shrimp to some fishing tackle and threw the line over the edge of the pier. Almost immediately I caught a large fish about 5 feet long and had to struggle hard to bring it in. Since I seldom fish and do not like the sport, I was exceedingly pleased with my accomplishment. Although I thought the fish was dead, it was only pretending. I carried the fish to a shack at the end of the pier, but it had turned into a bear and was alive. The bear was preparing to attack me and I picked up a pen knife and started plunging it into his body. Finally, I subdued the animal by puncturing his heart (red blood gushed out). I felt sad, however, because the bear skin was so full of holes that it couldn't be used for a coat.
