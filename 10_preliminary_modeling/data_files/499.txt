I am at a cottage at a lake where my in-laws stayed during the summer. My (adult) son is a baby in the dream and he falls into the water which is a river in the dream. He is struggling and I get him out and push him on the shore and then look for a cat which is missing. I learn it isn't the grey cat I should be looking for but the "nice" kitty that is grey with red strips. I find her in a cage, okay.
