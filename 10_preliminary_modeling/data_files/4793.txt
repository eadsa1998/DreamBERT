["Kyle down the river."] I am in a room with Kyle and Lenny and Amelia and some woman, maybe Ellie. Kyle is angry and wants to take the children. I don't want him to do that. I am worried for the children. He insists. They leave. I follow. He gets into a rowboat with the children. I plead with him to not go down the river with them. He doesn't know what dangers may be there. He doesn't know the course of the river and what may lie ahead. He does it anyway. I run ahead and see that there is a waterfall ahead. I wait for Kyle. The boat comes down the river and I wade out to him, telling him about the waterfall and taking the kids off the boat. He is angry at me.
