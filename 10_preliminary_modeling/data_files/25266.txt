 I'm in my front yard with my friends Hank Anderson and Norman Noman. We're playing football. We go to a park to play with my brother Wally and his friend Perry Glyde. It is snowing outside, but all the snow is melting. We all get dressed for the weather. Hank doesn't have any shoes, and he is outside. <br/
