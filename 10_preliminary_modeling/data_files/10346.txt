Frank and I are driving our car and come to a stop light. A young man from the Retreat Center sees us and asks us if he can come to our house and stay for a while. His pregnant wife is also there and they come to our house and settle in. No one asks for rent or what chores they need to do...I ask her the due date for her baby, she says October 3 and when I want to write it down I can't find any paper. Then I drive to the YWCA to swim, but find I forgot my swim suit. End up with Frank, making love, but wanting more privacy......
