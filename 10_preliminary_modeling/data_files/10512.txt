All the Sholes family members are at our house - SARA is sleeping in the attic; little Reynaldo is on the second floor; and Abe in bed in another room. All the rest of us want to go to a movie; we take a long time in giving instructions to STEVE (or Frank) who is staying home to baby sit. Finally SARA wakes up and says "I can do it now." Then both babies wake up and we get away late, or we decide to stay -- much confusion.
