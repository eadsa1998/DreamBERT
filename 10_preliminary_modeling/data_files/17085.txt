I was going to take my best friends Jenna and Emma in a hot air balloon.  It was small and shaped like a rocket.  There was a Backstreet Boys concert.  They were going to give out free memorabilia, and the van was parked outside our house.  Most of the band had left to get more stuff, but Kevin was still giving out his old clothes.  My classmate Mark got a leather jacket for his younger sister Kate.  Caroline Rae was there.  I fought her and another for some other item.  Kevin said something to convince them it was shabbier quality so they wouldn't want it.  He said something about me being St. Venus.  Thanks to Kevin, I got the sweater.  My crush Jose was there, and he put the sweater on.  He got out of the car and walked around to the passenger side.  I was going to help him take it off.  Something was troubling him, and he offered to do it himself.  He gave me the sweater and went back to the car.  He seemed upset, so I stuck my head in the window and asked what was wrong.   He didn't hesitate, but mumbled.  "I gotta ask you to go to someone's house, but you gave me the note, and I said no, and it's so soon after..."  I smiled and interrupted, and told him I'd be happy to go.
