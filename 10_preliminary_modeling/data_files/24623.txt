We were home alone, my sister and brother and I, for quite a piece of the day. When mom was at home, we would always have visitors. When home alone, we never answered the phone. When we met up with mom and dad, they asked if we'd answered the phone and when we hadn't they got mad at me and called me "mom." Setting: Outside on some pretty street. Characters: Mom, dad, sister, brother, me. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, worried. I don't know where in the world it came from.
