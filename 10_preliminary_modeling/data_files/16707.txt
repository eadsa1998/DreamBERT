I woke up this morning knowing I had a dream immediately before but I couldn't remember what it was about, so I decided to just let my body relax and thoughts from the dream flowed back into my head. All I remember is complaining about somebody putting the Barenaked Ladies song "McDonalds Girl" into the school newspaper, which in my dream I believe was called "El periodico". So, I was complaining to my school principal, trying to take apart the lyrics and explain why they were offensive to me. Of course, I wasn't really at all offended by this newspaper submission, but I still complained to the principal, Mrs. Lear, about it. Actually, I knew that there was no newspaper submission in the first place (I was just making it up), but I still felt the need to complain about it. Then, all I remember is talking to the person I blamed for the submission of the article, and he shows me the image of a little lego boat; and he told me something about the ship having sunk, or being about to sink.
