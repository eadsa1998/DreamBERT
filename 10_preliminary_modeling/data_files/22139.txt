I had just seen a movie (the theater was not familiar to me) and the screen was as small as a television set. I liked the movie, although it was a comedy (which I don't like in real life). In the theater I had been alone, but I came out with a girlfriend. We got into the car and went to her house. There was a party, but she wasn't interested in it and we went up to her room. We were talking and then her sister came in. She is my girlfriend. She introduced her to me and then told us to go downstairs, that the party was nice and that they were asking for us. My friend didn't want to go down, but I did, and I danced for a while and then went up again. I went into the room and found her crying on the bed. She told me she had a very serious problem and that the next day she would tell me about it. She was just going to go to bed. I went out and left, but in a different car from the one I had gone there with. I was on my way home when my alarm rang.
