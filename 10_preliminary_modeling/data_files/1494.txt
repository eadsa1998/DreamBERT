I am going to join a crew to help repair the Brooklyn Bridge. I have to go down a ladder. The first step is very long. I back off saying, "That first step is too hard for me." I feel sad because I shall have to give up. Then I look again and see that even if I fall, the ground is fairly close, so I decide to try it. It won't hurt so bad if I fall. I make it just fine, stepping on a moving seat for balance. Then I see a woman in the crew playing classical music on her shiny bassoon-like horn. A man is challenged and interested. He directs his jazz band. Battle of the bands. They square off.
