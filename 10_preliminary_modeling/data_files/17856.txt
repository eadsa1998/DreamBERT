I was asked by my supervisor at the observatory to work at the library.  At first I turned right and found myself on "Belle" street.  So I turned back to "Black Isle", the street I had been on, and went left.  Not exactly sure what I was supposed to be doing at the library.  I found myself looking for a book having something to do with sex.  I had some trouble, but finally found it.  I realized it was a good thing because I wouldn't have been comfortable asking for help to find it.  In the book were X-ray pictures of people interacting.  The frame of one person was small and made me wonder.  I looked at the spine of the book.  This was the 'after' book; the pictures were of a parent interacting with his child.   I turned the book over and found the book I was looking for there, with X-ray pictures demonstrating sexual positions.  I sat down to read the book and someone handed me a small child, maybe 8" tall, naked and bald, to babysit.  I held the baby and continued to read.  Someone said I should interact with the child, an idea that hadn't even occurred to me.  I still wanted to read the book, but I set the book down and looked at the baby.  He was under a year old, but when I asked him his name, he surprised me by responding!  "Fox" he said.  In disbelief I asked him again, and he responded.  I abandoned the book to talk to Fox; he was very smart and we talked like adults.
