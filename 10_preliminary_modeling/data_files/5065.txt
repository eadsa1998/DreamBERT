She takes me down a long hall, complaining that she can't breathe as she walks and hangs her shirt on a clothes line with herself in it so she can rest. I get angry at her and turn to go back and find the room. I see a sign that says "B's Enterprises Brothel." I sneer, "Who did that! "The woman is proud to say she did. It is in vibrant pink colors.
