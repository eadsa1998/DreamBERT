I see a small pool of water between the stair and door.  The door is still open.  I sit at the pool/fountain and am pushing small pebbles around with my bare foot, moving them into places.  Cher says, when I take my foot out, that I am tracking rocks around (the steps) or (her house).  I pick up the pebbles with my toes and put them back in the water.  Slightly embarrassed at getting her house dirty.
