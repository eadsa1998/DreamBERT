Gladys and I were walking along the corridor of a big building standing where U.S. Treasury is located (not Treasury Bldg). There were a good many double doors to pass through (as when going along corridor of Internal Rev. Bldg. paralleling 10th St). Gladys told me it was illegal to open both doors -- that is, north bound pedestrians were to open only the door to their right (east door) and south bound walkers the west door only. Once or twice I became confused as to which was proper door to open, and on these occasions Gladys said in a slightly impatient voice "Well, go ahead." As we left the building (on 15th St. side) we saw a snow ball battle in progress. Not clear who contestants were. On the sidewalk we met a Mr. Smith who had on a thread-bare overcoat; he insisted that I join him and his party in a meal, but I had an errand to do (or possibly an appointment) which would take me west of White House, maybe to Allies Cafe. Smith brought out (from building) one of his friends to be introduced. I left them at corner of 15th and N.Y. Ave. Gladys had vanished, without causing me to wonder, as soon as we left the building.
