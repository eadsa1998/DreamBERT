My father is driving, Mabel is sitting next to him. Howard and I are with them in a VW bus. I have a painful boil on my leg. It hurts. I want the pain to go away. I'm waiting for us to get to our destination so Howard can lance the boil and remove the pain. I think to myself, "I don't have to wait for him to do it. Why am I waiting? I can do it myself and get rid of the pain." Mabel is trying to soothe the feelings between Howard and me (I'm the only one in the back seat). I'm angry, grumpy and sad. She says something soothing like, "Give it a chance." I say, "There is no chance. Howard is a sickie, an emotional sickie." We pass a camping area. A man and a young girl are talking. I hear her say, "I killed her. The other girl and I killed her." I see small camp spots with steep boat ramps to the water. There is no place to stretch out and relax, just space to put the car and boat. I see a stream that's rusty colored and polluted. My father comes to a crossroad, a "T." He's going to turn left. The car is too far out into the intersection. 3 vehicles go by, very close, ready to hit us. I flinch as they go by. The 3rd one honks.
