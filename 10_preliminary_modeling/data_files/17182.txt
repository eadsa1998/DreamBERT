I dreamt of a steep desert cliff at sundown and a roller coaster, quite a dangerous setup, particularly because the track was not finished.  There was a car ride and I went to a radio station at a cabin.  I think I was going to visit my online friend Del.  My boyfriend Jeremy was there, in a dress.  I had to get stuff ready to go quickly, and I couldn't stay as long as I'd planned.
