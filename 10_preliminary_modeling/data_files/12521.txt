I was at Mom's. Ezra was there. I lifted this heavy thing and when I lifted it, I bit down and it felt like something smashed. I finally ended up looking and discovered that two of my teeth had shattered. We were looking for a 24 hour dentist. I ended up going home and was playing some computer game.
