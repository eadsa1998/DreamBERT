I am somewhere in a house and someone, maybe a dad, comes in and asks why aren't I already out there, maybe going swimming. And I say, "Maybe I'm afraid to go out there." I am sort of like Goldie Hawn in a weird black swim suit that has long legs like those running shorts. I say, "I can't go out in this."
