["Not much to eat."] My mother is visiting and we are hungry. I go to the refrigerator to get something to eat. I look around the shelves to discover we have very little food. We have plenty of eggs, lettuce and carrots. Nothing else. I guess we have to go to the store and replenish our supply. Then I remember we still have canned goods and soups in the cupboards.
