I was at a Harris family reunion with Bill C. He proposed to me. He was sitting at a table and I was standing next to him. There was a single red rose there and a piece of chocolate cake. He started talking about depending on me and something else. He dug his fingers down into the chocolate cake and pulled out an engagement ring. He was licking the chocolate cake off of it. I made a comment about our mutual love of chocolate. The ring was a very unusual shape. It was large and had a very high setting. A piece of the setting on the top also jutted out to the side. I don't know how to describe it nor do I have a very clear picture of it anymore. After that I was talking to various family members and they were saying how much they liked him. From a distance I was watching him interact with people.
