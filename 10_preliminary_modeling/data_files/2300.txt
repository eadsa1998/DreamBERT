I am directing my own play. I see two male twins, dark hair, moustaches. I think it would be fun to write them in and then the play is being performed and I'm in it, looking out at the audience. Then I'm in the audience, watching as Ellie and I are in front of the curtain. I'm on her shoulders and she loses her line and we both fuddle around. I fall down. "I" in the audience notices we look very much alike, plump, etc. I crawl and then get up and run off stage, amazed I could do it myself and get ahead of Ellie. Now I'm on stage again and bowing. I see people putting a table and chairs for the awards dinner. I go down and sit next to this old guy. He says he was miserable, but I inspired him. I sigh, "I suppose you mean my disability." He says yes. I am not pleased. It spoils my award dinner and I regret having sat next to him. Ellie is several chairs over to my right.
