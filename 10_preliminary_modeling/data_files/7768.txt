I was at a hotel for a conference. I met Wes S there. He invited me to come to his room with him and another woman. I was hesitant but, as in the past, had a hard time telling him no. When I got to the room another woman came in also and another man. I noticed a large round pendant around Wes S's neck. It was clear with something red inside of it. I left because I was uncomfortable with the sexual atmosphere in the room. After I left, the room transformed into two large meeting rooms. Many of the employees of the hotel were going in and joining in the activities. The activities remind me of the movie Eyes Wide Shut. As I was walking through the hotel, I overheard members of management getting upset because so many employees were missing. They were going to fire all of them. I decided to just leave. I went to the parking garage to find my car. All of the cars but mine were very expensive cars and limos. Mine looked like an oversized chair. I folded it down and it became a car. As I getting ready to get into my car, I saw Wes S's pendant lying on the ground. I knew it was important to him so I decided to go find him and return it to him. I was walking outside on a second or third floor with an atrium in the middle. I thought I heard Wes S down below. I looked over the rail and he was there. I told him I had his pendant. When I met him to give his pendant back, he apologized profusely for what happened in the room. He said the other women weren't important to him and he asked me to marry him.
