I'm in a department store, looking for the cigarettes, a carton of Salems. The store has been remodeled. I can't find them. I am holding a carton of cigs, the carton is bright red and the cigs are not Salems, so I keep looking. I see a display case with "novelty" cigs; they are Salems. One jar is full of fat candy cigarettes with chocolate tips. Another has cigars, fat, with a "fringe" on it. I decide to take the candy cigs because the regular ones can't be found and they are better than nothing. Then Ginny brings me some of hers, the real kind.
