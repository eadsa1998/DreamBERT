A group of women had gathered in my home for some kind of meeting, without giving me any notice. It wasn't a meeting that I was a part of. I was just allowing them to have this meeting at my home. I'd noticed that they might run out of chairs. I told one or two of them that they were welcome to pull any of the chairs from the dining room into the living room. There were three different kinds of chairs in the dining room. I told them to feel free to pull whichever ones were most comfortable into the living room, and as many as they needed. There was also a conversation about housekeeping. I must have apologized for my house not being cleaned. Someone had tried to reassure me that it's fine. I explained that since I live alone and so seldom have people in my home I don't make housecleaning a priority. With having so many other things to do housekeeping seldom seems that important. I usually know in advance when someone is coming so I have time to clean before they come. There is also something about food or refreshments.
