My pet lizard was escaping from its large enclosure as it climbed too high and was attacked by a bird. She jumped, fell, and lost her tail in the process. At the same time, my dog ran out of the house and I went to get him. The door was open, and the lizard escaped. She ran into the brush. I saw her go, but figured she'd be easy to find. I put the dog back in the house and went looking for the lizard, but couldn't find her. Eventually, I gave up, but then got a hunch -- put myself in her mind -- and got my headlamp and found her under the concrete ramp leading up to the steps. Then it was a matter of catching her without hurting her. Her tail had come off, and I put it, still moving, down on the ground to morbidly push a block or something. When I went after her, her tail had mostly grown back. I tried to position myself so that she wouldn't run under the house, but she did anyway. Oh well.
