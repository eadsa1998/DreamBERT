I am with a group of men who are submariners. We are on land in the country. They have been detected and seek to escape. They seem to be a mix of Americans and Russians. I climb on top of the submarine, which is also on dry land; the Captain, a Russian, stands beneath me, I steer the ship like a car down a long dirt road. We are spotted by Russian agents disguised as civilians. Soon we are being chased by men who seek to arrest us. I drive faster and faster and seem to have lost them. Then we must get out of the submarine because I have driven into a cul-de-sac. It is now every man for himself; I try hiding in the cellar of a barn, but am not quick enough, and am caught, as is the Captain. Then I escape, I run and find a woman sitting outside her house and ask her for help; she does not help me. I keep running, I seem to have obtained freedom, but then I am at the edge of the sea. There are great sand dunes that reach into the clear water. I am being pursued again and have no choice: I swim into the ocean, The water is warm and clear, the waves are big but not violent. It is very light and sunny, I attempt to escape by swimming under water. However, at close range three Russian agents triangulate my position. Looking beneath me, I see a large dark American submarine that has come to my rescue and begins to rise from below. However, it is too late. The agents begin shooting with pistols and high powered rifles and I am shot.
