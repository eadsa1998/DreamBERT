This dream took place in South Vietnam. I was a soldier and was with what seemed to be a column of soldiers who were heading for a seaport to board Navy ships and be sent back home. We looked dirty and battle weary. I remember coming into the port on a muddy dirt road. We were all walking and as we came into the port, we saw lots of ships, most of which were damaged and battle worn. I remember seeing a few sailors around working. We finally boarded what looked like a barge with a top on it, that had benches extending down either side of it. The last thing that I remember is sitting down on the bench. I didn't recognize anyone in the dream.
