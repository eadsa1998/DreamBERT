I was Wonder Woman and I was throwing a lasso over people and making them tell the truth. In my dream I also saw an Asian girl who was pretending to be Wonder Woman, but I knew she was a fraud and everyone else around us knew she wasn't the real Wonder Woman. I threw a lasso over her so she would tell the truth. I wanted to help her.
