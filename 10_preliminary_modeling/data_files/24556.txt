My Dad and I were throwing a surprise birthday party for my Mom. When Dad found out his friends' wives had birthdays, we combined all of them. One of those birthdays belonged to my coach, Marilyn. When it was time for the party, Kim and Nancy (Marilyn's daughters) brought over their dog. That dog fell in our pond, and Greta, a girl from my school) picked up a "scooper" and tried to fish out the dog. I yelled at her to stop, but she just crumpled up the scooper. Soon, the dog floated close enough to the edge that I picked her up. But when Kim tried to pick her up, she bit her. Then Greta said it was a mountain lion, and the real dog was in the bushes. Then we threw the mountain lion over the fence. Setting: My backyard. Characters: Dad, me, Kim, Nancy, Greta, and Nancy's dog. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared. I thought it was scary, 'cause if you think about it, a mountain lion is pretty scary.
