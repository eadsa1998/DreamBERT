In this dream I recall being with some old buddies from high school. I can only recall one in particular, although there were about 3 or 4 there. The one that I recall was named Hugh, and had blonde hair, was about 5'10" and weighed about 150 lbs. We were all at the Dairy Queen on 27th Avenue and 36th Street. For some reason Hugh and I were scuffling around in a friendly manner, wrestling, etc., kind of like horse play. Then he and I went over to the order window and I ordered a chocolate cone, and he ordered the same. I remember that I didn't want a 15 cent cone because I thought they were too large. Hugh also ordered a 10 cent chocolate. The last I remember is getting the chocolate cone from the woman at the window.
