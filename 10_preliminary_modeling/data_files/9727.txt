Attending the liturgy: POPE JOHN (looking younger and not wearing robes) stands nearby. I am with the altar boys: and Frank is next to me. He stands right next to Pope John, but does not seem to be inspired. I am so awed and inspired, but Frank walks out and Pope John says: "well you can't keep a Unitarian from walking out of Church." I say: "There must be a way to make the rules stricter to inspire greater awe." I tremble as we touch; then walk out through the half-open door ("narrow door").
