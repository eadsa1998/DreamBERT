I am an observer in this dream. Some kids in the high school steal money and hide it in a certain place. They come back for a reunion and know where it is. One needs it for a child's operation and takes it all. The rest let him get by with it. All of these kids are now upstanding citizens and are worried about this coming out, but it doesn't.
