Matthew and I were moving into this new apartment. It was here in the city where I live yet it was on the beach. It was a big place. It was one story. Had a big screened in porch. There was a lot of room. Bill F and Brian F were moving in with us too. There were two different rooms that I was deciding between for my office. The first one I decided on we had moved all my things into. Then I decided that the other one faced the screened-in porch and ocean so I decided to make that my office instead. That way I could work in there and listen to and feel the ocean. Then there were two other rooms. One for storage and another for a laundry room. It wasn't a fancy place. I was just absolutely in love with it because it was on the ocean and because of the screened-in porch. I kept saying how great it was to be on the ocean and that it was even less expensive than where we were living now. Bev and her family were there helping us move. As we were moving I was asking different people if they had been out to the beach yet. Bev had because she loves the ocean as much as I do and she just thought it was so great. I said, good, now you'll come to visit me more. She said, Absolutely. Especially in the summer. I asked her if she had taken Rachel S out to the beach yet and she said she had and that Rachel S had loved it. Stephen F was there and Mari Kate S. They were being especially helpful. One other thing I remember is that there was a lot of furniture that I was trying to move around in these rooms. I at least wanted to get all of the furniture to the right rooms before everyone left. Some of the furniture was in pieces and had to be put back together.
