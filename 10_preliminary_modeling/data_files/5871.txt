I see some brown chickens running around the yard and decide to scoop one up and so do using a butterfly net. Finally get one and then I smash the net on the ground a few times to either kill or stun it. I stop and then see it is really a brown red fox and not a chicken. I empty the net and it falls on the ground, stunned. I grab a club and beat it unmercifully ... many blows. It seems to take much time and the fox appears to be looking at me and pleading for mercy. At one point its claw raises and seems to be staying my blow as it touches my arm. But eventually I beat it to death.
