A vigil at the Book Cafe: I see a procession for some group of suffering peoples. I follow Patrick around and hear people singing as they march. Afterwards I hail a taxi and find $25.- in my purse I did not know I had. The taxi driver carries several sacks of flour into the cab, but I have enough room to sit. He drives me home and asks for a $6.- fare....I see familiar sights.
