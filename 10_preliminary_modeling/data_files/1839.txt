I am driving my van, but can't find the keys to start it. I ask Ellie to find the keys in my purse. She's in the passenger seat. She says she can't find them. I notice I have somehow started the van without keys. I get mad at her and say, "Keep looking!" It feels like she's not trying hard enough. She finds them and we drive away.
