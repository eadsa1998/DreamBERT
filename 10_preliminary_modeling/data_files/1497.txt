I am in danger of being shot by some guy. I call out to Bonnie to come here because I want to talk to her. She's busy and ignores me as she talks to someone else. I pace restlessly, noticing I am passing windows that look out over a forested (jungle) area. I suddenly realize that I can protect myself. I don't have to wait for Bonnie. I put my back to a solid wall.
