I was at some place with the school. They were talking about who would make a good couple. The teachers thought that Eugene and I would. There was something about werewolves. Later, there was a list of 'who likes who'. It had Rafe Spall with 'Lauren Sarah Broughan' or something. It had Jerry O'Connell with Mad Max II. There were Pokemon cages? This stone, which was a kind of light, was lit when you put a piece of paper underneath it and it would be used as a projector. I tried it and it didn't work. I found this water and I realized that it couldn't be seen through the water. Some guy asked for the list. I saw Eugene nearby and then I heard this guy who sounded like Dmitri. Calvin was there too.
