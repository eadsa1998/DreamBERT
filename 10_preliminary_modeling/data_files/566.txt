My two daughters are visiting me and the older one, Julie, is flying a helicopter. We are outside in a basement entry area and I discover tracks from next door. In the basement we find bells on ropes from a Christmas play, rotten tomatoes and other stuff. Julie keeps the tomatoes but discovers they are rotten. Then the two girls leave. I see the helicopter in the distance and my youngest daughter, April, is hanging out the bottom. I think "oh, my God she forgot to buckle up." Soon the helicopter lands and Julie says she lost April someplace. We hear April crying. She is walking behind and is all bruised on the right side. I think it isn't too bad and then I see her top right femur which is open and bleeding and bent up like a chicken wing.
