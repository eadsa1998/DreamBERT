I was driving my car down a street in Santa Cruz trying to read a piece of paper. I saw two guys who I think were the members of the group 'The Red Hot Chili Peppers'.  The windows were rolled down along with my sun roof. I heard them say something about their dog (white) being hit. I then remember bumping something with my car, but when I looked in the rear window I saw nothing, so I thought nothing of it. Later, I found my dog on the road. I had hit her and killed her. I felt so sad. My sister, who owns the dog was looking. When she found out she didn't seem distraught at all. I remember feeling so sad. Later she wobbled into the living room and I couldn't figure out where she came from.
