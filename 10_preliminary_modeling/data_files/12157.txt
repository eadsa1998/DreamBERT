I was really young and we were at some place on hills. These bad people had Mom captive. Granma, Uncle Gabriel, a girl my age (I was about 4 in the dream) and I went into tunnels. Granma and the girl went in first. Uncle Gabriel and I ended up at this door with beanbags next to it. There was a big guy. The door opened and a girl ran out and we hid. Uncle Gabriel went to go in but I thought it was a trap and then the same girl ran out again, I realized that she was a hologram and I went to warn him but it too late and this woman took him. I ran back down the tunnels and remembered another tunnel. There was a game and there were gems throughout worth $9 each. The girl was in the captain's room. Something changed. There were Yoshi or Bone characters and at this hospital they turned invisible.
