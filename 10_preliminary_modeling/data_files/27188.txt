I dreamed that I had a job as counseling. My older brother and I were walking to my office when I saw a group of people standing in front of the door. One of the bodies turned around and I recognized her as the sister of a friend of mine. (This friend at one time meant very much to me. We had planned to be married as soon as I finished college.) The sister, R--, showed surprise at seeing me, as she didn't realize that I was the counselor she had made an appointment with. She made some remark about my being successful and also about my settling down and getting married. I realized then that she thought my brother was my husband. I proceeded to introduce him to all the people. Mr. D., R's father, did not remember me at all, and R explained to me that his memory was failing.
