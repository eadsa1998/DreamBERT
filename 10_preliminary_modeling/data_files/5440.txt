Last night I had a dream that I was swimming in the river in Van Gogh's Starry Night Over the Rhone. It was cold and windy, but the water was warm. There were islands that were actually paintings, and sometimes I wanted a break, so I would grab onto the paintings, but then the oil would run and the canvas was ruined.
