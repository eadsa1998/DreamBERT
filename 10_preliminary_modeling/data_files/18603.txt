I didn't have any money so I went to this cafeteria restaurant that had a different set-up on Tuesdays. According to their level of "difficulty" (only in terms of physical labor--output of energy necessary to complete the job) there were different pay scales. For wheeling around the dessert cart to tables and keeping it stocked you made $2.10/hr. Bussing tables was next on the ladder and on up to dishwashing, floor scrubbing and table setting. They gave you your cash at the end of your shift and I was gonna come back tomorrow. The sign on the blackboard said $8.50/hr. broke down to $5.60/hr after taxes. So I could make $40 in one day and that would help a lot. I was roller-skating behind Rudy and a stranger named Justin. I passed them going uphill. They acted like they didn't see me. I met them outside at a restaurant. Justin was going to get married---they had rented the restaurant to have a private wedding. I made a comment about the fancy-fake restaurant--a smart-ass comment and I offended everybody there. The only thing I could do was leave. On the way out, Jasmine was coming in. She wanted to paint and my paints were on the floor. I was learning to use meringue as a medium. Not from the pie, but from my mother's mixing bowl before she got the pie finished. Haney called me and said, "I'm doing a show at Cooper Union." And I said, I just had a show there. I heard you practicing with a black lady who was screaming." The lady who told me and Evelyn she was broke was lying. She had seven dollars stuck in her bra.
