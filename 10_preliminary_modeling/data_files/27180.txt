I was sitting in a bank on a couch with several other people who I did not know. I was reading some book. I looked up and saw my Aunt and I remember putting my head down so that she couldn't see me. She cashed a check and walked out without seeing me and I remember sighing a sigh of relief that she hadn't seen me. Then I woke up.
