I was looking out the window of my bedroom. We had company downstairs and they were playing cards with my parents. I heard this motor roaring as it went by our house, and I had a funny feeling something was going to happen. It was daylight out and I could see real well what happened. This one car that was going fast started to pass another car but when he got halfway past, another car from the opposite direction plowed into it head on. It was a terrific crash with the people falling out of the cars and laying there. I ran downstairs and had my dad call the police. Then the people who were playing cards with my father and mother went to the scene of the accident to give first aid. I went too and my dream ended.
