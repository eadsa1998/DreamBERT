I was at this place and everyone from school was there. There was a ghost. Everyone was told to get in the pool because someone was going to kill me. Not everyone got in the pool though. I remember Seamus, Elijah, Dmitri, Rebekah and Alyssa didn't. There was a blackout and I got stabbed and fell into the pool. I didn't die.
