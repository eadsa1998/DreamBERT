Mabel is organizing some group of musicians for a rehearsal. She calls me over to her to explain what's happening. She's seated and facing a stage with musicians and singers on it. I lean over so that her hair is touching my face. I enjoy that soft, intimate moment,  aware that if she noticed what I was doing, she'd withdraw. She tells me she must work with the main group and asks if I would meet with a small group of them to explain non-musical details. The person designated to do that didn't show up. I agreed and went over to one side to meet my group. They are on the stage and so I go over there and quietly listen in as they are talking. A curtain is between us. They say how nice it is that the Ricatta Inn is lowering their rates for the seven of them. It is better than having to walk so far to the YWCA. Now, maybe next year, more people would have heard of the lower rates and will sign up. One woman peeks down at me from the curtain "Are you a sophomore?" she asks. I say, quite surprised, "Oh no. I'm..." I couldn't remember what year I was. Then I remember. "I'm a graduate student. And then I've been going to school at the community college. This is my last term. I guess I'd better find out what I'm going to do for the rest of my life as a job." I feel a little startled and scared. I'd been drifting along, going to school and taking it easy. Now I had to think about real work.
