I am given a home video camera and I begin to film what I see. I have some trouble keeping things in focus and also keep forgetting that I'm in charge. I'll hum and then remember that the camera will pick up that. Or I'll not pay attention to what's in the frame and then remember and shift focus. I hear background noises of a huge crowd cheering and as a satire joke, I film a race of toy motorcycles. Then I see a scene of small plastic people and I film it, chuckling to myself at my creative cleverness. I turn a knob that changes the focus spot from a circle to a square and back again and I adjust it back and forth. I took a picture of the picture on the TV screen. Now I see through the camera viewfinder a good-looking man. I like him and start to show him my editing choices, feeling excited about sharing with him how good I am and anticipating his approval of me. But he's doing something else, like wanting me to take a picture of him and not listening to me. I stop mid-sentence and feel disappointed and frustrated. I then concentrate on focusing on his beautiful eyes. I go in for an extreme close-up and back out for his full, lovely face.
