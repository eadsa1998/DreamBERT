It was at my friends house in their downstairs party room and in their upstairs rooms as well. I remember four people Becca, Kelly, Paul and me. They are all 16 and we hang out together. Becca and Paul were watching the carebears movie in the party room. They were sitting on a Futon. I was upstairs helping Kelly find clothes and then went and watched the movie as well. I couldn't believe Paul thought carebears was cool. Kelly was no longer in the dream from this point on, just Becca, Paul and me. Becca was telling me to be quiet because she was watching the movie and Paul was talking about how cool the bad guy was. The dream was not unpleasant at all but the dream was not pleasant either.
