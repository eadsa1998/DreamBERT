Now I'm a passenger in a car. The son of the horrible man is driving. A woman (perhaps Darcy) is behind me. We have escaped with the help of the son. We must constantly be moving in a random way so "he" won't find us. We meet him several times and he grabs my leg and I panic. I pull away but it's hard as I'm not very aggressive, mostly afraid. We can never stop. It is merely another form of torture that will go on forever.
