Jan. 31 is supposed to be the day. I liked the day and had it. It seemed to be a day that was my luck or something pertaining to it. I saw Albert Lasko and Jack Lasko in caskets at different places and days. They were deceased. I was looking over the entries and I saw Ghibli or something similar. I know the horse Glibhi. It was in large print in one of the later races and I noticed it and I said, "I am going to play this one," and I wrote it down. I said, "That will be a winner."
