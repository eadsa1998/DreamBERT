I dreamed I was in a large  room, a waiting room of some sort. There were quite a few people in it. What we were waiting for was a turn in these sort of public baths that they had, which were not Greek or Roman style (large swimming pool-type things), but just a long bath tub. I didn't seem to think it strange that we were waiting, or that there was even anything unusual about it, except that this was in Paris somewhere. All around the people spoke French. I saw a boy that I knew. I went down and sat beside him. He's a blond boy who is a graduate student in English at my university. We started talking. He was tired of waiting and he wanted to go somewhere to find a half bath. He wanted to know if I didn't want to go with him, but I decided that I didn't. I'd rather share a huge bath full of strangers than one bath with somebody that I knew that well. He plays the guitar very well and he and several other people in the room now had guitars and were playing them. I showed him the guitar that we had recently gotten and I asked him if he thought it was a good one. He started playing it and then he started to tune it. He took all the strings out and I thought that surely wasn't necessary in order just to tune it.
