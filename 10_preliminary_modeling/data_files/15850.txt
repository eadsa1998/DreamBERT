I was working at this shopping centre. I wasn't supervising but I had equipment with me. There were quite a few close parking spots, so I parked and went in. Then I wasn't working and it was like a hotel or something. I can't remember what happened properly, but there was a lady with long red nails who was a werewolf. The colour red would set her off. She had some control over it, but was dangerous. I was with someone else and we went into one of the rooms. We went into the other room and there was a window at ground level with no curtains. We were scared because she was nearby and might see us. I started trying to cover myself with a blanket, but then I realised it was red. I jumped up and told the person I was with we should leave. Her husband or boyfriend was also around and we warned him (he didn't know she was a werewolf). We ran out to my car - I couldn't remember where I parked at first, but I easily found it because it was such a bright red and my licence plate was clearly 1CEZ -084 [my actual number plate]. The guy I was with jumped in the driver's seat and I was a bit annoyed because it was my car but I got in the passenger seat and gave him the keys. I told him to lock the doors but reached over myself and locked it. We drove for a while and then it was night. We stopped in the middle of the street for some reason and got out and the guy got attacked by the werewolf. She hadn't changed fully. I told her something in exchange for leaving me be, but she could only control it for so long, so I got back to the car and took off. I was meeting others somewhere nearby. I got to fork and couldn't remember if it was left or right, but I turned right. Then I was on World of Warcraft and was questing and it was like this outside area with these leafy plant creatures and a bunch of scientists. I had to kill like 40 of them.
