This dream was short, very vivid and made a deep impression. It took place in a very dingy and depressing room which was about 20 ft. square. The room was part of a prison. One wall was lined with bunks five high. I was in the top bunk. A door was in the wall that was perpendicular to the beds. The room was not painted and was not plastered but covered with cement and had the gloomy gray color of cement. The blankets of the bed were pulled up to my neck and were of a blackish gray. A guard (whom I didn't know and whose age I didn't notice) came into the room with a package for me. I tried to get out of the bunk to get the package. I threw the covers back but I couldn't get down to the floor.
