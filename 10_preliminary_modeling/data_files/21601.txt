A little baby was riding on a horse. He made a quick stop and the baby almost fell off. Then the horse started to go and the baby slid back. A male horse came by and the 2 horses began to fight. The baby threw himself between the two horses' heads and it was pushed, bucked and I think chewed. I turned my face away from the thought. The two horses seemed to disappear. I figured they fell thru the window. I went to the window, looked down and there was one horse. His feet were caught in the closed window. He was on the porch roof and sort of mangled. I opened the window and gave him a kick and down he slid. I looked down on the street and there lay one horse dead and his head was off, missing, dissected. Part of his body was scattered on the ground. I was going to tell Andy P. of the fate of his horses. I met Peter Arendas and I gave him a dollar to give one of his friends who I owed it to. I drove and it was a stop and go most of the while. I drove along and came across a broken bridge. It was lying in the creek. I saw polar bear. I seemed to repeat five when I wanted to say which horse was going to win out of the horses. 5 was belly ache. The baby that lay still after the horses brought it up, got up and came to life.
