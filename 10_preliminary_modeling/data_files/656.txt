I am lost in "New Mexico City" with a woman whom I think is my sister, and with my son and daughter, who are children. We are in an old, dirty neighborhood and I get separated from them. I hope they stay together. I had to use a dirty old mission bathroom and I am scared. I get knocked down and a little boy tries to help me, then pinches my breast and runs. There is a beautiful old castle where they give tours. Also signs advertising a chili contest and souvenirs picturing past winners. I am trying to work my way back to where the others are and nothing looks familiar. I have to get back to go to the airport or get on a ship. There is also something in the dream about needing protein.
