I dreamt I joined the Air Force and I was flying jets in Korea. I had 40 enemy aircraft to my credit. All I had to do was shoot down one more plane and I would exceed Major Bong's record of 40 planes and set a new record of planes shot by United States aviators. I was on a mission somewhere over the enemy lines. I spotted my 41st plane and had him in my crosshairs and was just about to press the firing button when I woke up.
