It's dark at night and I'm driving my car in the rain. I stop and all the sudden I'm at the front door of someone's house (I've never seen this doorway before). This girl I work with at Beach City named Mary answers the door. She starts talking and says something like, "I'm so glad you're finally asking me out. Talking to you at work was getting so awkward." For some reason I can't tell her that I don't like her at all, and next we're both in my car driving to the mall. Now we're walking around a whole bunch of different food courts and I keep thinking, "This girl really likes me. I could easily get a piece, then never talk to her again." But I know this would be wrong. While I'm debating this, I wake up.
