I was at home alone. I was going to stay at Mom's later. I saw a lady who looked like Rebecca Romijn-Stamos out the back trying to get in. I yelled at her and she ran away. A few minutes later I was on the phone to Mom and other people came. They stopped running from me and they were checking out the games room window. I told Mom to get me now. Where the games room window was, was now a door (which was two doors). They started pushing a limousine into it. Finally they pushed it open and I ran to my room and told them not to take my stuff and that they could take anything else. One guy said "you can have anything but your stuff". I said I'd give him $5000 for my laptop and he said ok. I left with Mom. Later I went back and there was basically nothing left in the house. I called Dad, and I also had Gunther listed in my contacts. He came and I discovered my laptop was gone and they left some stingy one. I was really upset. I said I didn't want to have to make my Excel spreadsheet for my dreams again or type up my dreams again (even my external hard drives were gone). I was also thinking of the photos I'd lost and the ones I'd taken of Eugene. Dad was doing some quiz on the internet for something. The window in Ezra's room had been taken off. I got a text from one of the guy's and a computer game had stingy requirements. His text said "nice cats man, the next thing they lose is their skin". I found a skull in the cupboard under the microwave and it looked fake, but it was real and it was Mittens's. I thought if Mittens was dead, then Tigger must be dead too and I was really upset.
