My third dream was kind of crazy. I went with my ex-boyfriend to the mall in Canton, but it was my other ex-boyfriend. One's name is Devan, the other Bobby - both are my ex-boyfriends. Bobby would always be talking in the dream, but his appearance always looked like Devan. It was Bobby's voice, but Devan's face and body. Anyway Devan/Bobby gave me money to go shopping in the mall. I bought soap, lotion and a jacket. Plus, I had my own money. Devan's mother met us at the train station and took us to the Canton mall. His mother thought that we were back together, but we told her that we were just friends. Then I woke up.
