["Juvies defy me."] I am a substitute teacher for a group of juvenile tough teens, all male. They decide to walk out of the classroom and hang out talking in the hall, near the open door of another classroom. I walk out to them and tell them to come back into the classroom. They jeer and talk back. An obvious power struggle. I say to them, well, it's too bad you are deciding to have the natural consequences of your actions. I'll call in the principal and we'll decide your punishment. I turn and start to walk away. I am hoping they decide to come back. They get quiet, thinking. Then slowly they start returning. I am very relieved.
