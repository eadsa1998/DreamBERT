The girls and I are on a journey. We stop at a cafe/bar to have lunch. Young men dance suggestively. We were given silver gifts by the waiter. I decide we should leave. We go to the check out stand. The woman starts to add up our bill. A cup of butter is $150. They charge me for some gifts. I refuse to pay. I give them back. The waitress is rude and calls for the manager. I am firm. "I didn't order the butter, I won't pay for it." We leave. We get in the car to drive into the night. Ellie is in the front with me. Dovre and Paulina are in the back. I can't see Paulina, but I can feel her there. Then Dovre gets in the front. It's too crowded and I ask her to get in the back. She won't. We argue. I get angry. It interferes with my driving. Finally she does. Then we go to Aunt Esther's house. It's  by the beach. I want to go to the beach. I open the back window. I see a cliff and the beach. A brown cloud scurries by. We decide it's too cold to swim today. We go for a walk. I see a miniature train. There are miniature copies of grandma Mildred's coffin. I ask Aunt Esther to show me how the train works. As it moves by, miniature people smile and wave. They are cute. I wave back and feel silly because they aren't real. Dora comes over to tell me to be careful on my journey. She had gone to the same bar and had been raped by a woman. She then proceeds to tell and show me the whole story. I'm embarrassed because Uncle Wilbur and Aunt Esther are watching. She lies down in a slinky green harem-type outfit and wiggles around. She describes the woman's touches on her breasts, etc. She says, "After that, I stopped fighting. I kind of liked it."
