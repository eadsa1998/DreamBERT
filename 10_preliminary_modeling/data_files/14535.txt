I was in a carpark. I needed to pee. This lady was there. I saw a little kitten and I grabbed it and put it in the car, which I went into to pee. I was going to bring the kitten into the pet shop, but it ran out of the car. Fido was running around. I chased the kitten and Fido was too. I tried to stop Fido and he ran into the shop and before I could do anything, he ate it in one bite. I was like 'noo!' and shocked and upset. I went to the toilet, which had dodgy doors. I did a poo and I heard it hit the water. I got up and the toilet wouldn't flush.
