I live in an apartment at the top of the stairs. Apparently they are giving a tour of the building because people are coming in. I don't want them in and I run to the side door and slam it shut and lock it and go to the living room and shut the drapes, and make a sign that says "Not On Tour" and tape it to the front door and slam it shut, but not before a man, a woman, and a teen girl come in. They are stealing things from me and I go to the bedroom and get my shotgun. I come out and point it at the man. He laughs, and continues to take things. I aim at a shoulder or a leg, a nonvital part, and I shoot. I mean business. He backs off. I shoot the woman in the stomach and she falls out of the room and down some stairs. I go to see her and she is curled in a fetal ball with lots of blood coming out of her belly area. Now I pick her up and run to the emergency room with her. They are busy and not too caring there. I carry her to a bed a nurse takes me to.
