I was on Runescape and some people were doing a competition for people to run down a freeway and the winner got houses on Runescape with good items in there, and also random items like "tuna and a waterfall seed". Then I was in a shop and people were gathering for it. I had to find a girl called Bwana Como or something. I found her, then I was a guy and I wasn't me. He told her he had a surprise, but within a short time he fell in love her. The next day, they woke up together and he had slept with her. They had been sleeping on metal pipes. His mate complained about her. He saw a creepy dude watching him. Then I had to get in to this place with some stuff. Someone had this statue and we 'flew' into it through its belly button. Poppa and Dad were there. They opened this trapdoor as I went down. I ended up in a girl's toilet but I couldn't get into the shop. I tried to leave but this girl tried to take me and put makeup on me and I punched her. I kicked some other people and then left, running. I called Mom to get me. I was outside, and this group came out too. One of the people was Ezra and a really a fat kid. They attacked me and I was hitting them with a water bottle. I asked Ezra why he was with them. I said the girl was bad and that boys could do things (in poker and stuff and the girls would 'whip you'). Ezra dropped his Pokemon Diamond [though he has Pearl] through gaps in this bridge. Mr Billings got in and brought it up and it was ok. Then they left me alone and Mom came.
