Wild ride in a car along ocean and thru tunnels. At end of a long tunnel the car ends on a stone landing and almost careens into the water. We were able to stop in time! Shift: Sitting in a cafe next to an old windmill which was slowly rotating, the implication being that I should learn from it to slow down.
