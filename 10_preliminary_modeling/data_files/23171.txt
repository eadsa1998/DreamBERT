We were vacating our house, and people were coming to look at it.  It was in pretty bad condition.  Particularly noticeable were the tracks where ivy had been pulled off of the front door, and all kinds of dried detritus from vegetation which had been in the bedroom.  Someone also suggested that we cut a hole in the front door and install a doorknob there.
