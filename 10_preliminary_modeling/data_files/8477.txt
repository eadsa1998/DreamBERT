I was working at my computer. I'm not sure if I was at the CAS office or at home or if I was doing CAS work, schoolwork, or something else. The impression that I have right now is that I had a number of Excel spreadsheets that had lists of things that I can best describe as characteristics or issues. For example, if I were writing something I might want to make a bulleted list of factors, characteristics, issues, etc that apply to or help to describe what I am writing about. It was information that anyone could use - not necessarily related to business or profession. There were then also separate, singular words that I can't even decide if they were written down somewhere, if I was viewing them on the computer or if they were just in my mind. There were two separate sources of the lists and of the singular words respectively. I was seeing the mental connection between the two, how one word was a perfect fit for one list, another word a perfect fit for another list and so on. So, for example, the list associated with communication were things that would help people to understand more about communication and could help them become much more effective communicators. They definitely felt like insights that would be knew to most people - not written about before. The more connections I made the more excited I became. Also, it felt almost like one of those things that I classify as things that you don't know that you know - it's as though seeing it or hearing it brings it to the conscious mind. I was sitting there saying, Yes. Exactly. Of course. I knew this was very meaningful and going to be extremely useful to a lot of people. I was eager to share it with Bill C because I knew he would get it and really appreciate it.
