The first thing I recall in the dream is a group of people standing around the door leading into an apartment. The cause of the excitement was a jammed lock. There appeared to be a number of dollar bills jammed in the lock that prevented its proper functioning. I managed to extricate the bills and get the lock working again. The next thing I recall was a living room full of relatives discussing something, but I don't know what they were discussing now. The scene then shifted to a kitchen. Here I remember having had a discussion with a cousin, who lives here in Cleveland and not in my hometown where the other relatives in the dream live. My discussion with my cousin consisted of a series of commentaries by him of people he knew but whom I did not know.
