J_____ (a girl friend of mine), A_____ (her brother), and I were in a small city waiting to get a bus to N_____ city. We were riding down the main street of the town in a street car headed for the bus station. We saw great crowds of people in the streets. We found out that there was to be a St. Patrick's Day parade. We hoped that the bus would not be held up because of that. We were supposed to meet a friend of A_____'s in the drug store but he wasn't there. Then we got out of the car, went in to the store and had something to eat. We then proceeded around the corner to wait for the bus. I saw G_____ - ( a boy I know in church) - waiting also. The bus came and we all got on. G_____ got on first and sat in a seat with someone else. I got on and saw an empty seat that held three people right across from G_____. I thought, "Good, now J_____, A_____ and I can sit together. However, G_____ got up and sat down next to me before J_____ and A_____ had a chance to get back there. I remember that I was anxious because they wouldn't be able to sit together now.
