I dreamed I was spending time with Mom, over days, socializing, and I felt after a while like I needed to be away from her.  I was more than annoyed, I really felt I needed to be away from her.  Also dreamed about living at the top of a steep hill, and trying to maneuver a U-Haul truck up there and into the driveway and garage.  Dreamed about the roads around this place, steep, back country, pine trees, and some of the people around there.
