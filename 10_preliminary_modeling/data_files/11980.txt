I was at the Royal Show. The first thing we saw was a "Pat-the-Penguin". It was a kangaroo in a penguin suit and we thought it was a penguin at first and then it was a person inside and we realized. I went to go into a separate part of the Royal Show. They said I had to be 15+ to go in by myself. But Mom came and I got in. It had all the waterslides and stuff. We left that bit and I went back and I was allowed in. I went into this toy shop and a lady from before said no people under 15 were allowed in. And she read out something about "no smelly girls or boys under 15". And I said I am 15. She said "Oh. When's your birthday?" and I said "25 January 1990". Then she asked me what term I was in. But I didn't get it at first. Then she asked when Baby Day was. I was like "How should I know?" Then I said today, because I had seen a poster with a mother and a baby. I was right. I was then backstage somewhere. I was there with some people from school. Also people were building a building over the water and Mom and I almost fell. Jocelyn and I were also walking around somewhere near the penguin thing. Also something someone had was ultra rare but I can't remember.
