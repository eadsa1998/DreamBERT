["Killer woman after me."] I and another woman are on the side of the road. A highway. We sense the presence of a killer woman who wants us dead. The other woman quickly gets into the car and drives away to safety. I look around for escape and see a toy car. I stand on it with my right foot, I try to get my left foot on it too but that foot won't cooperate. So I use the big toe of my right foot to push the toggle switch which drives the tiny car. As we are racing down the highway, I see the killer woman is closing in on me. She 's going to run me down and squish me. I dart over the edge and into the grassy verge and hide. She races over me,. I narrowly miss being killed. Now I turn the car and race across the farm fields. Past farm buildings. Then I am in the seedy part of a small town, a maze of black dark streets and alleys. The woman is close behind me. I am in fear of my life.
