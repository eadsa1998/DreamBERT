I remember another long period of dreaming. First I ask someone for a cigarette, although I don't smoke. Then I am in a car and my grandfather is driving, I believe to McDonalds. He keeps changing lanes and into places that aren't really lanes. Then we're on a bridge with water on both sides and I'm scared the car might go into the water. We get to McDonalds and asks me if, "we need to get ketchup and mushrooms?" (mushrooms, not mustard). I didn't pick up that half-rhyme until I woke up. But then, I'm in McDonalds and he expects me to order for him (I suppose he's in the car waiting). I don't have any idea what he wants.
