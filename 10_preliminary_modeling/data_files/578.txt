I am fighting all night long with a woman. Two men, two women and my husband and I are going out together. A parade is going on. Some kind of a picnic or something. We fight both before and after the event. We are also in some big church and spooky things are happening and one woman is suspected of causing them. At one part we have to get to the choir loft and there are no stairs. It seems I am the cause of the trouble. There is a lot of grey in the dream. There is a fight on the second floor of a building that is like a city hall. Events are going on in town at the same time. Also the fight happened as we are about to eat. We end up agreeing to disagree but the matter is settled. Someone gets a piece of soap and says it is from a local art gallery where they sell fancy soaps.
