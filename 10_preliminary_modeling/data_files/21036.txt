Seabecke was telling us what a fair deal he was giving us. I watched him thru a tube like. He came into our dept. The boys walked by him and said hello. I took a stroll by him and did the same. I was looking at a paper and saw three Johns and a Walter and I showed them to Walter. I saw Mabel L. I owned a big building. The basement was full of stores that were rented. I walked thru there and there were all kinds of stores there and ritzy and poor and colored people. I gave a colored lady a lift to her home with her groceries. There was a dog that was 14 years old and would run after everyone. The owner grabbed him when I walked by because he was ready to run after me. I saw had in the 2nd. We were going to play with pigeons. I said, "They won't fly away because they come back."
