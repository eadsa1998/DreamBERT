I am at a shop/library. A good-looking man is attracted to me. I am trying on different hats. One is an old leather brown flying pilot helmet. It looks silly on me. I hear Rochelle going by. She is talking about her hormones. She always talks like that. I don't want to make any noise so she'll know I'm there and come over and talk. Boring. I am going to connect with this delicious man.
