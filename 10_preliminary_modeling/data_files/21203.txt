I was in a field with Barbara and Audrey. I looked up and saw rain coming and it was close. I got hold of Audrey and Barbara, picked them up and ran for home with them. This was in Rivertown. I was loving Ann. We were walking at night and someone started to whistle. We knew someone was there, so we turned around and I saw a dog coming our way. I thought it was a spook. I made a sign of a cross and he just went by us paying no attention to us. I saw a rabbit run under a porch. We went hunting and when we got to the field, it dawned on me we had no guns or hunting clothes. I was in Rivertown. I parked by Belches and I noticed my lights were blinkers and my car started to move down the grade. I got in and stopped it. Then I parked it near the store and a level grade.
