My dancing teacher and I were dancing. We were in the dancing studio. It was very realistic. I could feel the bare floor under my feet. We were dancing to "I'd like to get you on a slow boat to China," which we call our song. All of a sudden I pulled away and went over and shut off the music (there's a big panel against the wall and you just punch a button and get any kind of music you want). And I said, "I'm going to go home" and he said, "Why?" and I said, "Well, I'm not coming back here any more, you annoy me." And then all of a sudden, near the machine there was a little depression like an alcove in the wall. This alcove had a slanting seat, like a chaise lounge, built right into the wall. And he said, "Oh, no, you're not," and he pulled me over and kissed me and just as he kissed me, the dancing master walked in.
