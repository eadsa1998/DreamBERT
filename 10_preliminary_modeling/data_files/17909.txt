I was in school, sitting in a lecture hall.  It was near the end of the quarter.  I was trying to get my work done, as it was due soon.  Then the next class came and I moved back a row.  I realized I was missing a paper and thought I'd left it at my seat, so as the next lecture started I asked my father, who was sitting a few seats to my left, to reach up and grab it.  He did, but the one I saw was "Matthew's" not mine.  I asked him to reach up again and I think he got the right one.  I was worried though; there was still a 10-page paper I had to write for another class that I had completely forgotten about.  I was in trouble.  Then my boyfriend Jeremy and I were in a parking lot.  There were two toilet seats vertical.  I had to pee, and was trying to figure out how to go in this vertical toilet.  Jeremy was being sort of amorous and wanted me to sit on his lap, but I still had to pee.  He told me to go between his legs.  I tried, but I couldn't, I was too afraid of making a mess.
