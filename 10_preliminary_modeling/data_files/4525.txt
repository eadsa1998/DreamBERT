["The Tom Sawyer dream."] I am in a large house, lots of people. (Like Uni house) The parents left for a while. (a week). So no one cleans up. The long tables in the dining hall are covered with dirty dishes. I come in and say someone should clean this up. Everyone just ignores me. It's too big a job, overwhelming. I'm cheerfully picking up a plate and a fork and go to the sink with them. I fill it with hot soapy water and begin scrubbing the dried food off the dishes. It is hard work but I continue cheerfully to do the dishes, one at a time. I keep asking people to help. I make jokes and try to make it fun. After awhile, someone starts helping. We playfully make a game out of it. More people come and help. Now everyone is helping and things are getting cleaned up. Sorority women come in and are disdainful. We ignore them and look like we are having fun. (Because we are!) Soon, they help too. Then a punk teen boy says he's not going to help. His clothes are dirty, so I grab him and wash him like I'm hand-washing clothes. I am vigorous and the poor guy yelps as I thrash him around in the sink. I see lots of filthy water come out of the clothes. That will do. I say, and release him.. Now he's willing to help.
