Others my age and I were being held in a camp which was at home. We all planned to escape and we were put into two groups -- the cows and the locusts. I was in the latter. We climbed over the garage and ran. This guy and I ran up the hill and hid behind a bush. I suggested it would look less dodgy if we were walking. Ezra called telling me to escape. I saw Mom's car and they had others in the car and we got in. We drove away. There was a Pseudo Echo St and Listening was playing on the radio. I said we weren't bad guys. I thought Mom was taking us back but she took us to a restaurant. Then I needed to pee. There were two little 'pee booths' and when you flushed it went into someone's mouth (there was a pub thing underground). The guy I was with called someone and I'd translated what he said, working out that he was bad. We went into this cinema. Two kids were taking food from the back room. I took a Milky Way. Mom, Ezra and others found it and they were taking stuff. The staff were coming and I warned them. I snuck out and asked the staff where the toilet was so it would seem like I was an innocent bystander, and then we had to make clothes to go to another camp. I wanted to escape.
