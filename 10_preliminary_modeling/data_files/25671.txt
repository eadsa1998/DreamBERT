 I'm with my aunt and uncle Rusty and Sheila Redding, and their kids Rich, Melissa, and Melvin. I'm hugging a toilet bowl. I say, "It's all about ceramic toilet bowls." Rusty says, "It's all about licking heads." He licks my head, and then Sheila's. We all have dinner. I open a box wrapped with green paper after dinner. There are some dessert bars inside. I eat one. It crumbles as I try to eat it. The box was supposed to go to my aunt Raquel Redding. It had my mom Natie's name on it, short for Natalie, so I thought it was for my mom. She wouldn't mind if I opened it. Rusty, Sheila, my mom, and others see that I opened it. This is a terrible thing for me to do. I wasn't supposed to open the box. There is no way to repack the box. People are mad at me. I feel guilty and shameful. My sister Ramona washes the dishes, though she doesn't want to. I'm in my room upstairs at home. Rich and I might play chess. Rusty comes up also. Something happens with stuffing a closet. I'm then in the kitchen. I'm drinking alcohol, smoking cigarettes, and taking some garbage out to the garage. Someone comments on my smoking a cigarette. I say I've only smoked 10 cigarettes in my life. An ash from the cigarette lands on the gas tank of the lawnmower. The lawnmower explodes. I run into the kitchen and close the door. There are several loud bangs and explosions. A fire breaks out. People come quickly with fire extinguishers. There was a direct telephone line to the police or fire department so they will be coming even though the fire has been put out.
