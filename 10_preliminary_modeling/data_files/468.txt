I was in a room where someone was giving birth. It was a character from General Hospital. Carly was receiving a C-section. Two other characters from General Hospital, Alan Quartermane and Monica Quartermane, were giving Carly this operation. These two people happen to hate Carly, so as I watched, I thought it was odd they were doing the operation. Carly asked if her baby was all right and the two doctors said yes, but gave each other side-glances, like they were lying to her. They were planning to kidnap the baby. Then two African-American males were walking around the hospital arguing because they were lost. Whenever I saw these two, they were always walking away from me. They seemed out of place characters, like they were from another TV show and weren't supposed to be on the set of General Hospital. They were overacting the whole time they were in my dream. Then I was in the reception area of a hospital and the receptionist was called away. Then I saw someone tip over a container filled with tarantulas.
