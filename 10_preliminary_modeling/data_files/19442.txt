It was the morning of Carla's birthday. It was 10:00am and her party was to start at 11:00am, and I had not yet gone shopping for the food. I rushed to the store with my mother. I couldn't remember how many hamburgers and hotdogs. Then I realized I didn't make the cake. So I saw them making the cakes and I saw one perfect for the party. The lady said I couldn't have it; it was for someone else. I asked if she could frost me one just like it. She went to work. I went back shopping. Then I got a call. The people were there to set up the air jumper, but they needed their money. I sent my mom back with the money. I got all I could remember. The cake got done and I rushed back to the house. People were already there. I had forgot the ice for the Sno Cone machine. My mom went to get some. The air jumper was set up and the kids didn't want to jump in it. I got the ice and made the Sno Cones but they didn't want any. I was upset. Nothing was going right.
