Nana and Poppa cleaned our house with Fluorine. It did stuff to your teeth if it got in your mouth. I used it for a bit and then my teeth started hurting. It felt like my teeth were covered in like that crackle stuff but lots of it and it hurt really bad if I bit down. I couldn't talk properly. I rinsed my mouth with water but it was still there. Later, I was ok and I was in the back room sitting on the floor holding a small baby. It was quiet and kept staring at me. It started to pee on my arm and I threw it onto the ground. It was now a black kitten and it started running around the room and I said that the baby was like a kitten. I called it 'Lily' [note: In Dawson's Creek they had a baby called Lily]. I told Mom to close the back door, but she didn't and it ran outside. I chased it and caught it and brought it back in.
