This person and myself are being chased by some people. We're on a city street looking for ways to hide. I think that I'll meditate and call upon my guru. I do so. He shows up and whispers, "Hey, over here," and walks away. I follow, looking around for the "bad guys." He then disappears. My friend says, "Oh! What a lovely woman is walking by," and I look to see my guru or I see an invisible nothing. I am quite agitated. I say, "This is all very nice and interesting, but can this magic stuff save our asses and get us out of here before we're hurt?" How are we going to get out of there safely? [BL]
