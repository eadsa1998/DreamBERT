I walk past a man and drop eye contact. As I enter my room, I realize he could be a nice guy and I never gave him a chance. So I go back and smile. He comes in and hugs me. Then we look around the room. There are lots of snapshots put together like an art collage on the walls. He says I'm very good at my art. (I say, "Oh, I like to use repetition of pictures to make a point and some things just happened intuitively, not planned.") He points to one where the kids look like they are sliding down a waterfall. There are also lots of clothes piled up in the sink. I start sorting them. The baby things I put in a pile to save for the next grandchild. I hang up the blouses in an already crowded closet. I see an apple pie and think, "Oh good, but I'd better eat it." I see some chocolate chip cake stuff in the sink and feel a little annoyed that Arvonne has these goodies (with sugar) and I can't and she's wasting food.
