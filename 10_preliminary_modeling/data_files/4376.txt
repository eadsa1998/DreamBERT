["Trying to teach."] I am in a large room where some presentations will be occurring. I will be part of the teaching team, but I am not prepared. Charla and I are trying to locate and organize my notes. It is a very small audience, at one point it looks like maybe there are only participants, no audience. What is the point then of doing the presentation? I am looking for my notes, wishing I had prepared better. I am teaching counseling or communication.
