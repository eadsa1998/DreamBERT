I awoke to find I had been sleeping next to a dead man. I went to another part of the house and when I returned, the body was gone. A strong man about 40 came and asked another man where the body was. The man said he put it on the sand pile. I was worried that I would get into trouble with the police if the body was found. I had recently gotten into trouble with the police.
