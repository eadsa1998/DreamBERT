I met a dark-haired woman about my age. We fell in love and kissed secretly in a downstairs room of her house. We had to keep out of sight of her mother. Her mother came in upon us, and she was angry about my advances. She said, "I know what kind of place you came from. Girls in bikinis." I replied that she had misjudged me.
