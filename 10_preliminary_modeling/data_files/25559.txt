 I'm in hallways, laundry rooms, and corridors. I move about on skates or roller blades. I see my relatives that are getting ready for my cousin Steve Redding's wedding. I'm in Grandpa and Grandma Redding's old farmhouse. I see my cousin Jessica Redding, my aunt Annette Colby, and my uncle Adam Redding. Others and I are then at church for the wedding. It's hot: I'm sweating in my clothes. I talk to my cousin Archie Weber about school. He is almost done with school: has one semester left. He needs to take chemistry, physiology, and one other course. I walk by my childhood priest Father Vance Brock, who is with my grade school classmate Misty Ryan and her mother Leslie. He says, "Hi Kenneth." I say hi back and wave. I wouldn't have done so if he didn't first. My uncles Gary and Dannie Redding are in the wedding. I am with my mom and sisters Ramona and Heather. We sit on the right side of church, in back, saving a place for our cousin Melissa Redding. I get out of my seat to do something in back of church, maybe in the balcony. The wedding has started with the procession. My aunt Annette and aunt Elaine Grains are singing. I have trouble getting up to the balcony without having family members seeing me leave. I can't get to the doors. Then I do make it to the balcony. When I come down, my jeans, which are later black pants, are stuck or pinned together. I waddle down the steps. The choir is there as I go down. There is a reception at the American Legion. I ask, "Is it safe yet?"
