I live in a house that I am sharing with other people. I am in the kitchen which is very crowded with lots of people trying to cook their breakfasts. Josh is making comments that imply incompetencies to his wife. I say to him, "Be careful. You could get in trouble." I feel strange interfering with their business. He comments that people are managing with powdered eggs and milk.
