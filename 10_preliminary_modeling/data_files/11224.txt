The dream began as I opened up a hotel room door. Inside the room sat a beautiful young blonde who was not recognizable to me. As I entered, she rose and walked over to me, and just as I was about to kiss her the scene changed. Then I found myself running towards a large crowd gathered in an unfamiliar crowded street. I pushed through to the center of the crowd and found my lost dream girl lying there injured by a hit skip driver. I then sat down beside her took her in my arms to comfort her and woke up.
