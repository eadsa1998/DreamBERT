I was walking out of the apartment in which I live and I noticed that the people in the basement suite were moving. I went to the janitor's wife and inquired about the suite. She told me that it was available, but she had another one on the 3rd floor, number 18, which I might like. We went up to see it. (In real life, the suite is directly above my own suit, but is number 17.) She opened the door and I was astounded by the vastness of the rooms (again, in real life the rooms in the building are all very small). The rooms were ultra-modern. I was very pleased to take the apartment, but my husband then came up and said no. Mrs. Beals was very nice and pleasant.
