I was in the house. Ann an Audrey were outside with the dog. We had a big dog. I came out thru the side door and Ann sent the dog in for me. He didn't know me. I was out late. It was about 5 o'clock in the morning. We had a small baby sitting in a high chair and I was surprised. She was singing to the music on the radio. She would say the words ahead of the radio.
