I have a feeling that something happened before this part of the dream, but I cannot remember it. I was in the deep water in the swimming pool at the Tudor Arms where I have a swimming class. I was holding on to the edge. A boy I knew in second grade and met again later in junior high at a young people's group and who is 19 now and a student at Case and goes steady with a girl he met at the church we go to - was standing beside the pool and helped me out. I went down the steps to the elevator as he walked down the way to the shower room and I said I would see him downstairs. The next thing I knew I was getting in his car, a small coupe, and he put both arms around me and I leaned my head on his shoulder. I was tired after swimming and it felt good to be there.
