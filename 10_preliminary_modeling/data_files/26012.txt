 I'm in a house which later seems to be my grandparents farm. Two people are dead. One is a very skinny woman. The other may be my friend Kevin Simpson, but Kevin may be the person trying to revive the second dead person. I try to revive the skinny woman. A woman is also doing this. A third person may be reviving Kevin, or Kevin may be reviving them. The skinny woman's arms seem to be nonexistent, like they are glued to her sides. Her body is stiff and cold. I do the Heimlich Maneuver and the other woman tries CPR. The dead woman is deathly thin: her waist looks like it about 15 inches around, and her body is nothing. If you push on one part of her stomach the contents of her stomach will move: there is nothing over them but a layer of skin. The dead woman has an erection, full of blood. Her other body parts may or may not be full of blood. She coughs: she is alive! Kevin comes alive as well! Both of them were dead: they had no pulse. I cradle the woman's head in my lap. She has had a near death experience in which she saw a red light. I tell her gently that she can't go back. We get up. There is a spirit of non-appreciation in the air, as if I have done the woman a disservice by saving her life. I talk with people there. My friend Stephen may be the one who indicates I have done a disservice. <br/
