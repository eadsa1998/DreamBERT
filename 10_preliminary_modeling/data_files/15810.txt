I was with a couple of friends - a girl and Jack O'Neill. Jack was a little bit flimsy and a bit of a ladies man, flirting with pretty much everyone. We were in a shop or bar or something, and a guy friend of his went a bit crazy - a friend of his who was gay and who had a crush on him (we were presuming, I think). He was on the ground and Jack lay down next to him and kissed him and they made out. We all stood around awkwardly and I was secretly enjoying it (the kissing, not the awkwardness). Later we were outside the building and there were some girls there and my female friend pointed out that he was averting their eyes. I 'rewound' and noticed his eyes would flicker down and not look at them. She proposed that he was making an effort to not flirt with all the ladies as she'd pointed out to him some time earlier. I wondered if perhaps he was confused after that kiss, or maybe it was just nothing. The female friend also had this weird hair, which had this high bit in the middle full of interesting colours (that were like, shiny and vibrant blues, not a flat hair dye blue), and the sides were deep black. I asked if I could touch it and it was hard like from mousse and I said 'aw, I was hoping it'd be fluffy'. I also thought she may have had a crush on Jack (as did I). At some point Dad and I were at this takeaway restaurant and I ordered something different from the usual and he was shocked.
