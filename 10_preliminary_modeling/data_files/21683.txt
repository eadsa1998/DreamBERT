I saw Know This. He ran 3rd. We seemed to have moved into another house and it was full of small snakes. I was stepping and tramping on them, killing them. There were hundreds of them. We would put out the lights for a while, then put them on again and the snakes would come out and we would start stomping them to death. A small boy sat in a boat. It was drifting out into the water. I picked up a pole and tried to reach him. As I did, waves began to come in and it moved the boat out of reach. The mother screamed, I jumped into the water, big waves started to come in and I swam for my life to get to shore and I made it. I was supposed to marry a 15-year-old girl. I went to church with John Yankura, but I didn't get married. There was a good harvest of a fruit of some kind. I can't recall what it was, but we took it home. I saw Grapevine One or #1 was supposed to win the first or last race. I don't know which race. Ed, the fellow from White's with a hand missing, came into Andy Palider's store and said to Andy, "Boy, Obsession is a sure winner. I would put my whole pay on him." I said, "No horse is a sure thing. He can fall and break his leg." I was loving up Andy's clerk. She wanted to be loved, so I was kissing and caressing her. I had a hard-on and she said, "It's hard to. I think if I spread my legs, you would put it in," and I said, "I don't know; I never did this before." Then some customer came in and a lady wanted to see something that she had to go and show her. I went out and came later, and I peeked around the corner and she saw me. I went in and we sat on a chair for two. I was loving her when two lady customers came in and they remarked, "Look how red his face is. He is blushing." I don't know if I was, but Andy was standing near and he was blushing.
