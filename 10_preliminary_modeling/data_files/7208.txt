I asked his wife if I could see J. "He is talking with two men." I will wait. She didn't seem to want me to ...I asked J. if I could go with him and the other man. So I followed. It seemed as if we got into a small boat, yet we were walking. ...A man and I hid in a vacant house but one day a furniture van came and we knew we would have to leave. We went to make plans. One of the men on the truck said we could go in here so we went in by the closed door. (July 8-12 dreamed but forgot as I woke.)
