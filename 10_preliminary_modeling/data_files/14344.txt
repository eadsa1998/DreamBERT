I was at some meeting thing and we had made food. This lady had some chicken thing and it looked really nice and I told her that. Later, I couldn't find my iPod and I realized I'd left it in her bag. I went to her house and broke in with someone else. I wanted a game off her computer so I plugged in the iPod to transfer it but I had trouble finding it. She came home and I got my friend to stall her. She left again though and I just left after that, without the game.
