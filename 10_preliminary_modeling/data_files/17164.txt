I was a Jewish man.  I had a cross-stitched shirt by my daughter.  I was in the garage of a neighbor's family.  Like sitting on the steps of our garage leading into the kitchen.  I wrote with chalk on what looked to be a chalkboard, called a Grimwald board.  (For Crayons only).  My daughter told me this, I believe, after I'd returned home.  I snuck back into the house to try to erase what I'd written so I wouldn't get in trouble.  There was a monkey on the shelf the family was going to fix for dinner.  I told him to hide in the attic.
