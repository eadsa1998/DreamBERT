I was planning the order of countries to visit on our trip to Europe. I was talking with some girls who said it was hard to take different airlines because of weight limits. I went outside and I had money on a brick wall. A girl walked past and told me to be careful with my money and then took some. I chased her and took some back. Some of my stuff was also on the wall -- a shirt and a pair of pants were folded with a gun on top. A guy next to it had a gun too. I walked past and looked back and he was pointing the gun in the other direction and would randomly shoot. Then he turned my way and I dodged a bullet and ran. I ran into a building which didn't have many people in it and went to the back room. There were some kids in there and I locked the door. I went to this office out the back locked myself in there, but somehow saw him smash into the other rooms. I broke a wall which lead to the entrance and ran out with him following me. Then Meg Ryan wagged a wallet in his face and he took it and left me alone. I thanked her and she said 'no problem, my father blah blah blah' -- she was a rich girl. There were cars burnt under the sand. I tried to take a photo of Simba but my phone froze and I complained, saying I needed to get an iPhone 4. I ended up with Jessica (True Blood) and her toes turned purple and this big muscly guy said "toe toe". I told her she had to get somewhere. There were people around that were like Sims and had wishes that you could complete. Jessica's one wouldn't complete and her new mission was to have sex with Tara (True Blood) and 7/10 fantasies. I dragged her into this place and said 'she will' and I heard a 'buh buh' sound.
