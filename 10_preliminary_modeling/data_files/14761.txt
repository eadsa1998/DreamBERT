Sylar (Heroes) was killing people for their powers again, but he was sometimes John Lithgow and sometimes me. He was in a carpark and the cops were looking for him. He grabbed a kid and walked off (to look like a parent and not get noticed). He went into a building and he knew who had what power, but couldn't do so much at once. He would use mindreading to make everyone not nice. He went into a shop and this girl said the money was in the back (to give to him when he returned someone). He went to get it and went crazy again. He cut open some snake looking thing and was trying to convince people that it didn't hurt it. There was a dog cut open and he cried saying that when he returned it he would get money for being a hero, but it was hard for him.
