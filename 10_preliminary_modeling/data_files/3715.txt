At first I am with strange beings, perhaps aliens, or spiritual beings or simply another planet. Things are done differently there. I must get used to the terrain. I am then called out of bed and outside to rehearse a disability skit with perhaps Bonnie. She holds my hands as she is up high on a cardboard box and I am down below calling to her. I am pulling at her and falling down. I ask her loudly why we don't have accessibility yet. "How long has it been since 1983 when it was law and we still don't have it?" I then pause and suggest to her we do this skit out on the parking lot where people could actually see it. She doesn't want to and I drag her out there, cardboard box and all. This is going to annoy the bosses of the place I work at, a car dealership or manufacturing place. The personnel office is looking for me now. A man questions me and wants to know if I know what cars they sell. I say, "The 2400 (something) does really well. And in the used cars we sell lots of Pontiacs." Then I start to travel through the rooms, which are full of shoebox-sized cardboard boxes all piled loosely on top of each other. How I travel is to step into a box and move to the next pile of boxes, like I go through a door into a room. A phone rings and the office people ask me another question. Then they want to know if Carmen Jones is there. I say, "Just a minute," and look in the next room where a light-colored black man is sitting in a manual wheelchair (like in movie I saw yesterday called Inside Moves). I ask him if he is Carmen Jones. He says, "Yes."
