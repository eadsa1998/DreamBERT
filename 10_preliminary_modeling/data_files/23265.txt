I am at a relative's house-maybe my son Burt's, I'm not sure.  Uncle Albert arrives.  I am glad to see him.  I ask about his car and he points to it out the window.  It is hard to tell which one he is pointing at, but I finally realize it is a big vehicle that looks like a small version of a motor home.  He and I get in an elevator to go somewhere.  This elevator does not go up and down but sideways.  It picks up speed, and I fear that we are going too fast to be able to stop at the end, and assume we will die.  He estimates that we are going 250 mph.  Somehow we do stop safely, however, and we get out.  After walking a short ways we meet John Kerry and Bertrand Therber playing basketball in the lobby of a building.  They invite me to join them, and I am glad to do so but comment that there is no net.
