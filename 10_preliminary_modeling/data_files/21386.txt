My son came into the house to ask for something. I yelled, "No!" to him and I knew he had a gun. I was upstairs and he was downstairs. I locked the door when he came up. He knocked on the door and demanded a box of 22s. I got my gun out and was prepared if he would shoot. Someone gave him the 22s and he went out. I watched him go and with a man and a boy. I was driving my car and I turned to get away from it. A fellow was putting up a platform for me to drive up into the passage. We were eating and there were two bugs that went down into the food. I finally got one on the floor and I stomped him down with my bare foot about 20 times before I killed him. There was one more in the bowl down under the food. I saw a paper and names of horses that won races. One was a short name. I can't recall it. I was on a hill. I picked up an apple and threw it very high and far, near the people that were walking by.
