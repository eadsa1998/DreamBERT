Woke up at 10:30 and finished breakfast. Went over to Mrs. I's. (I was looking for her until school reopened. I was in Salida, Colorado then.) In bedroom slippers and winter coat. Found a neighbor woman and Mrs. I, who was sick, bundled up in quilts, etc. Glimpses of two men in underwear hurrying to dress. Sounds of child being spanked. Went back to finish dressing. Found children back on return but not their parents. . Tried to find out who had brought them. Called boy Jimmy. Seemed to be own niece and nephew (nephew's name was really John), although looked like Gibbon's children. Coasting with J. R. and L. Had to hurry back for it was 8 a.m. and I had to be at school at 8:30. (This J. favorite brother, R. older sister.)
