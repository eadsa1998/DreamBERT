 I'm in a class (maybe biology), taking a test. Part of the test is timed. The question I'm working on has me completely dumbfounded: I just don't know the answer at all. I run out of time and also leave another question unanswered. I'm not too concerned about that, I just leave it. People talk about how they ran out of time on the test, implying they could answer the questions with more time. For me, more time wouldn't have mattered: I didn't know the answer. There seem to be some sort of drill, maybe a fire drill, where people leave the building. This is not a true emergency: people are very lax about it.
