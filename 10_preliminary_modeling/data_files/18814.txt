In the first part of this dream, I had a date with a Negro girl, along with two other guys. It seems we were doing something for the civil rights movement. My date, I remember, had long, dark brown hair. We passed one movie house playing "El Cid" (I haven't seen it) and went to another one playing something like El Al-Solero. We decided to go to a different theater, however, because we didn't like the looks of the movie much. The next thing I remember was something about a war on cigars by the Europeans. It seems that they liked being able to travel with lower air fares, but that they didn't like cigar smokers on the planes. I guess I read this. Then I remember looking through a magazine and seeing an advertisement for a bicycle. To qualify, one had to take a test, which was sponsored by the Boy Scouts. They said to only write in if you thought you were #1. There would be more than one winner in NYC area and other cities. The last part of the dream involved a song by Ricky Nelson. In it, he was trying to get a girl who seemed to be his sister to leave a wild party "gang-bang." I remember him singing. The singing and music were good and I thought that it would do well because it would appeal to all girls who wished they had an older brother to protect them. Then the song went on and Ricky, still singing, got involved in a fight with this girl's date. Ricky, however, seemed to be enjoying it and baiting the guy on. He was doing this as I woke up.
