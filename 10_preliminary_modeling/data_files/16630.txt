We had chickens agob. We had three or four chickens, and four or five geese that were like the geese from the park. They made for quite the menagerie of pets. It was the same thing again, I was thinking how I hoped I wouldn't forget to feed them. This time, we had just gotten them. I was sitting in the yard, and they were coming around me, and I was making a mental note how I'd have to remember to feed them. Not only that, I felt an immense responsibility to protect them if any of those crazy raccoons or opossums came around.
