Later dream - Mike and I went up to a lookout above here, in the rocks.  We met two girls and I realized they were doing drugs.  I thought, now I can recognize if someone is on drugs.  It is easy to hide, but I could see a few signs that they were.  I thought, now I can tell, but I could see how you could conceal it, and no one could tell.  We talked with them about why they did drugs.  They gave many reasons.  We were on the rocks or walking about on the rocks.
