 I'm walking westward down a road that seems to be 1st Street North in Oak Valley. There is a little water on the side of the road with some weedy much. I'm with several people-maybe my dad and my sister Ramona. My friend Kevin Simpson is a few steps behind us. He makes a cast with a fishing rod to the right side of the road in a few inches of water. Immediately a fish strikes his lure. It must be a bass, I think. I'm playing the fish. It's a nice fish. I'm near a dock on a lake. My dad has landed the fish. It's a big northern pike, about five pounds or so. I have a camera, and I take a photograph of it. The fish is back in the water to be released. I grab its tail and move it back and forth in the water, reviving it. It swims away. I'm in the water. I have lost hold of a shotgun. As I flounder in the water I bump into it as it sinks down in the water. I grasp for it and grab it, glad that I've not lost it. There seems to be a swimming pontoon there.
