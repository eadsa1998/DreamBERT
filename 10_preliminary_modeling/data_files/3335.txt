I am traveling on a special highway or freeway where it is electronically fixed so that all vehicles go on it. There are planes and trains and cars. There is no gas and exhaust and so the vehicles are bumper to bumper. I have my face near the muffler of the vehicle ahead of me and not fumes. It's great. I think we are headed for Mexico. Ginny is around, helping me out. I have trouble walking because of the arthritis. She's helping me choose my clothes and helping me change them. Now I'm on a beach and people are feeling very sad for me because of my pain and arthritis. They want to help me. I sit on a blanket. Now a man shows me a rifle. I aim it out toward the surf. People are playing out there. The man says, "Be careful." As a joke, I point and say, "I got one." He says, "What did you shoot?" I say, "A surfer." Now I am with a man who plays music and I have a small snare drum with a crocheted yarn thing on it and I play it with my fingers, making a soft snare drum with a brush sound. He likes it with his banjo music. He asks me if he should sit farther away so people can hear me too. I say, "It's OK if they don't hear me." Now we are in separate cars driving down the freeway and Abner is my helper. I say it'd be nice if we could play the music together, not in separate cars. The music man then finds a tractor and he says, "Look, we can both sit on it." There is another man, an agent for the music man. Now we're on tour in our tractor and I see posters on a wall. One tells how many millions of dollars we've made, because we're so successful. The agent says to Abner, whose name is Roy Ward now, that he should change his name. Someone else famous already has that name. Roy won't change it. It is his name. I look at the posters and say, "Look, other people have acts involving food and music too." One is about cheese.
