We got into the car and Mom and Darren were in the front with Ezra in the middle of them and Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles were in the back with me. Darren called my phone and I'm Henry VIII started playing. I complained about being squished in the back. Also, at some point we went to pet shop and it was late. We knocked on the window and they let us in. They had ugly dogs. We were asking for help with some weird pet. Later, I was at a party with Jensen. We left (it was late and dark) and we both fell over on the path. He told me to go ahead to the car. I walked down the path and there were some others too, but then I was by myself. It was spooky. There was a fence right next to the path and I looked over it and I saw Jensen getting taken into an ambulance. I went to the carpark and I somehow got into a fight with this guy. He got into his car and I pretended my car was a different car and he slammed into it and then parked to get out. I got into my car, quickly put the keys in the ignition and reversed out. He realized and reversed back out. He missed me and I drove part, driving fast and crazy to get away from him. I got home (or somewhere). We had a shop and I saw that it was messy. I unlocked it and there was a note from the guy and a cake with powder/flour to make it messy.
