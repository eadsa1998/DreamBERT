I went to Mom's. It started raining and I ran to the door. There was a package and it was Pokemon Diamond and Pearl. The door wasn't fully closed and I pushed it open. I was like "Uh... ma?" She looked and there was a guy at the top of the stairs. We ran behind Mom's car and I was hugging my game. The guy took Mom's car and I was thinking 'Damn it, my CD!'. Then another guy came and we jumped in another car and locked the doors and were winding the windows up. I put the games in the back seat. Mom drove and he started chasing us. She lost control and we hit a woman and crashed through a fence. We were then at a hospital and Ezra had a bloody face. Dad had dropped him off at Mom's and he had gone to his room and the guy punched him in the face. I was at Mom's again and I remembered about my laptop. I said "Oh my God, my laptop!". I asked Ezra if they took our laptops and he said "I don't have a laptop" (meaning they'd been taken). I ran to my room and saw an empty desk. I started crying and fell to the floor. They took my external hard drive too. There was a phone had the peoples' number in it. I called him and was speaking in a Spanish accent. We both were talking silly and then I was threatening to kill him, but I didn't say it seriously. I went downstairs and Tiana, Gilbert and Classmate-F-19 were in a car. They talked to me and asked me about my laptop. [I woke up crying].
