I put this griptape thing in my mouth while I did something else but I coughed and it scratched the top of my mouth. I could taste blood and I looked in the mirror and there was a cut at the top/back of my throat and it was dripping down the back of my throat. I gargled some water and it felt like I was drowning and couldn't breathe. I spat it out and the water was red. I did it another two times and it was still bleeding and kept going down my throat. I woke up feeling like I was drowning [I was thirsty].
