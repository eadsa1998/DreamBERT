 I'm eating a Mexican dinner with a group of people. The red-haired woman with the injured back who likes Rudolf Steiner, from my Educational Psychology class is there. Also there is the woman with the reversible purse from the class, whom I think is a sick old hag. There are potatoes being eaten, among other things.
