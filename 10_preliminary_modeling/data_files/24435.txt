I am with my old unit in Vietnam. The order comes over the radio that we are now finished with jungle patrols. The Lieutenant makes it official and we silently begin to disband. Suddenly, a civilian, an older man in a suit, emerges from a tent. He speaks to us. "If my son can't go, no one goes." Then he shoots and kills my good friend Jerry B. I am overwhelmed and unload several shots at him. Nothing happens. Then, with an unusually long burst of automatic from my M-16 I cut him down. As the others have walked off, I throw the gun down and follow after them. There is a feeling of complete freedom. In very high spirits Jim L. and I go to a supermarket and buy food. I am aware that I do not wear my steel helmet. The dream is repeated. This time I do the killing with a laser beam. The man is this time Parry, a medic from another company I did not like. He dies a slow and agonizing death.
