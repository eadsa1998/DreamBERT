I watch as Uncle Lionel tries to say goodbye to us as we are getting ready to leave. He wants to share his feelings, but is speechless, as it's not natural for him to do this. I feel empathy and go up to him and hug him. He seems very, very tall, like I was a child. I hug him and say, "I know you are afraid and you want to be well and you want me to be well," (and a third person, perhaps Dwight). I take a cough syrup-like medication. I feel very emotionally connected to Lionel.
