I was winning a lot of money on horses. I was stuffing it into my wallet. I played some Blue Sonnet or something similar. I was collecting money in church to be for someone whom was in need. I held out my hand instead of a basket and when my hand was full, I put it into my pocket. I was being chased for stealing that money, then I was the chaser. It was a small boy. I shot at him in the rafters. Then I finally captured him. I saw a lot of large bulls. I flew up before they started after me. I was climbing up and down walls after Julia Gibson and she was mad at me.
