Calvin and this girl were friends and we were somewhere. She was outgoing and the like. Se took us out down the street which was like in the city. There was some female singer performing a small concert around. You had to be over 18 but I didn't have my proof of age card and I told her. I went back home to get it and then walked back there alone. I walked in and there weren't many people. There were seats, but not many. Everyone seated had Pokemon cards. Calvin and the girl's seats were like 48-49 and mine was 60. Loren Dean was on the stage and I had thought about leaving, but thought I'd stay since Loren Dean was here. The female singer came on too. A girl went up to ask a question, but was nervous and asked "what's the most, uh, what's um, the most, what-what's the most serious thing you'd like to do?". The singer went to ask what she meant but she said she meant like 'serious music feeling'. She was annoyed at the nervous stuttering and said so and was like 'hey, you said feeling!'.
