There was this holiday thing on for something for school. There was a place which did 'enactments' and you could give them details and they would make it like that for you to experience. Raquel was going to it and since it was booked out, the school made up one with a similar place. We were at a shop; I remember seeing Calvin and Eugene there. There were lots of clothes racks. They said that it was going to be like a prison and the guards were like 'aliens' and looked rhino like. There were lots of toy packets, with guns, walkie talkies etc lying about. They said they were going to get this room organized by tomorrow and get rid of the clothes racks and put debris and the like in. I asked if the walkie talkies worked and they said they did. I opened a packet and gave one to Calvin and the others to the people behind me (the packet had four in it). It was like an iPod and I put it in my shoe. We were then all lining up and went through this door and we were told to kneel. I was excited and trying not to smile. They were calling people out to answer questions, one was "are there eight questions", the girl said "yes" and she was wrong and was sent off somewhere. I was telling Mom about it later. I was at home and Abigail and Brogan were in the kitchen. I didn't know why they were there.
