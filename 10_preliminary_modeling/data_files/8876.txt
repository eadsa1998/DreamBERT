Not everyone on this panel was British. It was a group of people, I think there were 12. They were supposed to be working together on a task, or accomplishing something. The British people on this panel were not eager to get the task accomplished because once they were finished they had to go back to their own country. They wanted to stay in the United States as long as possible. It doesn't seem like they're doing very much to try to be productive or to accomplish the task. I don't really know what the task was. However, each of them had to write a paragraph or two about whatever it was that they were supposed to be doing. There were two new people on the panel. The two new people had written their paragraphs and when they read them aloud they sounded like dating ads. This did not fit the purpose at all.
