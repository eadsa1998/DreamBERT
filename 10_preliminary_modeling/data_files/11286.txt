I was taking my girlfriend home on a bicycle; as I didn't know where she lived, I asked her for directions. She said drive straight down Payne Ave. until you come to a dead end, then turn right, go on for a short distance, and then turn left. We speeded down the bumpy road (made even bumpier by the fact that one side of the road was being torn up for repair purposes). We arrived at the dead end near a group of long, shabby looking shacks near the edge of a lake. As it was late at night, I was alarmed when I noticed that the lights were on in her house. I wondered whether or not her parents were waiting up for her. As we approached the front door, I noticed her sister sitting there on the stairs; as my girl friend opened the door, I could see a large group of people inside talking in a low murmur. My girlfriend greeted them cordially and entered, leaving me standing outside. As I had little else to do, I engaged myself in conversation with her sister. An old man came and stood near us silently for a while; then he asked in a friendly manner, who I was. Immediately I introduced myself to him and found then that he was my girlfriend's father.
