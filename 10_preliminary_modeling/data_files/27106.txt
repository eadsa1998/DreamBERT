I was walking along a street (I don't know where). I stopped as I saw a short distance in front of me a manhole with one of those wooden horses used by road workmen extending across it. A man was tied to it by his ankles and wrists much as a pig is tied for roasting. Suddenly there was a great cloud of smoke around the manhole and as I looked I saw that the man had been burned to death. One arm, his head and shreds of clothes remained on the wooden horse. It was hideous and as I looked away I saw two hospital attendants (males) approaching in the opposite direction. As they passed I saw two men lying on the stretcher side by side. I heard someone (I don't know from where) whisper "They are dead." It was such a nightmare that I woke up.
