I'm doing a 3-point turn in a cul-de-sac. I then park the car on one side. A nosey neighbor then comes out of his new-build to say "you shouldn't park there - it's on a slope." I look, but there's no slope - it looks flat to me. But at the end of the culled-sac there is a drop. It dropped away like a sheer cliff - there was no fence. I went off somewhere with my partner. I returned later and somehow my car had rolled off the edge of the road and 'on to' the top branches of a huge tree that was growing up from below (the tree top was level with the road).  My car was so tantalisingly near, but it would be dangerous to try to get into the car while it was balancing on the tree. The neighbor came out again, gloating. "I told you didn't I?" he said. "You won't get that car from here. You'll have to shake it out of the tree and get it from the bottom." For some reason I thought I could actually do that that, so I went down some steps and came to the base of the tree. What I didn't notice before was that the tree was growing up the side of a factory - a concrete carpark-like structure that seemed partially open to the sky. The tree hung over the factory. There were workers around. I shook the tree and to my surprise all sorts of large objects started falling out of the tree into the factory - pieces of masonry and plaster for example - some pieces of which landed on people on the factory floor. I was shocked and felt bad about it. I also dreamt a variation: instead of my car stuck in a tree, it's my converse trainers stuck on the factory roof. My partner's father risks his life by climbing out onto the roof (which is only partially constructed) to retrieve my trainers.
