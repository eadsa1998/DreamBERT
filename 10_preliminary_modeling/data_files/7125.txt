We were going to Hilo. Only 25 minutes left and I had to finish dressing and see the doctor. I open a door. A strange man is within. I apologize and tell him to go out, find Dr.'s office but he is not in. I must go to the beat; but what shall I do? I have no medicine and we'll be gone several days. Maybe I could write and ask him to sent the prescriptions.
