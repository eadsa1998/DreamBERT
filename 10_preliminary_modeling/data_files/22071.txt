I had found a friend whom I had not seen for many years in a grocery store that is not familiar to me, and we had been talking, but I don't remember what about (I had not seen this friend in over a year, but Sunday the 14th I had seen him and we had talked only briefly because he was in a hurry). We were in that grocery store when the guy who was assistant principal at the school where I went for the first three years of high school passed by driving his car (in the third year of high school I left the school due to problems with that gentleman, but my friend stayed in the school). I asked him whether this was Mr. O., because he was in a different car. He told me that it was him and that he has changed cars. Then I started to insult him and to make gestures at him with my hands, but he did not react to this.
