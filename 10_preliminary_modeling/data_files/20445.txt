I was in an auditorium. There were no chairs. I was wearing a brimless woolen hat. I took it off. My hair was thick and wavy. Some teenage boys standing nearby made disparaging remarks about my hair. (About seven years ago I tried to give myself a haircut, and it turned out uneven in some places. I boarded a bus a day or so after that, and two teenage boys were sitting behind me, and joked with each other about how my hair was cut. This may be related to my present attempts at self-analysis.) Later I was unable to walk for some reason, and a man who reminds me of someone I knew in the hospital named Goodhand or someone I knew in 1949 in a hospital, had to push me onto a stretcher. He wheeled me under a building and over some railroad tracks.
