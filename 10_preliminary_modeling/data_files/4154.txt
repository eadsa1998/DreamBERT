I am in a house with many many rooms. It used to be "my" house, and I am selling it to Abner. I realize that I mostly live in one or two rooms. I tell Abner there are some incredible rooms in this house... But I haven't used them in years. I am cleaning up to make ready for Abner to take over the house. I look out a window and see beautiful birds. Someone said look at the Thunderbirds. I see exotic colored birds, greens, spots of red and yellow. They are actually having sex. I see a huge white feathered bird that looks like an eagle. I'm not sure if it is alive. I go outside to speak to Abner. Howard is working in a garden. So is Abner, further up the path. Later some man and myself walk down a hill in a wooded area behind the house and enjoy the spacious beautiful area. Perhaps a river runs through it.
