Frank and a woman named "Cindy" are going to work on an opera workshop! Frank is waiting by the shore of a lake and Cindy arrives in a big square boat (looks like the Lady of the Lake of Lake Chelan, Wa.) --Church dinner in a garden: a big feast; I see huge amounts of food wrapped in Saran wrap, so it will stay warm; I eat yellow corn, cauliflower, fish steaks and a dessert; later I lick a delicious thick, blue dessert from my fingers one by one.
