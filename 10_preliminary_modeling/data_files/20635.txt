I was working someplace. I saw a collarbone come through someone's flesh. My mother said to come home right away. I ran south to catch a northbound bus. At the stop I reflected that I should have run northbound and caught the bus ahead of the one that was coming. The streets going east and west were numbered. I boarded the bus at 6th street. When I arrived home, my mother was waiting for me.
