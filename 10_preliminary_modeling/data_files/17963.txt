I was on a hotel vacation with my boyfriend Jeremy.  We were eating leftover bean burritos.  Mine was dripping hot oil onto my hand.  I thought if there was that much oil in it then the beans must have lard and can't be vegetarian.  I gave something away or knew something about a flower.  We were approached by two people telling us about a sales scam, where a $5 investment would yield $5000 profit.  I was skeptical but my boyfriend Jeremy was curious and wanted to listen to the couple's spiel.  Afterward they wanted us to try out the sales technique.  A couple happened to approach us, and we were supposed to try it on them before deciding.  The couple was informed though; they had done their research and they were already interested in the program, so there was actually no convincing involved.  As our first attempt was a success, it would be harder to get away from the scammers, they would have more ground to continue pushing us on.  Then a second couple came in, angry, and asking for their furniture back.  They had already been scammed and their furniture was being used as leverage against them.  Afterward we found out that they were a set-up; they had videotaped the transaction and were going to use it as evidence against the scammers.  I picked up the $5 from the first couple and was going to give it to the, but they told me to keep it.  They knew that we were only victims in the making and weren't mad at us.  We were stuck with the scammers though and couldn't get away from them.  The Mexican man was the 'devil'.  He took over the role of my father.  I wanted my own father back, but I was the only one who had any recollection of my father.  The devil had wiped my mother's memory and she saw him as her husband.  There were no records or pictures of my father, and I would have to comply with the devil's wishes in order to get my father back.
