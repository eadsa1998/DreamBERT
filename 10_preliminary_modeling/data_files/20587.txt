I was climbing a structure that resembled the Eiffel Tower. I was a little afraid of losing my hold. I was about three stories above the ground. Someone was down there looking on (my sister, I think). Later people were moving from apartments. A car and trailer stood in an open area, and a mattress fell from the sky. I wondered where the mattress had come from, since there were no buildings nearby.
