At university library to get information on the exam schedule. Shown a catalog with pictured cover. Hunt for ethics test as I am to take that exam. Talking to a 10 or 12 year old child. "You don't remember me." "Oh Yes I do, you caught that burglar in Maui." I can't remember such an incident. Find book and want to take it but I have left my card. Sat to new librarian, "You don't know me but I am Madorah Smith." Look around for someone of the bystanders to identify me. (After I had gotten up at 6:30 to put out butter, etc., I fell back asleep and dreamt again.)
