Roxanne comes over and scrubs floors: Father Andrew calls. He is conducting some sort of poll. I sit downstairs on porch. I apologize then I sit down and don't fuss. (Although I joke about 'fussing'). Then Father Andrew asks questions: I ask him whether to accept position as nursery school director. I tell him of my work with Ted Filandrinos (youth director with whom I worked in fall) and also of desire to keep library open. He gives me a key ring with two keys: one small one on a string and a large metal key. I look at them carefully and am very pleased.
