I am at Ellie's counselor. He wants to get information from me to help Ellie. We have to make another appointment because something isn't working out for this time. I feel frustrated. I think about going across the street to do some shopping, but decide not to. Now, I am driving. I decide after I start driving that I want to go to Payless and buy some things. I discover that I have gotten on the exit of the freeway and I'm going the wrong way. I stop, turn around, and try to find the way to cross the freeway and get back to the Payless store. It seems impossible. I get on the freeway going toward home, finally going the right direction, but now I'm a passenger, with Doug driving and Lydia in the middle. I see an exit and say, "Let's go here, maybe it will take us back to Payless." We turn. I deliberately give Doug the silent treatment as he is being obnoxious as usual. I really don't like him a lot. As we drive back on a highway, we are right on the edge of the ocean. Doug says, "Look how beautiful, the sun, anyway, the light." I can't help but agree. It is a wide, blue expanse of water and it's beautiful. I see a huge sign that says "Payless" off in the distance and we round a corner to discover the tiny road we are on stops abruptly at an embankment and doesn't connect with the curved road that does go to Payless. Now we are out of the car and I think about walking there, but it's a long way on arthritic feet. Doug has a tiny "6 shooter," which is even less dangerous than a 22, a pistol. A part falls out of it on the road. It's lightweight and cheap. I think he was threatening me with it. I see Uncle Dale and Aunt Bridget jogging down the road. We chat. I get angry at Doug and stand up to his silly gun threat of shooting me. I decide to leave them and the car and walk back to Payless.
