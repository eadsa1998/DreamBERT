I was testing for my science project, and my friend Helen was helping me. I asked a couple people to come up one at a time to test milk. It had 1% nonfat, 2%, 3% (whole). I asked Paul to come up and test it. Setting: In the science room. Characters: Me, Helen - my friend, and Paul - a stupid boy in school. Feelings and Thoughts: Pushed. I don't really remember the rest to the dream if there was (more). But at night I said "I will remember my dream." Yesterday I also thought a lot about my science project.
