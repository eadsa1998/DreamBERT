I was in a house and I was busy doing things, busy with my life.  And then I came into the kitchen / utility room area, and Risk came into the room, it seems like from the utility room or the back door.  And she looked at me, with a look that said:  You've been so sure that I would die that you took it for granted.  You're all positive that I'm gonna die, but I'm still here.  In your minds I'm already dead, but I'm still here.  I need some attention.  And I knelt down with her, she had that pony smile.  And I knelt down in front of her, and she sat down by me, and she put her head near mine, and she started snuggling up with me.  And then I sat down on the floor, and she laid down in my lap, like kind of heavy.  Almost fell in my lap, across my leg, my bent leg.  I had both arms around her, one, my right arm, down her back, and my left arm around her neck and her shoulders.  And I started scratching her tail bone like she likes.  And her tail wagged a little bit.  So I said, "You want me to do that some more?"
