 I ask my roommate Norman Noman if we can eat his chicken that is in the freezer for our barbeque. He says yes, and I take it out of the freezer to thaw. In the freezer there is a pork chop in a glad lock bag with a green dot on the bag. I take the bag out to get rid of the pork chop because it has been there a long time. I'm told it is Lemont's pork chop. I ask who Lemont is, and am told that it is Arnold, a guy who used to live in our house last year. I don't care whom the pork chop belongs to: I'm getting rid of it.
