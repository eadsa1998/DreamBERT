I am a depressed woman and I decide to call Ginny up and go visit her so I can be alone and depressed in a safe place. I go there and decide to go outside and sit in the parking lot. As I'm there, now I'm pregnant. A large man comes by and threatens to rape me. I stand up, reaching for something to hit him with. He sees I'm prepared to fight and he ponders the odds of a 200 + lb. woman and a 300 + lb. man. He backs off. I go in, feeling scared, angry and frozen feelings. I tell someone about it. Then a teenager asks me if it's ok to teach my 3-year-old girl about sex and actually to make love to her. I feel uneasy, even though the person's logic makes sense. It supposedly would help the girl learn about sex. But finally I say, "I'm sorry, I just can't let you do it. She's too young. It could scare her or hurt her."
