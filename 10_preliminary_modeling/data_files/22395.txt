I was riding on a bicycle along some avenue and I saw a car going the wrong way, and I told this to the police. The driver realized it and chased me in his car. I was going towards a steep curve on the edge of a cliff. When I turned, I fell into the void. I saw myself lying at the bottom, and next to me a person who had fallen with me. I felt dead and wanted to say goodbye to a very dear girlfriend, but when I didn't get an answer from her, I thought that (I deduced) if this was so, I hadn't died, because if I had died, there is a belief that dead people say goodbye to their most loved ones.
