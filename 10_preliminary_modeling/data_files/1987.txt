I am packing. I have to leave at 3:30 to get on the bus by 4:00. One of my students declares his love for me. His name is Harry Palmer and he has a crazy mother. He's a little plump and flabby, but a nice guy. I feel warmth for him, but tell him no. I appreciate his feelings but I don't return the feelings. He is pathetically sad. I am telling my students, two males and one young woman, about my travels. The other man is seated on the floor very close to the woman. She whines that it's her space. I agree with her and ask the guy to move. He goes to another spot, crawling under a bookshelf. He finds a filmstrip and I hold it up to the light. I say it's very interesting. Old time pictures. He wants us to get a projector and look at them. I say, "If we have time," and then I see it is 2:45! "Oh! No time," I say and rush off to pack. I start to pull books and papers out of a drawer and say, "It's not like I'm going to France." I'm just leaving the community college for a while. I can return to get things later. I see that Harry has forgotten my toothbrush and shrug my shoulders. Oh well. I can get another.
