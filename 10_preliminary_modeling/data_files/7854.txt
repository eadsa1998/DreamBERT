Matthew and I were living with Mother and Daddy. Belle had puppies. We gave one puppy to Uncle J and Aunt A. We gave tow of them to someone else but I don't remember now who. We still had four of the puppies. I was playing with a caramel-colored puppy and realized it had been a long time since they had a bath. I decided to get Sir Gallahad's brush and brush them. I thought that brush would work fine since they were just puppies and very small. Their hair was matted, kind of like an old stuffed animal. After I brushed them, their hair was silky, soft, just like Belle's. Someone said all the puppies hadn't had their shots so we couldn't give them away yet. That was when I realized that I had already given three away. I realized we could get the two back to get them their shots but we couldn't get the other one back from Kidwell's.
