I dreamed that I lived in Manhattan. So one night I was showering and had to go get something. When I was going back to finish my shower, a man jumped out and tried to rape me. I freaked out and tried to scream, but I couldn't make any sound. It was awful. I tried to tell My mother what happened, but I had lost my voice. Thank god I woke up!
