All I recall of the dream was that I was meeting somebody's relatives. There was an emotional air that seemed to be reasonably joyous. I appeared to be meeting her indoors. Inside as opposed to outside. I guess it was a house. It wasn't an auditorium or anything. I seem to be talking in the dream. I can remember that I was the principal speaker. I guess it was conversation because I was meeting new people. Apparently I was telling a story of some kind because I was talking for a long time. What other people do, or were asking questions, and I was relating an anecdote or something.
