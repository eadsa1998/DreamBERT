I was sitting in the kitchen just doing nothing. The time of day wasn't too clear, although I believe it was early morning. Our family owned two cats; a little black kitten and the huge white mother cat. As I was sitting in the kitchen I could hear the mother cat coming out from the basement. To my surprise, a lion appeared instead of the mother cat.
