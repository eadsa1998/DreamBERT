I was in the pool with a snorkel mask, I think I took my pants off.  My friend Deanna was there.  I went inside the restaurant with someone and picked up two bottles of Jones soda.  I saw my best friend Emma on the way out.  I went to move the car and had some difficulty with control.  When we got back, I was hot and sweaty so I jumped in the pool again.  A cute boy approached me and we swam together for a little bit.  I had a sweater on for some reason.  We got pretty close in the water, though I don't think we ever kissed.  I don't know if someone then said something, but I realized it wasn't just a cute boy, it was my good online friend Del, and I felt sort of embarrassed.
