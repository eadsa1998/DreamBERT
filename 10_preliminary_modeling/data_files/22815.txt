I'm sitting in some auditorium - at school, I think - maybe the talent show.  Pat Byers is there, on one side, and Sharon is on my left.  Sharon had gone somewhere a few minutes before, and the event is almost over, and we are starting to get ready to leave when Pat suddenly throws her arm around my neck and kisses me.  It feels good, but out of the corner of my eye I see Sharon, who has just come back, and I weakly push Pat away and start sweating for something to tell Sharon.
