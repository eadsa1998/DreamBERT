I was near the University. I was outside three shops: paperback bookstore, music hall, and a German restaurant. The students were grouped on the sidewalk: German-speakers in one group. French in one, and Italians in another. Near the French was a girl without legs that was being ignored. I hardly saw her, only 3-4 feet above the cement. I kneeled down and talked to her, suggesting we go to a bench and sit down. She seemed to be on small rollers although I wasn't sure. She propelled herself with her hands or fists. When we got to the bench, I sat, and she lifted herself smoothly up to be beside me. She was wearing a see-thru blouse and no bra; her breasts were small and neat, with nipples nudging the white lace-like cloth. She had her hair in a tight swirl about her head and her skin was fair and freckled. I started the conversation by saying that "Your arms can do everything better than mine." I placed my bare arm beside hers and hers was the same size as mine but harder. She said something about being lonely and I said, "There is no reason for any woman being lonely as long as all her moving parts worked; and I'll bet yours do." She had a faint smile.
