The upside down Christmas tree. Went to see a man that I had met once before professionally but I'm not sure why [unknown in waking life]. It was a very short visit. As I got ready to leave he offered to make me some coffee. Even though I said no, he insisted. Then he had me put the first two fingers of my right hand in a box of powered chocolate. When I took them out he told me to put them in my mouth and lick them off. Obviously, this felt very provocative to me and it appeared to me that he had a romantic interest in me, or something other than professional. We played around, though I don't know how to explain it. It was nothing sexual at all. I had something of his and he was chasing me around the house trying to get it back and we were laughing. He caught me in a room with a bed, knocking me down on the bed. We kissed but we were interrupted by another man that he knew so we got up and went back out into the other room. Eventually he asked me on a date. I was hesitant but decided that with him it would be okay. I could let go of some of my fears and inhibitions about dating with him.
