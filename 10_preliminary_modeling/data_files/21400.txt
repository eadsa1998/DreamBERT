I saw #72 and #12. A fellow came over from the gas station and wanted change for 85 cents in change that he had. I gave it to him in smaller change. I was by Andy's house. There was a water line running thru it. He had about a 2 _ inch line running to the house. Then this was connected to a _" line, then this was connected to a 30" line, which was in square pipes about 3 ft. long and some of the pipes were different sizes down the line, which was still uncovered, but they were square. I was shooting at birds with Bob's pellet gun. I could see the pellets go and how close they would come to the birds. I was shooting at a crow at a good distance and I hit him. He flew and his feathers flew out of him as he did.
