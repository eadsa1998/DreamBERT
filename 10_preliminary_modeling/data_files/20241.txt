I saw some animals. I left them and went up a street. Long cables were strung across the street. Buildings about 20 stories were on either side. But they all seemed to be slanting forward at the top. It looked as though there had been an earthquake, except that it looked unreal because all the buildings slanted the same way as though they had been built that way, and everything on the street below looked normal. There was no damage anywhere. Later I was told that the buildings were going to be razed. A man told me not to pick up some nearby stones, because they were copper. A woman came and told me the man had said she as 15/10 (sic) which he said is a good height.
