I was watching Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. There was this boring part where this girl scratched her face on top of this guy with a bandaged chest. I was in a pool with Ezra and I was chasing him. I caught him eventually, but when I did a plastic thing went over my face and I couldn't breathe. Then I woke up and in real life I had trouble breathing.
