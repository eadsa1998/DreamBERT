I was with a girl from choir.  She initiated things sexually, and I manually stimulated her genitals her until she had an orgasm, although she didn't reciprocate.  Then I went to bed with a man- I'm not sure if it was my boyfriend Jeremy or not.  I started giving him oral sex, but my housemate Andre came in to use the computer.  I went and sat at the table with two men; one was interviewing the other as a new housemate.  I don't remember the details but he seemed like a troublemaker.  I went to curl up on the couch, which was like my parents'.  I was going to sleep on the back of it, but decided it was more trouble than it was worth and curled up on the seats.  I was depressed that I couldn't get sexual satisfaction.
