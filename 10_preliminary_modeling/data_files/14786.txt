I went to near Dad's new place. There was a toilet and it was like a seat on a bus and I decided not to go. There was a huge lump of pipes. I started to climb down and I realized I needed to be up (it was on the edge of a platform and went a few meters down). It was pushing me down though. My hands got sore. Some guy who had been in it had blisters. Some guys helped me out. I wanted to contact Mom but nothing was in my pockets. Later, she had a laptop with a webcam. The cops were watching her for illegal downloading. Sometimes it was a show and it was about a lady and her son, who was Shia LaBeouf. There was a game that Dmitri played and he made his name "LaurenIsAHag" as a joke and I hit him. Ezra laughed. There was a second movie and they had changed stuff and threatened to close the game and he changed it something else.
