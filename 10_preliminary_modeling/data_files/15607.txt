There was a weird zombie-like disease happening to animals that would make them attack you. I was in a room with some of them and I ran out. I tried to hold the door closed. Outside people were getting infected animals to attack us, so we ran. I got chased into a building by a fat lesbian/bisexual. She asked us questions about sex in slang. One was about blowjobs and I was like 'ew no'. I climbed up a ladder where I found this little helicopter thing which I'd dreamt about previously and I got on that and flew away.
