Some people were after me and this guy. We ran into a shop. I had recently lost my shoes and I grabbed some more but I grabbed two left ones. I kept trying to look but the people kept turning up. We ran to the back of the store and into the toilet and locked the door. I sat at the door to hold it closed. They got in anyway. We attacked and got out. We found a fancy hotel place. There was a room with a spa bath etc. My friend died. I took his shoes which were big, but they fit. When I locked the door, I hit a button which sounded the alarm. They came and I left. Later, I came back. There was a pet shop and I got a uniform. They had a Chow Chow creature and the people were after that.
