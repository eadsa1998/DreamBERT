I was staying over at a female friend of mine's house. I was dreaming that I was dreaming. I was in the same room that I was actually in. My friend was perpendicular to me in her bed. I saw this demon-like creatures with wings flying around me. There were 2 or 3, they were very scary looking, green and brown in color. They bagan pulling me by my ankles and my wrists., they were trying to pick me up off the bad. I struggled and screamed for my friend. I supposedly woke up. I couldn't see anyone around. My friend even answered to my call. But I could still feel the pull on my ankles. My friend said she couldn't see anybody, when I said I could feel something or someone pulling on me. I then woke up.
