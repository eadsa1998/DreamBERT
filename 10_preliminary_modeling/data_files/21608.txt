As I about fell asleep, I thought of the daily double and it was 4-1-4. It seemed to have a halo around it. Ann's father had a gun pointing at me. He thought I was a stranger and was protecting himself. He was concealing some secret ailment from me and then I saw the cloth taken away from his body and his penis was gone. Cancer had eaten it away. I was flying in White's. Three men came up to rob us. One was a big man. They pulled out guns and I got out of the way of them. They had water pistols. I got one away from one of them and squirted water into the side. It burned his eyes because he couldn't see. Then I picked one up and threw him on his head, then the other one, and they were beginning to see I was strong and started to move away from me. I made magic. I commanded the towel to come into my hands from the clothesline and it did. Then I threw a towel on the floor and made it come to me when I commanded it. Then one towel started to spin and disintegrate by my feet. I made a sign of the cross and commanded it to go away and it stopped. My brother Steve went down a basement that seemed like a dungeon, a place of dead corpses. He seemed to be a strange being. He ate human flesh.
