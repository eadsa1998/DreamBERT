I was sitting at a computer working and Matthew was sitting next to me. But he was only 5-6 years old. He was sitting there talking about helping me. He said, I know how I can help you. I can help you enter things. He was referring to entering references into my Endnotes software. I said, do you really think you can help me with that? You're kind of little to do that aren't you? He said something to the effect that he can help. I turned and looked at him and said, well, here's what I think. I think I'm dreaming right now. And, in waking life you're alot older and I asked you to help me with this and you started and you did a good job. But, now, I don't know. You're kind of little. He said, Whooaaa!
