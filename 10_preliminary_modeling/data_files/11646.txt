I was trying to get an injured dog to the hospital. To do this I had to carry him through a swamp. When I was going through the swamp there was a pack of wolves attacking me. As I remember it they were very small wolves, about the size of a small dog. These animals weren't ferocious, but only chewed at the boots that I had on.
