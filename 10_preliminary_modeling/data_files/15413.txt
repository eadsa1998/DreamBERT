I was at university doing the first lesson in a new course. We had to pair up and I ended up with this girl with curly blonde hair and a weird mousy face. It was boring and had nothing to do with the topic so I was playing on my phone. A guy complained about it. Then it was school. The desks were really close to each other and some faced the wall. I moved my desk back a bit. Dad was in the class too. Ms Eckert was the teacher. There was some activity where we had to take letters out of our name and that would be your name in some weird place. Mine was Lamp and Eugene's was something like 'eathinin'. They were on a sheet in a 'museum'. Then I was in a house. Jensen Ackles, Alexander Skarsgard, another guy and some others were at a table. Someone was making me write up a list of 'love' for them (ones that I had dated?). I had those three left, but Jensen was next and went to do something quickly.
