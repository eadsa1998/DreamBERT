I looked at the results and saw Uptrend 2nd 27.00. Ann and I were on a vacation for 2 weeks. We had another week to go. We were going to go to Niagara Falls for a week, but she wanted to come home first. I said, "We will not go home, just to Niagara Falls from here." Barbara was home taking care of our home. I was walking thru mud with Grandpa. He was sort of apologizing for what he did to me in a round about way. I was sleeping in my top shirt only, so in my dream I was walking in Rivertown in my shirt only. I was ashamed, but didn't meet no one. I got into the house and my sister Ann was in the kitchen. I had a hard-on, so I asked if she would lay for me, and she said, "I am afraid to get knocked up." I said, "You don't have to worry about that." So she lay on her back. I was just ready to get on her and my mother came downstairs, so I didn't do it. I was watching some fellows that work with me. They were digging graves. I put my arms around a pillar and held myself because I was up high on a building.
