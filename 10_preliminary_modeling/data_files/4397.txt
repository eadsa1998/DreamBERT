["Dreams conference at the Caribbean islands."] Ginny and I are going to a dreams conference on an Caribbean island. She is pushing me in a manual wheelchair. There are lots of workshops and I am going to them to enjoy the information. On our way back into the hotel, we stop at a shower room to take a shower. I walk up five steps and enter. The room is huge. There are maybe 2 or 3 shower heads in a large circle. I sit on a chair waiting for my turn. Another woman finishes her shower and I see Ginny has gone in search of towels. I then see a set of small brown towels on a rack near the shower head. I take the shower. It is warm and peasant. Ginny returns. We are going to the next event. Maybe dinner.
