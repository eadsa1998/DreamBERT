The dream began when I was standing in front of a large building at an intersection on S-- C-- A--. The next thing I knew, I was inside the building standing in front of the elevators and pushing the buttons which signaled for the elevators. However, in my dream these buttons now acted as a doorbell to my dentist's office on a floor above. Since there was no answer to the button which I rang, I assumed my dentist was out, and I left. I felt rather relieved that I didn't have to see him. I walked out of the building and this time, next to the building entrance, I noticed a movie theater. I stopped to look at the pictures posted on the billboard. I noticed that the people who were starred in this picture looked familiar. Then I realized that the stars of this movie were my mother and father-in-law. I looked at each picture carefully now. I noticed that in each picture, the expressions on the faces of my parents-in-law were different. In one picture they looked surprised, in another happy and in several they appeared to be scowling at each other and fighting with one another. My mother-in-law did not look like she does at the present time. In the dream she appeared as she did when she was much younger. I then remembered that my brother and his family lived in an apartment in this buildlng, and I decided to visit them. For some reason--what I don't remember--I could not visit them. Here the dream ended.
