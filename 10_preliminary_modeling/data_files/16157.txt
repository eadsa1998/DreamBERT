I was at this farm like type thing, and what in the world is going on with this tape? And I had this dream that there were these horses and [laugh] this guy stepped away and I had to hold them like dogs on a leash and keep them from running away. And they were starting to like wrestle me down and stuff, and finally the guy came back. They were starting to eat the clothes off my body, and the guy came back and got them under control. And we were taking them down to the water for some reason, and then all of a sudden, when I reached the second floor, I realized that we were at our house. And somehow I had the notion that Dad was going to bring the PU (?) around front in the truck, and [laugh] I was going to have to climb out the window and cross this little bridge-like type thing going out in the back of the truck and ride along in the back. And then I woke up.
