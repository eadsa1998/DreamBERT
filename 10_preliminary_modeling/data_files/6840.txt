Hunting for my blue nylon dress in closet. Find a black and white print and put it on instead and go riding and walking with H. After walk H. calls my attention to fact that my dress is too long. I go to her room and remove it and hunt again for nylon dress. Take down a blue jersey and lay it aside. Notice black and white print isn't mine and it is soled at the bottom. Ask H. if she has had other guests who might have left it. Look in closet in next room but Ad. Is coming there and I haven't dressed.
