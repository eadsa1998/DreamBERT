I was at work cashiering. It was a very slow night. I saw this girl walk into the store with some guy. I thought the girl was my girlfriend with some other guy. I watched them from my register into the aisle. When she turned around and came walking to the front of the store where the registers are, I noticed it wasn't she, and I was very relieved.
