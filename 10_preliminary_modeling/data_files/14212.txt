I was with hobbits (all from The Lord of the Rings movie) and we were trying to get away from wraiths. I was with Pippin, Frodo and presumably Sam although I don't know if he was with us. Merry had left earlier. Pippin had psychic abilities and could hear how far away the wraiths were. We got home and were hiding at the window in the dining room, they were too close so we didn't have time to go anywhere else. The table wasn't there. They came in and found us straight away. I asked the leader if I could get a water bottle. He said no and I said that I was going to get thirsty. We had been in the desert at some point. He gave us names and mine was "Honesty". I was then doing a quest on Runescape which was supposed to be the longest quest. I was with a girl and a guy. I was in a red place that looked like the city of TzHaar and had lava streams around. I couldn't pause the quest until I found a job (it was like a social simulation game now). I was immune to poison and couldn't lose any health, because you had to stand on lava for some of it. I had to assign a job to Ezra first and I gave him the best paying one and it gave all positive attributes and one skill a day (though, not a Runescape skill). I had to get a lower paying job somewhere else, the options included at a hairdressers and a cinema. I don't know what I picked.
