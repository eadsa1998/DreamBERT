I was in some kind of an upstairs room with a couch or bed at one end.  I was with some acquaintances, but I don't remember who.  On the couch two people were making love.  There were several sex magazines lying around, and I picked up a couple and looked at them, but was embarrassed for the others to know I was interested in them.  When the couple on the couch was through making love, the girl looked up very sweetly and innocently as if to say "Next."  I really wanted to get on her, but I wasn't perfectly sure I had interpreted her correctly, so I hesitated-and then she disappeared.  I began looking for her in the house, and it was a kitten I was looking for.  A very unusual kitten-pale blue with a pink head, or vice versa.  There were several other kittens around, and every once in a while I spotted the one I was looking for, but don't remember what came of it.
