Matthew and I were driving back to the city where I live from St. Joe. As we neared I-465, nearer to the city, you could see the skyline. In the skyline there were two very distinct buildings. One was directly in front of us. The other was off a little bit to the left. They both had very large words on top of the buildings. I could read them from there. We were talking about the buildings, what they were, which one was tallest building in the city. I decided that the one to the left was in my way, was blocking my vision while driving so I reached up and bent it over, almost a U shape, to the ground. That didn't break anything. Now Matthew is a very young child and it's the fourth of July. We're on our way to see the fireworks. My intention was to find someplace close to home, on the way home, to just stop and watch the fireworks and then go the rest of the way home. Matthew was pouting because he wanted to go over to the west side of town, to some place where I knew it would be packed with people to watch fireworks. I had to call Darren for some reason. I was trying to be very nice. I wasn't sure how he was going to be with me on the phone after my latest emails when he got kind of miffed at me. I was still being very nice. He asked me how I was and I said fine. I told him Matthew was pouting. Darren said something. I guess I didn't realize that he wanted to talk to Matthew. Then he said, No. I'm not kidding. Put him on the phone. I gave Matthew the phone. Apparently Darren said something to him about pouting. At this point we were laughing. We weren't in the car anymore and there were a lot of people around. I was trying to explain to Matthew that it was going to be so crowded and uncomfortable and it would take us so long to get out of there after the fireworks. I let Matthew talk to Darren. Darren seemed to make it a little better but not much.
