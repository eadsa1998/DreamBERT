Marissa Camden and I get dressed up and go out together. We come to a place where an artist makes a painting of us. I see how carefully he makes the brush strokes, reminds me of Van Gough. Then I see how he makes her face out of a whole picture, then he turns it around; but Marissa is offended. She rushes through the city and I run after her, but she dives into a river and swims at a very fast clip to the other shore. I am astounded. I cannot follow, as I carry the painting and don't want to get wet.
