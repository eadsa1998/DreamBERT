I was in the country with my shotgun. I saw an animal run. I could have a shot it, but I didn't want to shoot it because the shot would fly over some of my friends' heads over the field. Time Honored came to me in my sleep. In my dream I said it came to me and we talked about someone's birthday it falling on. I took a ride in a young fellow's car. I climbed into the back seat and he didn't know till he stopped that I was with him. His car was long. It was bout 35 ft. long. I was flying. I flew above the trees, then came down lower. A couple old men were on the street and they thought I was some kind of bird or demon. One fellow tried to hit me with a stick. Then I was on top of a building and I jumped off and flew swiftly away. I was in a bus and there sat a small boy. He had a mustache. I asked him how old he was and he said 9. I was dancing with May Snider. I was holding Judy and another child. I was hugging and loving them up. I am not sure, but it seems I heard Jody.
