I dreamt of two friends who often come to visit us: Richard and Mike. In the dream I was in the living room and suddenly Mike arrived. I think he came from the patio and I don't remember well what I told him, but he got defensive. Later, Richard appeared, but he was representing a person other than himself. They were questioning me indirectly about my boyfriend Danny (who was not present there), but I got upset at Richard's attitude because he was smiling ironically.
