I am looking at this "Gorgeous Guys" book and it lists all the guys' addresses, so I went to visit the small kid from the show "Alf." Jon Bon Jovi and his wife lived next door, but I wasn't sure if he was home. Then I saw him  and his wife outside. I ran to him screaming. Then we went cruising and I went to go get my camera. When we were at my house, he started kissing me and rubbing my back. I was in heaven. We went to take his picture, but I lost him. I had a backstage pass and front row seats. He got a divorce and was going steady with me.
