There was a new episode of Supernatural out. It started weird. It started off with Sam and Dean but they were with a girl, who was Rachel McAdams, and were following her. It was funny. She was in a skimpy Santa outfit. These guys had made a resort full of prostitutes. She was talking and saying that she fully supported it. Then when she was out of sight of them (the guys who had made the resort) she told a heap of the girls to run. Some got caught. Then it kept reversing and kept happening over and over. The son of the leader guy liked her but he was evil too. The subtitles on the screen were funny and one was about tacos. Some nerdy girl was going to something that some guy called Terence D'Arby was doing and she was excited about it. At the end of the episode it showed a newspaper with Sam and Dean's faces in a crowd and they were on a list of names. I was like 'that's kinda gay". There were some people with a Labrador puppy and it was acting weird. I realized that it was Sylar (Heroes). This girl in the family realized and he showed himself to her. He mentioned some cat was missing. The girl was now me. I said "you killed my cat?!" and he said "I didn't say anything about killing". There was a movie with Robert Downey Jr. and he had a weird ring on his right little finger.
