["Ignoring the dead woman who isn't dead"]  I am at an open area like a wide sidewalk with shops lining it. I walk toward a shop and see a woman lying on the parking area right next to the sidewalk. She looks dead. I am a bit concerned but I don't do anything. I decide to leave and start to walk to my car. A man comes by the woman's body and I stop and watch as he sees her and is very upset. He paces and thinks what to do. I wonder if he will leave her there. He thinks about leaving her but decides he must call the authorities. I am beginning to realize that I should have done that. I feel a bit guilty. I walk back towards the scene. As I start to pass the body, she gets up suddenly. She had been in some kind of trance or unconscious  and suddenly awoke. She is a bit disoriented and groggy but all right. I am amazed and really feel bad now about not being helpful. She was still alive.
