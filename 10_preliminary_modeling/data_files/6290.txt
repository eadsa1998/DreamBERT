[The dream happened after or before the ATM dream.] In this dream, I dreamt I had my "Horizon Reader" book in my bag. I believe the reason why I dreamt about the book was probably due to my eagerness in having it. I left my book in my locker, because my bag was heavy enough. I didn't need to increase the load. So I left it in my locker. But now I regret having done that because I have a reading assignment due next week. I was elated to find in my dream that my English "Horizon Reader" was in my bag. Of course this was just a dream. My book is actually in my locker. Strange, isn't it?
