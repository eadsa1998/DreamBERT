[Before I went to bed, the neighbors' security/motion-activated lights kept going on and off, on both sides of our house.  I heard sounds outside too, leaves rustling, while on the porch and also later in bed, and the Burbeys' dog barked at 6 a.m.  Right afterward, I heard a police siren come near our street.  I had this feeling Lynn had come to Texas, had found me.  I knew even in the dark I would know his walk, his body, and know it was him.]  I dreamed Lynn did come to the neighborhood.  He drove a new white Jeep CJ-7 with no top.  [In previous dream of 9/15/96, Lynn's vehicles were all white 4WD's.]  I was glad he was here.  I had been almost watching for him it seemed, or glimpsing him pass back and forth on the streets, and we both knew we were watching for a time when I could go out to the street unnoticed.  It was night.  He was driving fast and recklessly.  I saw my chance when both Mom and Dad were gone.  I ran out in front of Gretchen's house (my best friend in childhood) as he drove that way and waved him down.  He got out of the jeep and we talked but we knew we didn't have much time and we were rushed and didn't get to say the things we wanted.  Then I saw Mom and Dad return to the house, in the spaces between the houses.  I said I have to get back now, before they know.  We went between the Davitt's house and the McGowan's.  There was a black iron gate there. Lynn opened it for me or helped me open it.  I was touched somehow by his helping me with this.  I ran between the houses.
