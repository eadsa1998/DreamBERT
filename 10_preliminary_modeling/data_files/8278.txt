I was in a house with a bunch of children from the TV show Seventh Heaven. They had a friend visiting that was putting a drug or something in their drinks. None of them thought that it was harmful. They didn't realize what it was. I was pleading with them not to drink it - not to mess with that stuff. I was very upset and worried about them.
