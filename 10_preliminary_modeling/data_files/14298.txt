Mom mentioned having been at our school and talking to Alyssa recently. I said that Alyssa was a Year 12 and wouldn't have been there. Then Ezra and I were at school and it was different. We were going to leave and there were slugs with legs, which we walked around. Then there was a fairly big purple lizard in our path. We walked around that and then there were huge octopus like legs everywhere (like a meter or bigger thick and very long). We ran and I made sure to run undercover and it was taking people. I got to the end of the undercover parts and was at the oval. Lots of other people were at the start of it too. We all ran at the same time and people were getting picked off as we ran.
