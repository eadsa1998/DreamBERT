I am Whoopi Goldberg and I'm in a house. I go outside and see a Chinese young woman trying to drown herself. Her mother is distraght. The young woman was about to be married to a nice man. Then I see the giant coming. I run into the house. The giant eats people. The giant wears a hat. He  looks into the house through the window. He is so big that his eye is as big as the window. I hide, but he sees me. I grab a stick and poke him in the eye. He is in pain and cries out. I run out the house, looking back to see if he's chasing me. I see a huge shadow of him in his hat coming after me. Then I see a whole crowd of them all in hats coming after me. I run toward the carnival the young man owns.
