["Out of control in the snow."] Ellie is driving the car. I am in the passenger seat. Snow is on the ground. She drives to the back of the house and says look at that hill. I look. It is a very steep driveway going down. I say be careful, back up so we don't go other the edge. I am referring to the cliff in front of us. She tries to back up but we start rolling forward and we are now headed down the steep driveway, sliding and out of control. I am tense but somehow, Ellie manages to keep control enough so that as we are racing 100 miles per hour over the landscape. It is a wild ride but somehow I know we are going to be all right. We finally come to a stop near a restaurant and we go in to have a cup of coffee or something to soothe our nerves. Paulina is with us. She was in the back seat of the car during the ride. We go in and in order to get up to the level where a table is, we have to climb up on a white toilet seat as our first step up. The water is overflowing and I gingerly try to place my foot so it doesn't get wet. Then I have a very high step to make up a sort of water slide thing.
