We were at this motel. I had a nice room. The curtains were opened a little. Two guys and a girl walked past and then came back and were watching me. Then they came in. One guy came over to my bed. The other two started making out. They were trying to get me to do drugs and drive. One guy poured drugs on me. One of the guys asked me for HIV, which was a contraceptive. I started yelling at them that I was only 14. They left. Dad got up and I told him what happened.
