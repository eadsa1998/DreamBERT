       I help a young woman with reddish hair to move into her apartment; somehow she lives next to where Pedro lives. I talk with her about her problems and she leaves. I see Pedro and we talk and are close. Just then that girl comes into the apartment and I introduce her. "What a coincidence." Pedro leaves and I stay to talk to her and leave later.
