[1997-06-09] The family that lived next door had moved away in July, out of state, and I dreamt that they were visiting here. They have a 12 year old son and he was visiting for some reason and for some reason I was picking up pieces of folded paper and paper money. I don't know where I was picking it up from, the floor or the breakfast bar, I don't know. I wasn't doing anything with it like giving it to him. I was glad that they were back for a visit.
