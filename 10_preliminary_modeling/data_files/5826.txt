[c. 1989] Plane crash. I remember being inside this plane and the feeling of acceleration and the feeling of everything associated with the way planes fly...My total fear came later when I was with these strange people. It seemed as if I was the only one among these strangers. Mary wasn't here and it seems no matter how hard I try I couldn't find any familiar people on the plane. There we were flying along, way up there at 30 or 40,000 feet wherever they fly and I knew that plane was going down. I felt the plane lurch and there were strange noises and the plane tipped at about a 60 degree angle down into the earth, I could feel the pressure on my head and neck and the pressure of my head just being pushed into my body, and my body being pressed forward against the seat belt. And I could remember saying "I guess we'll see you later! See you in the next world!" and that was the end of it. The reality of that dream lives with me today and I get little shivers when I think about that dream I could hear the people's voices and screams when the plane tipped up that way.
