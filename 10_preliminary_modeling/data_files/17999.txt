My old friend Candy and her mother Dena were in a car and I was talking to them.  They told me how every morning Candy milks one of her friends because somehow it helps her breast cancer.  I had trouble understanding how it helped and whether it meant her friend was a mother even though she was a teenager.  I saw something that had numbers on it that I interpreted to be the girl's weight; I asked if her being almost 200 pounds had something to do with it, admitting that I really didn't understand- much of anything.  So Candy sort of demonstrated what she does on some paper funnels, as if that would help- though it was the why it helps I was curious about, not the how.  A thought crossed my mind that it was interesting Candy did this, thinking the girl could get along just as well with a breast pump, and I wondered if Candy was bisexual.
