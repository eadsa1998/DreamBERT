I was standing on top of a deep ravine watching the construction of a railroad bridge. The workmen were putting down the track and were using an engine and several cars to do it. The engine was pulling the cars and also the track. It was about halfway across the bridge when one of the cars caught on the end of the track and the engine pulled track and all out too far. All went plunging down to the bottom of the ravine.
