I went into work for a bit as Isaak had called me in. A guy I didn't know was working there and he couldn't remember what I did there and I left out the back and it was still light outside. My car was out the front near the road. This guy had a gun and I ignored it and got into my car. He came over and I locked my door and started the car and left. Then I was being chased by the cops and others. I drove to some hard to find building and went in looking for someone.
