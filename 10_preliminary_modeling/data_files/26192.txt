 There is a knight, like Hercules. Evil men dressed in armor on horses capture him. The group has a leader. Hercules gets off his horse and picks up a small blue metal bow with a short white arrow. He is very casual about this, and does it slowly. This seems like it is in an area very similar to the pit-room at home. The arrow for the bow has a drawstring wrapped tightly around the notched end. He draws back the arrow with everyone standing around, and fires it into the throat of one of the guards, who also has a bow. As he does this, I feel his motions, as if I am he, shooting the arrow. The arrow was drawn slowly, with all the evil men around. The men didn't do anything about it. I run out of the front door of my home. It's as if I have done the shooting and the men will be chasing me. I'm gasping for air because I have just been shot in the throat. My mom is out near the front sidewalk doing some work, like pulling weeds. I know the leader and men will follow me. I run. I think of hiding underneath the foundation of the house Mike Bautsch is putting up on the corner of Home Avenue and 2nd Street. It's dark under the house, which is lofted off the ground by huge wooden pillars. I run on. The leader of the group seemed so confident he was ignorant.
