I am crawling up, hand over hand, a long pole. It's the entrance to the penthouse. I am very afraid. Maybe my hands won't hold on and I'll fall. I'm afraid of heights. Some man is with me, right behind me. We make it up to the top. His father is there. He's rich and uncaring. Now I'm on a boat in raging waters. Other women are on the boat, including a huge, 500 pound fat woman. The water is moving so fast, it's almost solid like taffy. I stand in one of the waves and push and work it with my hands to keep from drowning. Then suddenly the water dries up and I look forward and see a dried-up small creek bed with two old crazed men sitting on the bank. I feel terror.
