I was in a car. Nana and I were in the back. Jeremiah and Eugene were in the front, with Eugene driving. Eugene was telling Jeremiah what to ask me. There were snowflake things forming on the window. Julius ran past the car and I said "I know that guy!" and Nana said that he was good-looking. There were weird clouds. There was an ice looking one that looked like a swan. I told Eugene to shut up and he said "You shut up" and I said "You shut up!" back.
