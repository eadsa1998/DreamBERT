I was at a shop with Mom. I was looking at the movies and you could tick your favourites, so I did it with a few. Benjamin turned up and said hello to Mom and me. I ignored him, not even looking at him. I remembered he had mentioned shopping here before. He said goodbye and left. Then we were at a Science Museum type of place. I was alone and went into this aquarium bit, saying to myself that it was my favourite part. There was a turtle walking on the path and I took a photo. I was taking lots of photos and was thinking to put them on the forum, until I remembered about my silent protest. I saw Benjamin there and I tried not to look. I could 'see' his thought; 'ok, just ignore me and don't talk to me'. I thought 'that's the same thing I thought when he ditched me'. I was happy that he felt ditched as well, but was still confused why he did. Then I was at a food place. He and a friend sat in front of me and I still avoided looking. An ugly girl started dancing and Benjamin was staring at her with a 'pervy smile' and I wondered why it was always the ugly ones. I hoped that he would notice me once I lost weight.
