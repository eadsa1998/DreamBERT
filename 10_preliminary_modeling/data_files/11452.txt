This dream took place in a school building. I had many problems on my mind. I was trying to decide what subjects to take in my senior year. A geography teacher became very friendly with me so I decided it would be a good idea to take geography. As I was walking through the hall I heard some people talking about a dance that was coming up. I was worried because I did not have a date. This dance was to be held on New Year's Eve. Then I decided that I might take out the geography teacher. She was a very beautiful woman and relatively young.
