I was watching The Soprano's but I only remember seeing Tony. He had something to do with us. I was trying to remember their last names to see what Italian surnames were like. I said out loud, "Carm, Dante, Adriana La Cerva". Darren had been setting up stuff at the old house to stop people coming in while it was empty. One night I checked outside from the kitchen and I saw some movement and realized there was a guy out there. I freaked out and went to get Darren.
