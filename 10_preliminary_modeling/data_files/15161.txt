There was a new season of Arrested Development, and it wasn't funny at all and was completely random. Someone complained about something. Will Arnett was apparently 21. Then I was watching a pilot of a new show. It was a bit random. There were ships with 'aliens' and they were killing fleets to get a 'set'. I went to bed and woke up some time later and it was 9.30pm, and I wondered why it was so early. Ezra had some mates over. Mom invited me to come for a drive. She was going to an insect shop. I said I'd go, but then I was in uniform at a shop. I worked at a fish and chip shop. My boss was mean and bossed us around. I text Mom to say I wasn't going to go for the drive. There was a report that we didn't compliment or smile enough. An example complaint was about Family Guy. A guy in the show said he got things confused like "when I said Whedon, I meant idiot" and then went on to talk about Joss Whedon. I had a boyfriend who was a quadriplegic. Someone had swapped stuff around on his desk to confuse him and I was annoyed because it was my desk.
