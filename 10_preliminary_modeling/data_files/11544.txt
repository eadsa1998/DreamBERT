I was swimming about in the water when I felt something pulling on my leg. As I was being pulled under I began to yell and scream. As I looked for help I could see afar off a beautiful girl jump into the water and start swimming toward me. It seemed like she would never get there because I was just about to go under. I let out one last yell and as I sank I woke up with a start.
