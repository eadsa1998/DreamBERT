I dream I'm lying in bed and I'm late for college or work. My bed suddenly turns into a bath. After a long bath I eventually dress and go. I have a pair of roller boots instead of proper shoes which are annoying. At lunch time I go to a warehouse or shop where apparently I can buy some proper shoes. There's also some gadget I have to take back - for my baby daughter to exchange it - but they don't have the product. They speak a different language so I guess I must be abroad somewhere - Spain perhaps.
