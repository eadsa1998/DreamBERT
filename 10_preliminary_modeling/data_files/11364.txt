I was in my apartment, and while I was looking out the window, I saw an old girlfriend of mine come in the front door. I waved at her to wait for me, and that I would be right down. I tried to hurry, but was conscious of the sensation that I was very late. When I got downstairs, she was eating the people she was visiting. From then on, everything I did went wrong. I wanted very much to make an excellent impression, but was simply unable to. I went to get her a glass of water, and when I opened the cabinet the door I slammed back making a loud noise. I seemed unable to control my hands or motions. When I turned on the water it came pouring out. Then I dropped the glass with a loud smash. My hands had either too much strength, or too little strength. I could sense the feeling of disgust that the people in the room must have felt toward me. I remember feeling disgusted with myself.
