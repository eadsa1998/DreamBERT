I correspond with a boy from Venezuela. I dreamt that my letters didn't reach him because the address I had was incomplete. Then suddenly he traveled from Venezuela to Lima and arrived at my house. We hugged each other and he immediately asked for my hand and asked my parents for me in marriage. Then I was coming out of a house (very similar to the house of my aunt, but the street where it was located looked more like mine) and he and I were saying goodbye to all my family and friends. But I only saw the faces of my mother and my aunt (the one with the house) and they were wishing me happiness in my marriage. I was crying with joy. We left in a red sports car, he drove.
