I dreamt that I was talking with my roommate and we were in our living room. We were just having a normal conversation about why I haven't heard from my friend from highschool and why she hadn't heard from her friend from highschool. Then she reminded me of this huge fight that occurred between all of us. I remember having these feelings of panic and terror because I could barely remember in the dream what had occurred in the fight but I was certain my friend from highschool was really mad at me. Somehow my roommate and I were able to laugh about what we had done to each other in the fight. In my dream I started to remember that my roommate and I , during this supposed fight, had thrown each other's jackets up in the trees in front what were our different houses in highschool. Only my house was the same and my roommate's house was the house my friend from highschool lived in.
