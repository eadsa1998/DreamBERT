A plane is loading its passengers. I am the last in line. I wait. The Queen from some foreign country is on board. She is dying. I am upset with her for allowing her people to be uncomfortable just for her convenience. I patiently wait and finally it is time for me to roll on board. I am taken to the very last seat. It's wheelchair accessible. Now I am called to visit the Queen. I go to the front of the plane to the private room the Queen is in. She is veiled. I say shame on you for causing harm to your people for your own selfish reasons. She wearily pulls off her veil. I see two sets of blue eyes. She asks me my name. I tell her. She asks me to print it out for her. I do. My full name. She fills out a paper and names me the new Queen when she dies. She is happy with her choice as I will take good care of her people. Then I see a small baby rolling off a shelf. She seems to be OK. The maid comes in. I had used the commode and she concentrates on cleaning the commode. The Queen chides her for paying attention to the mundane when the momentous occasion of her death and the new Queen is more important. Then the Queen does and I go out to see the Prime Minister who is ready to take over. He is shocked to discover I am officially the new Queen. The Queen and I before she died spent some time talking about the country. Is it poor? Yes. What resources are there? Rocks. Then we'll make the world love rocks. I have good plans to make life better for the people.
