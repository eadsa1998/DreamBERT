I dreamed that I was at a Boston Bruins game. I had some sort of role in the team because I remember people coming into where I was and asking me questions. I was in a room in the Garden where when I walked out the door I was looking out of one of the skyboxes and watching the game. I don't remember Harry Sinden being there but if it was real life he probably would have been. Or maybe I was he.
