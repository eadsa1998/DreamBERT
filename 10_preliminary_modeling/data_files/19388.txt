I was at home serving supper to my friend's family. I had worked a lot to make this meal and everything was perfect. It was me and my friend's family, which consisted of my friend, a 17-year-old girl, her dad, age 50, and her mom. My friend's dad asked for a can of Coke, but I only had Pepsi, so he got really mad and started yelling at me. I was scared.
