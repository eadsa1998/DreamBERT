I am trying to persuade Frank to write a BOOK entitled "Reflections." no real response, so I make some New Year's resolutions. Some mix up about driving home without eating breakfast; It is Sunday; I see some friends from the Art College who are playing cards. I feel sorry for them playing cards on Sunday morning. (Vague ending.)
