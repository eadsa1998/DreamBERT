See Eric arrive from a trip and come to our house: He walks to the door and no one notices him as he is still sleepy. He leans on the door post and kisses it a long time. Everyone laughs. Eric is embarrassed and he runs to his home--to bed. I follow him and lie next to him and comfort him. "Please forgive us; how could we do this to you?" He finally stops crying and he gets dressed to go out. I dress and go down and wait for him in the street. I see him wearing a white trench coat with a sword (like a knight). I follow him and hear him talk with Frank at a PTA meeting, with guitar playing girls I have to take over the meeting. I am invited to the Browns for dinner: good food, but much confusion. Riding a bicycle down a very steep hill, over stumps and bushes. I fall off, screaming, but not hurt.
