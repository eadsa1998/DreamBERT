I was in a store such as a Burrows store and purchased four new bright blue desk tops. They were about 18 inches wide, 30 inches long and made of a thin plywood-like material. They had a piece attached on the back with a slab in it for their attachment to a stand, something like a music stand. I took them to class and gave three of them to other pupils, keeping one for myself. the teacher was a woman, 28, and is not only one of my instructors here at Reserve, but is also the young lady I have been dating quite a bit lately and am very fond of. For some reason or other I soon painted my desk top a duller color, pinkish brown. The teacher seemed to be quite pleased with the desks and so was I. I think some of the other students might have resented it.
