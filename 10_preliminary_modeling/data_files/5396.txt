I dreamed that I was in some hospital waiting for my brother because he'd broken his arm. Then this guy (who was a lot older than I) sat down next to my father and me and began to flirt with me. My father got annoyed and told him to piss off, which he did. But then his friends came and tried to assault my mother. So I told the nurse, and she made them leave. Next, I found a scooter, and started scootering around the hospital. Then this little boy borrowed it from me and broke his leg. Later, I decided to give the scooter to him, before I realized that he was paralyzed for life. This made me cry. My next dream was that we came home from Italy and had 5000 phone messages, but they were all just recordings of Harry Potter. I tried to check my email, but my computer had broken.
