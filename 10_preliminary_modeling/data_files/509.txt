I am with a large crowd of high school kids at a party in the woods. A bad crowd comes there and the good kids hide. The bad kids find them. One of the good kids manages to get the message that they need to help some other good kids who walk by and look in through a window. A flood happens as bad things begin to happen when the bad crowd catches them. One girl's father won't save her because she isn't a virgin so it is not worth the effort. The good kids get rescued and return to school which is like a house with a big open circular staircase. I become one of the kids. I can't quite make it to the top. Then I am wrapping a package and there is not quite enough wrapping to finish. For most of the dream I am an observer - not a participant.
