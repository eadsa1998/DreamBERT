I was walking on a wide sidewalk on a strange street and as I passed by the stores at the side, I decided that I didn't like the dream and I wanted to wake up. I as wearing long, black stockings which were wrinkled and had holes at the knees. I seemed to know that if I didn't like the dream, all I had to do was jump up in the air and land on my knees on the sidewalk. I did that and it worked. I woke up.
