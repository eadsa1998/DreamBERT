I was playing ball with some other fellows when I was younger. There was this very lovely girl watching us play. I knew her and longed for her attention. I was about 12 or 14 years old and so were the other fellows and her too. The ball got away from us and she ran to get it. It went behind some bushes to a big hole. We waited for her to come back, but she didn't, so we started to run and play something else. I began to wonder what happened to her. I went to where she went to get the ball. She wasn't there. There was this big hole with a door at the end, almost like walking down to the old-time cellars. I went in and there was this old scientist grinding his knuckles into a glass dish. I forced the dish away from him and saw there tiny dots moving around. I put it under a magnifying glass and saw the girl surrounded by the horrible creatures. I started to try and kill them with my knuckles. I woke up then. [wonder, excited, afraid neither pleasant or unpleasant, familiar location, no color]
