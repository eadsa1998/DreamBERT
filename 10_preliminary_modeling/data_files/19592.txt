Muese and I were eating at the Allies Inn. Directly behind Muese was another dining table (small plain like those at Allies Inn) at which sat 3 ladies. In moving back a little, Mr. Muese's chair strikes the elbow of one of the ladies, spilling a cup of coffee on table and on her dress. Muese is apologetic, though not effusively so, and carries off the situation perfectly. He takes a card from his pocket and writes on it (presumably his name and address, and presumably to give to the lady, so that she can get in touch with him in case her dress is permanently damaged). He evidently will be willing to reimburse her, in such a case. I admire and envy the perfect ease he displays during this episode.
