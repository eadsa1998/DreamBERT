I was at school. We had an assembly in a classroom where the girl's toilets are (but they weren't there anymore). They said girls have to not pee, although some went in there earlier and peed on the seats. Jeremiah was sitting not too far away from me and Silas was talking to him about Eugene, about how he didn't like waiting more than three seconds for a response. Then Silas said "What about Beatles noob over there" and pointed to me and Jeremiah leant over and whispered to him. Jeremiah kept saying words to me, like "parallel" and I was confused and he was laughing. This girl sitting on the ground started singing a song "bleep" and Darius was laughing. They took us to where I get picked up from and we held onto this fence and this bus pulled us along. I called Mom as I didn't want to wait there for 20 minutes. It was then night and there were trees across the road. Eugene was in there but there was a weird glow coming out, which was how I knew he was in there. Then he was right near me, and our faces were close and this light was shining through the gap. Then he was playing Pokemon. His friends said they were going to watch a "27 year old movie" and Eugene said he'd rather watch a new movie and I said I'd rather the 27 year old movie and he said we should go. I hesitated and he ran after them and then I did. I saw Mom and I told her I was going with them. Eugene also played Runescape and he was level 100 summoning and some other skills were 100 too. His total level was 1511. I was trying to work out how he got to level 100, since the maximum level is 99 and he had only joined in December 2007. We ended up at this creepy cinema place. These people broke in and caught me. Eugene had hid in time, and was flashing this light for me to follow him. They made me get a glass for them and the water in one turned into blood. The guys were covered in blood and someone said they were dead.
