A man is standing and holds a baby by its hands as it is trying to stand up. I watch and the baby is a kitten and it scampers around. I want to play with it. I see it go under a chair and see that a much smaller kitten is in there. It's about the size of a mouse. I am worried that the bigger kitten will hurt it or eat it, and I crawl under to distract the bigger kitten. I play with it and rub its cute, fat little tummy. It likes that and leaves the smaller kitten alone.
