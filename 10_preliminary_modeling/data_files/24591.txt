I was at school and we were eating lunch when this nice boy brought the garbage can over to me so I could dump my orange peelings in it. Then I looked at the orange and half of it was eaten, probably by a worm or something. Setting: At school in my lunchroom. Characters: Me, a boy, a lot of people eating. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy. I know this boy likes me. He asked me to the dance.
