I am in Aunt Elaine's house but it is the house of Senora W. We are her Spanish class waiting for her to arrive. I walk into the kitchen and look around. I think, "I guess Senora W isn't married." Then I remember she is. I sit on a counter by the stove. The girls are talking. One is talking about her Mexican boyfriend. She keeps looking at me nervously. Then she says, "His name is Hector." She pauses and says, "Your Hector." I am quite surprised. I say, "Mine used to be Hector. I thought he was in Mexico. He hasn't written me. I only write to Roberto!" I say, "I'd like to see him again to say hi!" She's nervous, so I say, "We're just friends now. It's O.K." She gets her appointment book out. "No, not this weekend. Oh, it won't work next weekend," etc. I think she must be awfully insecure about their relationship. She says she guesses she doesn't want to share any of their time with anyone else. I laugh, very superior. She gives me a package of permanent curlers. I say, "What am I supposed to do with these?" She shrugs. I say, "Oh, you leave them here for the thrift shop." I put all my unorganized papers into my purse and go to the living room.
