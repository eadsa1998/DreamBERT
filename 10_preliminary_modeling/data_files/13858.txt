I was at Mom's, which was different. We had a lizard with a red thing on its head and it burnt you if you touched it. Mr Reilly had had said before that they were extinct, so we had to be careful. We got them all in a bag. Teller came over and he spoke with a British accent. Mom and Ezra were there. Teller was pretending he was going to drive into us. He was really funny. I was telling Ezra who he was.
