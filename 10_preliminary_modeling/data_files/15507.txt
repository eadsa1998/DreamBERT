Dad had auditioned for a part in a movie a while ago. I went along with him to another one which was outside. ELO walked past and I went to Facebook it and saw Robert de Niro and Al Pacino and other famous people. I went inside and went to this room and started chatting with this other lady. She asked me what my favourite genre was and I said 'science fiction and horror... that's it'. Then I was at home in bed and I woke up and Anastasia was in my room and I said "why are you in my room" and she said sometimes she needs to apply her heat transfusion bag -- which was a chest thing. I opened something on a rack and the mirror fell off. It reflected another half without me in it. My phone vibrated and I had Facebook notifications from Benjamin and Samantha making a joke about the transfusion bag.
