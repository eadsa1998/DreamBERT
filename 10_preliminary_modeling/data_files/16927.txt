There's a meeting between members of a band I used to be in. Jude the singer is there, but I don't remember the others. The plan is to reform the band and to do a series of gigs. But instead of doing it seriously, the plan is to be a spoof of our former selves - a kind of 'Spinal Tap'. Some of the band are up for this, including Jude (who immediately takes the idea extremely seriously), and thinks of a new name for the band, and lyrics for the first song within seconds. One or two of the others are less keen - they want to be taken seriously as a proper band. One of them (the drummer) just doesn't want to commit the time. I make a compromise offer - we'll do a one-off gig - just one. Everyone agrees and we all shake hands.
