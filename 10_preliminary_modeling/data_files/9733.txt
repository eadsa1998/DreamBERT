Large crowd: like a Mardi Gras at Church: many cars parked: one sideways, near the pulpit at the altar; Father Andrew and Marissa sit at the table next to me; I am with the kids; Zena grabs some blowers from the table (next to her): Father Andrew goes over and returns them and apologizes for Zena. (!) Then he asks me to go with him to get groceries and clothes from a Co-op. Peter Steele has to sign the slip; I take out from a freezer: vegetables and frozen meat: "Is that alright Father?" "Yes"; then Father Andrew gets new altar things and has them sent home; I feel very happy - we all go back to the Church and sit at table together, but then they drive off before we do.
