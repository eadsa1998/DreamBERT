The entire cast of West Wing was in this dream. Martin Sheen had died and we were attending the visitation service. In the dream this was not part of the TV program but it was what would have been a waking life events. I was there at the visitation services will everyone was very sad but I seemed unusually distraught and emotional. I don't know why but I was crying a lot. As typically happens at visitation services, there are a lot of discussions about him, the man that he was. Some people felt that he should have truly been president.
