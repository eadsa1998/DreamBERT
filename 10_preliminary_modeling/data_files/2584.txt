I am going to the White House to meet the President of the U.S. He is a bachelor. I have to go down to the basement and get clearance. I am aware in the dream of a feeling that I look very good and I am to be respected and then he will fall in love with me. I look around for the woman who gives clearance. She is not around. I am tempted to just go up the back steps, but decide to do it right so I won't get into trouble. I open a door and find the woman who is very fat, like 500 ton or 1,000 lbs. She is lying down and uncomfortable. There is a mirror near her head like a pillow. A man (her husband) sits behind her head, facing me. He's there to help her, a co-dependent, lazy kind of guy. She is grumpy but gives clearance (permission). I go upstairs. The President opens the door; he's talking to someone and turns and does a double take as he sees me. He's already interested. I come in confident.
