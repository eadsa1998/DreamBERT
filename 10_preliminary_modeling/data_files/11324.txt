I dreamed that I was being chased by several gangsters through the streets of a small town. The streets of the town were very narrow and winding and four or five-story buildings were situation on each side of the street. I kept running down these streets, sometimes hiding in the buildings. However, most of the time I was on the run, and I began to think I would shake the gangsters off my trial. When they were just about ready to capture me, it was time to get up.
