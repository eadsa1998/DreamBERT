My friend and I were driving to Boston. When we were almost there I stopped at a gas station to get gas. While I was doing this an attendant came over and said I could park in his parking garage if I wanted to. I asked my friend and we both agreed to park there. We went to Faneuil Hall that night. When we came back to the garage at about 1:30, the parking garage was all lit up with very nice and expensive cars inside. (It looked like the parking area on top of Beacon Hill except it was lit up.) As I proceeded to my car I noticed that my tires were all flat. I was totally flipping out! I couldn't believe that all my tires were flat. Just then I saw out of the corner of my eye my best friend's ex-friend. We never got along in the first place, but when I became friends with my now best friend she became very jealous. She thought I stole her friend away from her. Which of course is quite far from the truth. Anyway, once I saw her I knew that she was the one who did it. I was so angry that I went over to her. She knew I was very angry, so she  started to run. So I ran after her but her boyfriend stopped me. I told her she is going to pay for everything that needed to be fixed on my car. Her boyfriend knew I meant it and even told her she better listen to me.
