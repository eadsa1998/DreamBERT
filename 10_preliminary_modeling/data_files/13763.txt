I got put into a higher level English class. I was getting a level four though. The order it went in (IB level English) was my class, other class, and then Ms Solomon. I was annoyed because I enjoyed having Elijah in the class. The class I got put into had Calvin and Evelyn in it for some reason. A leg on all the tables and chairs was broken. Mariam and Isabel were there. The teacher was female, but was then Mr Noonan.
