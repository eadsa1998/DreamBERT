I was in bed, and it was about 5:00 Saturday morning when the phone rang.  It was some guy who was directing a play I was supposed to be in, calling to say that we had a rehearsal right away, and the first performance the next day.  I remembered that we were supposed to have our lines memorized by this rehearsal, and I had only memorized my first two.  We had started rehearsing only that week.  I felt it was too rushed, I didn't know my lines, and I didn't feel like getting out of bed and going to a rehearsal at 5:00 a.m. on Saturday.  I told him that, either over the phone or at home.  It may have been the latter, because I remember being in his living room (paneled) with a lot of other people, and realizing that he and his family were Jewish.  Somehow I got out of playing my part without two much trouble considering that they were going to have to get someone to replace me.
