I was in a building on a beach.  Perhaps a changing house or bathroom.  There was a Japanese couple with a baby there.  They were talking to Scully and Mulder from the X-Files, I think.  Their baby was in the next room- they sounded scared for it.  I looked in- he seemed fine.  I busied myself again doing something else, and only half listening I started to understand some of the Japanese.  "Coming to come" or something along those lines.  Then I was in a house, looking for the bathroom.  One was taken, and I went to another.  No toilet.  Another, and again, no toilet.  I was perplexed and had to go!  I went back to the main room.  It was some sort of spirit that the Japanese family was afraid of.  I went back to the bathroom, scared, and that's when it happened.  I helped the couple out of the house and we ran.  The spirit was moving.  Everyone on the beachfront panicked.  The beach had a lot of people, and large concrete stadium style sitting steps.  I ran down them, past people, and at the base of the steps stopped at the opening of a drainage tunnel.  Blood was leaking out of the higher ones and I got some people to help block off these before it was too late to contain the spirit.  If the blood got out it would become airborne and kill everyone.  We stomped on the tubing that stuck out far enough to pinch off.  A bit later Mulder came out, and he said that what we were doing enabled him to do whatever was necessary in the house to rid it of the ghost.  We were safe.
