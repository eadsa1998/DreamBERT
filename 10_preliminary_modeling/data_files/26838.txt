 I get a phone call. It's late: either 2:00am, or 7:00am. It's my old girlfriend Jackie Hunter calling. I can barely hear her. She is talking strangely. I have recently spoken with her, before she called. She may be drunk-I think she is. She rambles on for a while, and eventually I hang up. A group of young people-my age- arrive back from a night of partying. I'm in the large bedroom upstairs at home in Oak Valley. The people want a place to sleep. The house is pretty crowded. My friend Nat Miller is there. My friend Stephen Ramos is in a smaller bed in the southwest corner of the room. His dog Spot is with him. Spot starts to bark and growl when the people come near him. I don't want these people (one woman and one or two men) to sleep just anywhere. I tell Nat he can sleep in my mom's room (she isn't here). Then I suggest the floor downstairs for the others, in an attempt to put some distance between them and I, so I still get a good night of sleep. One of the men suggests that he sleep in the bed with me. I don't like that idea: I would feel crowded. I remember the basement, and tell them that one can stay in the small bedroom, and the others in the family room.
