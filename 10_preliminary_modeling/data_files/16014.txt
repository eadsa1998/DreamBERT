We were having a party. Our house was very big and had multiple storeys. My room was massive and had seating in there and a big bed. Lots of people showed up, around 100. I went into my room at one point and saw a bunch of people sitting around and I coughed and then told everyone to get out and that no one was allowed in my room. I went out into the hall and this guy around 40-50 was there and put his around around my shoulders and was showing me something. He was clearly drunk. He pulled me close and his stubble scratched my face and he kissed me on the cheek as I squirmed to get away. I had to deliver something and there was a tunnel that was part of the Science Museum that went to where I needed to go. It was free to walk through but was underground and took about an hour or so. I got to this house and sat outside with my stuff and was writing/drawing/reading something and Granma came out, chipper, and asked if I was coming inside. I said I just wanted to finish this off first and she happily said ok and went back inside.
