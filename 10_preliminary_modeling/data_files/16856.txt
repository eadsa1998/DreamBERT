This dream feats authority figures from my past. I'm late for a meeting with my tutor - it appears I'm at university studying either art, horticulture or perhaps studying to be a chef. It keeps changing throughout the dream. I run from the train station to the large college campus. I have to register with an administrator - a stern woman who says I have to go straight in. I'm not very well prepared, but I go in holding a large portfolio. Inside a room there's a round table with the head of the course and a couple of other tutors sitting around it. They are talking amongst themselves. The course leader seems to know I'm late, yet deliberately keeps me waiting, ignoring me while he talks to his colleagues. The course leader is an amalgamation of several male authority figures from my past including teachers, bosses and my father. This man is quite scary. Eventually he turns his attention to me. He treats the interview in a dismissive way, as if writing me off from the start, thinking I'm not committed to this course. He points out that I have other commitments (for example a job). He talks up the other students enrolled on the course, saying how committed they are. He eventually agrees to give me a chance to prove myself. I use a bit of humor to attempt to break the ice, and it does seem to work  somewhat. I go to a classroom to join my fellow students, who are all engaged in doing something. I am very late for the class.
