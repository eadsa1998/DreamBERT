[1997-06-19] I was out on a lake in a boat fishing with my father in law and there were other people there too. They were all friends that I had from when I lived back in West Boston where I haven't lived for 10 or 11 years. The mix of the people confused me and I was trying to figure out from them how they got out in the boat and how I got out in the boat and I actually remember touching the boat, and it was his boat, his aluminum boat but the weirdest thing was that there were all of these people around and we were catching fish.
