Ann and Audrey went out. I was standing outside in Rivertown with a fellow from Gilmore. I heard a rumbling or thunder in that direction. I said, "There's no storm coming because there's no clouds." Then all at once black clouds seemed to come off the earth like smoke and form a big storm. I called for Ann and Audrey to come home because there was a storm coming up. I saw a maneuver of our Army trucks at night that fooled and puzzled the enemy from attack. It seemed to be a triangle shape where the trucks drove or kept driving to the front of the triangle and then backing to the rear and keeping up this movement. The arrangement seemed to puzzle the enemy. I was in a hardware store. A young fellow was working. He had a pair of pliers and wanted to open catter pins. I took the pliers and said, "Someone should invent pliers that when you squeeze down on them, the jaws would open up and open the catter pin." I saw Al Lasko. He showed me his teeth. The front uppers fell out when he wanted them to. They flew out on the floor and then they flew back into place. He seemed to have a string attached to them. I said, "Let me see your teeth," and he opened his mouth and I looked into it. He had an arrangement of a mirror in his mouth which showed teeth in his mouth all over. I was on a shanty. I let myself down by holding on the side of the roof. I was sitting on a box car. I moved it at east back or forth, then I put on the brake. I saw or heard Xippi Pigeon.
