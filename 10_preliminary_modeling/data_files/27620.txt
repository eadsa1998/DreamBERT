I was with a person I couldn't recognize, but in my dream I seemed to know her. We decided to take a swim and a sunbath so we walked along the beach trying to decide when would be a good place to stop. There was a sand-castle that some little boy had made. I stopped-fascinated by the castle. All of a sudden we looked around, realized that we couldn't see any sign of people. We seemed to be entirely alone, but neither ore of us were frightened.
