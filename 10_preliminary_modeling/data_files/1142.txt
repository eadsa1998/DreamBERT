A large man with large hands and head like my grandfather Lloyd in body shape, but my age, loves me. I love him and I'm very surprised that I do. I tell him he's not the type I've been dreaming about for years. He's quiet, strong, sure of himself and emotionally supportive. I am very drawn to him but I'm afraid because I might soon get bored with him and then become attracted to another man who is adventurous, rich, and handsome. Then, I become very aware that this quiet man is exactly what I need; that there is challenge, risk, and adventure in inwardly, introspective ways. We hug. I kiss him. He puts his penis in my vagina. I help him and then I'm embarrassed because we're standing up, fully clothed and in a hallway. People could easily see us. I tell him this. He pulls back and apologizes. He says he's sorry. He just loves me so much that he couldn't wait. Then he says he knows how wrong he was. I feel like dismissing all my former bad thoughts about his actions. I do so. Later, we are making love. It is wonderful. Then doors need to be shut to keep out the upsurge of the ocean, so we want doors. I rush and shut the doors and I feel fear that it will get in anyway. An equal relationship in both of us loving each other. I feel a tremendous sense of security and relief. Finally I love someone and he's right for me.
