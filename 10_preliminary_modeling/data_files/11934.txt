I was at some shop/Timezone place with David Anders (we were friends). I turned around to say something fusty and then I 'dreamt' what would happen, I can't remember what was said, but it turned out badly. When I finished the 'dream', I couldn't find him. I think I found him again and I 'dreamt' again and I saw Jennifer Garner and he was making out with her. Then I finished that dream, and I don't remember what happened properly, but we found out that we liked each other and then we supposedly had sex, which I don't remember and then we were lying in bed and he said something about some Banana in Pajama's banana's penis and I said something how he couldn't have sex because it was probably smushed when he was born.
