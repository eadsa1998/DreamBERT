Dad, Ezra and I were on a plane. Ezra and I were sitting next to each other and Dad was behind us. A guy was willing to swap but then I couldn't be next to the window. Then we were in America. We were stopping there for a day or two, then going to the UK. I took a photo of a street sign. There was a koala and I said to Dad that I had a dream about a killer one the other day. Then just Dad and I were in the UK. There was a building where they had shot Friends and pictures of the cast were all around the walls. Lisa Kudrow was outside having pictures taken and I took a photo. Then Matthew Perry came out and I was excited and got a photo taken with him.
