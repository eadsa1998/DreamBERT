I was playing Grand Theft Auto IV. Then it was a movie. It stayed close to the game though and as the main character was driving down the road, he was weaving in and out of traffic (like in the game). I was also doing something on Runescape. Then Dad and I were walking somewhere. I had a snake but it bit me, so I let it go.
