I was coming back on a plane with Ezra. As we were landing we were going towards stuff that was on the runway and the pilot turned and we spun around and went into the water. We got out easily. I went to the toilet and I wrote this letter and donated this book etc and then put it in the bin. I changed my mind and took them back. I went through a scanner thing and it beeped so I emptied all my stuff. This lady said "I miss Michael (she was reading from my letter)... Have you got a boyfriend?" and I said "No". There was a wig with my stuff and I said "oh, that's not mine". Mom was there too. Also, she would send Rover on flights all the time because he liked them.
