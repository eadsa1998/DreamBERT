 I'm crossing a muddy river with a bicycle. The river is coming from melt water. I slip and fall, almost going in a deep part of the river. I get up, and hang onto the mountain bike with one hand. I slip again. The bottom of the river is slippery. I struggle to get to the side of the river, and I do. There is a stairway with metal pegs sticking out. I can use the pegs to climb. <br/
