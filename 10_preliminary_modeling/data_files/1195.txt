I am a wondrous creature from another planet. No one knows. I live with a family. I go up an attic hole to a special room where I can connect with my power machine when needed. I am warned by my "younger brother" that some member of the family is my deadly enemy, one of my own kind. I use my x-ray vision and see that it is my "older brother." We lock into deadly combat. It's all I can do to just hang on to his head so his teeth don't sink into me! We struggle for a long time, growling and hissing. He gets his teeth into my finger. I feel the pain and grow weary of feeling it. My "younger brother" comes to my rescue and holds its head by the hair. We are in the air, going higher than the buildings. I am growing tired. He knows it and waits. He knows he's stronger than me. He taunts me and smiles. He offers me his wallet that has little red energy pills and some green herbal stuff that he uses to grow strength with. I crumple it all up and I drift down to the Earth. He is surprised. He expected me to eat it so he would have me. I suddenly grow very long and powerful and zap him with a death ray. I had to be so quick because if I didn't go fast enough, he'd counter and reflect it back to me. I went so fast, that I had no time to warn my "younger brother." I had to kill him too. I knew that. I am sad about it but it was necessary for my survival. I send the message, "I'm sorry" right after the death ray. It surprises my enemy. He didn't know that I had matured enough to have this capability. He explodes into a million pieces and drifts to Earth. So does my "younger brother".
