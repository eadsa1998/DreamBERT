[1997-05-30] I was looking for books from a Braille Bible and I had to give some kind of report or do something in church, was looking for a particular book and was having trouble finding it. My friend S was there and while I was feeling around on the shelves trying to find the books I happened to notice there was a nice bugle on the floor. It seemed to have 2 bells on it instead of just one. I thought to myself, "Ooh, as soon as I'm done finding these books I've got to ask S about playing that bugle, see what it sounds like."
