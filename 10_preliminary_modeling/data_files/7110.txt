I saw the train coming. Then we all got on. A lady across the aisle was working on numberous slips of paper about 1 x 2 inches. A man came to help her. He was to take the slips off the train and needed a bag for them. The train didn't start and finally I got up and asked if this wasn't the train for Cedar Rapids. It was.
