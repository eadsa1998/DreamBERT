I was watching Saturday Night Live and they were doing a parody of Fantasy Island. There were six huge muscular men holding back Tattoo. They were like those really butch gay men in leather and wearing black leather pants and vests. They won't let Tattoo go and he keeps saying, "Let me go, let me go, I need to go." Finally they let Tattoo go and he runs to this huge puff of smoke. Then Tattoo says to the men, "Do you see what happened? You didn't let me warn him." It was never stated, but the moral was that since Tattoo could not warn Ricardo Montablan about the plane, the plane hit him.
