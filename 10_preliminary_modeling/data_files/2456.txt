I am Deana of Star Trek, we are on a mission. A she-devil comes and tells me she's got total control of me, or soon will, so I might as well stop struggling. I feel her mind take over mine and I feel angry and helpless. I struggle. She laughs and lays me down and she lays down with me and starts to kiss me. I feel overwhelmed and fight the desire to let go and succumb to her. I growl deep in my throat and I see I have a wolf muzzle and I bare my teeth and growl as forcefully as I can. This almost makes me as powerful as her and I am able to resist just enough to pull away from her. I run to where the crew is being held captive and I must choose the right packet. I don't know which one to choose. She's laughing at me. Her henchman is holding the two packets at me, smiling. The first officer is like Harry Anderson of Night Court and he's furious and disgusted with me for giving in or not having enough strength to fight. He grabs one of the packets and I bellow, "I choose that one." Then I must read the names of the crew from the packet. I can't recognize the names and he has to help me with the pronunciations. He jeers at me in disgust that I could forget my own crew. I am furious at him and in a way its my only salvation. As long as I concentrate on my anger at him, I can still fight her strong seduction. I successfully call them all and they are free to go. They and I run for the elevator. I am screaming in terror and agony the whole way. The elevator is long and narrow. I go to a back corner and cower, sobbing and screaming. He still relentlessly despises me. A medic examines me and tells him the she-devil had replaced my brain cells with hers. It was a miracle I could hang on as long as I did to a thread of consciousness of my own being. He replaces my own cells so I can be myself again. Harry is sad that he misjudged me so.
