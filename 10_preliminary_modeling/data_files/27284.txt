I was floating in Lake Erie, and although I did not recognize the site, I had this firm conviction it was off 72nd street. As I floated further out, the land took on the appearance of the Shore Drive, except that it ran diagonally from 72nd St. to E. 9th, which seemed a great deal further inland than it actually is. I drifted farther out with apparent unconcern until I noticed the water was becoming scummy and filled with debris. I then became alarmed and thrashed around in the water, but became tired quickly and ceased to struggle, continuing to float.
