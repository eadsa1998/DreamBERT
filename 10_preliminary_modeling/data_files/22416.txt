It went like this: I was invited to a party and my escort had given me the written invitation for me to keep. The day of the party arrived and my escort, who is a boy from my class, went to pick me up at my home and then the problems started. I couldn't find the invitation that we needed to go to the party and didn't know how to tell him. Then I saw myself with him, waiting in line, and with all my classmates too, in the school yard. He is a very shy and reserved boy and doesn't like parties.
