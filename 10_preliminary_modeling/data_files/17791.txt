We were at my maternal Grandma Jane's house and an elderly neighbor lady stopped by.  She wanted to get rid of a bunch of robes she had.  Surprisingly everyone in our family took one, even my father and my brother Stuart.  Then she wanted help disposing of something else- car oil, I think.  It took a while and there was much more involved in it than we'd planned, but we did that as well.  When we got back, though, she was in the corridor past the porch where some cats were hanging around.  She was knocking on the door trying to get in to talk to my mother some more- at this point she had gotten annoying and was probably wanting the attention more than anything- we knew she wouldn't leave us alone, and we didn't want her there for dinner.
