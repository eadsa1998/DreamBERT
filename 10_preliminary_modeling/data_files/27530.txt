I dreamt that my parents were planning a dinner party for 7:00. Preparations were not yet completed when the doorbell rang and our guests arrived. They were a middle-aged doctor and his wife, actual friends of ours. Mother was dressed in a black and white checked dress and in general the house was in an uproar. We seated our guests at a small table for two. There were two other large tables. one of these tables was occupied by Mother and Dad and several other relatives whom I can't remember. I too, sat with them. The third table was occupied by a group of unknowns, among whom were two girls who had been called to serve that evening. We proceeded with our meal and serving was done in a very inefficient manner. We had chicken, some sort of potatoes and green peas which were dished out into small plates. It seemed to take ages until all the tables were served from the central table where we sat. I kept thinking there wouldn't be enough to go around. Our two guests conversed continually with one another. I noticed that the table was littered with empty ginger ale bottles and told the two girls to clear them away.
