I was outside a shop. Rodney kept getting attacked by a dog. I was walking and Rodney and I both reached his house then the dog attacked him and I went inside. He ran and hid in his bedroom and I hid in another. I thought that it was Eugene's, but a sign said "Goren" and I realized that that was Darius's brother. I left the room when the dog wasn't in sight and ran to the room next to Rodney's, which was Eugene's. Then Rodney was Ezra and the room was made of pillows. They were 'turning' into strawberries. Later I was at school and Evelyn was around. I wanted to go to a house, but she didn't.
