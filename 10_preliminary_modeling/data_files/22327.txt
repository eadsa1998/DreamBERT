The dream of today was similar to that of yesterday, except for the fact that the two girls that I am going with appeared. I was between them, though far away. (I must note that I am having a problem and it is that I don't know with which to stay, because I love them both the same.) Then one of them started to call me, but I didn't know which one it was. Then I continued looking at the sky and so I fell asleep, in the dream, that is.
