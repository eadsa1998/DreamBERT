 I'm at Carter School. I have a key and I enter the south door near the gymnasium. I see that the gates in the halls are up. My friend Kevin Simpson is out in front of the school. I go to the north entrance, outside, near the daycare. I look in the door there. I'm going to enter. A man inside catches me looking in and notices I have a key. He asks me suspiciously what I'm doing there. He calls security, whom I know to be the principal Candy Bevner. I have a pair of turquoise rubber gloves for washing dishes. I put these on with the key inside them, but the man and another woman notice my actions of secrecy.
