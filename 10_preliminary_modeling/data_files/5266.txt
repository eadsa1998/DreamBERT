First I dreamed that I was babysitting Layla. I was trying to do everything perfectly since her dad was my soccer coach. We went to the ocean and came back to her house to bake cookies. We were just rolling out the dough when her mom came back and paid me. Next, I was in some really fancy modern Japanese-style house. Every time I finished a homework assignment, I was allowed to get up and get a piece of candy. The thing was --the assignments never seemed to end. No sooner would I finish one then I would have another one. Finally it was study hall and I was working with Ava, Isaiah, and Beth. It was weird because I think Isaiah liked me. Then I woke up.
