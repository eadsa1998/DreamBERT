I dreamed that Mr. Winter was brainwashing us by interpreting The Great Gatsby incorrectly. Haley and I were the only ones in the class who knew and we both freaked out and ran away. We were on a train somewhere, a really huge train, like the size of a mall. I somehow knew the train was going to be hijacked, so we got off at Ed's house. There, I made plans for us to get picked up. When I went to get out of bed (that's where I was emailing from, I guess), I discovered that I was naked. I found some way to trick Ed into not looking at me while I ran away. I found a pay phone, but I needed 12 quarters to make a call. I wanted to call my mother to tell her I would be home late, but then I heard her calling my name, and I think she was in real life, which is why I woke up.
