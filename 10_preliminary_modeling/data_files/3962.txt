["Uncle Wilbur's empty eye."]  Sebastian and I are talking. Working on a project. He says perhaps we are all done working with each other now. All our projects together are done.  I feel mild regret. Now I see Uncle Wilbur and go sit on his lap. I look into his eye to see an empty eye socket, with some mechanical device inside which used to hold his eye. There are people around who are mean and grumpy.
