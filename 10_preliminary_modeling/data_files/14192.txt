I was at home, out the back. I was with Ben (Lost) and some others. Sawyer (Lost) was one of them. We planned to break into a casino. At first it was just to steal something from a smaller place, but he changed it to a casino. We were in the garage at a table. Then there were other tables around and it was a McDonald's. The roller door was open and Ben said it was so people would think it was a distraction. He wanted it closed a certain way and I asked why not just lock it there and he agreed, so I did that. Ben was a leader-ish guy and decided to go his own way since no-one in the group had listened to him. He went inside. They were saying that he was "hot enough" to do that. Ben was then a bad guy. I decided to go with him. I went in and locked the door and put the metal rod in so it couldn't be opened. He asked me why someone of "high morals" would decide to go to the "dark side". There were two drag queens who kept trying to be a part of the group. We wanted one of them, but not the other so we were trying to trick them. Then Brad Pitt was part of the group. We were breaking in somewhere. Then Ben had this huge room with replica casinos everywhere. When we first opened the door, Mom was in there. Then someone turned around and said "hey Mom". Some of the people were wearing SWAT like gear and had guns. One of the casinos there had those red sensor beam things.
