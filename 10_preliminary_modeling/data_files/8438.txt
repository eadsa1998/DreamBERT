I think that I was visiting some kind of, almost reminds me of when I stayed at the Sequoia's in CA for a residency. I had walked to someone's cabin. I don't remember whose or why. After I left I was having trouble remembering how to get back to my own cabin. I walked one direction and I saw a big highway and knew that wasn't the right direction because I hadn't seen it before. Then I started another direction and ran into someone else and said I was having trouble remembering how to get back. I think that he was going to help me. I mentioned the highway that I saw. I think he said something to the effect that he didn't even know it was there. There was also something in the dream about a costume but I don't know what it was, what it was for or anything else. Then there was a discussion, I think as I was walking I ran into another couple that I started a conversation with. We sat down to talk for a little while and they ended up discussing a possible job opportunity. I talked to them quite a bit. I didn't tell them that I didn't think it was the right thing for me. There was some kind of trust or morality issue. Apparently I was there with a bunch of people I knew. Later I was in a room with these people and they come up to. They were fairly upset because they had heard that I had said something to someone about our conversation. I said that I had to tell the person I was supposed to meet because I was late due to my conversation with them. I had to tell that person something to explain why I was late. I just said I was talking with them, not what we discussed. I don't know if the person I met told them I had said something to him about a job opportunity or what. I think they assumed that I told him what we talked about.
