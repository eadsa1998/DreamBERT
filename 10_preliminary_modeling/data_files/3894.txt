["Stopping Incest."] I am talking with some movie director and I vaguely notice that he is being flirty and seductive with a young 14 year old girl. I don't feel good about it qnd am about to turn away and leave, when it occurs to me that I can stop it. I turn back to him and I say. That is incest. ( sexual abuse) and if you even think about it, I will call Children's Services Division in and tell them. He is angry and shocked. He defends himself saying its all innocent fun and I'm reacting too strongly. I continue my statement making it clerar I mean business. He backs off.
