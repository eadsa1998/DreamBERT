I'm at a big house with a big pool behind it, a kind of meeting place/resort - you book into it for parties or suchlike, and I'm here as part of something, but wanting to leave. I've been in the house with my friend, and now I'm just going out past the pool, but lo and behold, down at this end you have to walk into the water on wood steps and things. Crossing to a kind of raft-thing, I then find there's no more steps all the way through this barn-like structure to the outside. I'm at a loss for a while - I'm in shorts, etc., not dressed for swimming, and not keen on it anyway. But I guess I have to, so I get down into it and find I can tread okay, I don't sink in all the way. I go on out and then realize I've left my purse and notebook on the raft. Damn. I have to go back for them, no help for it, so I do. There are a lot more people on it now, and I'm worried for a minute that my purse may not be there, but it is, almost under some others and between a couple of women sitting on each side. I get my things and [go out again? no continuity.]
