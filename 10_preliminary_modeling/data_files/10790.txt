I was back working at Marshall Field and Co. in Chicago. It was quitting time and my girlfriend (20) and I were riding down the escalator accompanied by a friend of ours. He is a very overweight person, age 32, and dressed in a striking manner. Flag red shirt, Kelley green jacket and brown trousers. He was acting up in a rather loud manner just to be funny, and to us he looked at the moment so awful we ran to get away. To more or less disown the actions of this friend. But the more we ran, the more he chased us.
