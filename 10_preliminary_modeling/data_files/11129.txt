I was tap dancing on the stage at the Statler Hotel in Cleveland when my parents came in and went backstage to wait for me. They told me that they would lock me in my closet if I didn't stop dancing. I didn't pay any attention, I guess, because I was dancing the next thing I knew. When I went home, all I could see inside the house was the dark closet. As soon as I went inside, the door locked behind me. I groaned and moaned (my roommate heard this). My roommate came over and woke me up. It was horrible.
