We were out riding in the car. I was in the back seat. Daddy was driving. Another couple was in the front seat with him, but I don't know who they were. Mother was in the back seat, sitting at my right. We were driving along and all of a sudden we stopped and there was a big woods next to us and it was on fire. Daddy and the other couple got out and started fighting the fire. All of a sudden, I got afraid that the car would catch on fire so I kept telling my mother, "Come on, get out, get out, get out!" She was very calm and very serene, like she always is. So I got out and I began to smell the smell of gas and I knew the car was beginning to catch on fire and I woke up. Q: Did you notice any other sensory effects about the fire besides that of smell? A: No. Q: Have you ever been in or to a fire? A: No, just bonfires. Q: Haven't you noticed how noisy a fire can be? A: Oh yes. Well, I didn't hear the fire in my dreams. I wasn't that close. Q: Then why did you fear that the car would catch fire? A: I don't know. Q: Did you notice that everybody got out of the car but your mother and when you woke up, she was still in the car? A: Well, but I told her to get out and she wouldn't; she just sat there, calm and serene. Q: Were you "burned up" at your mother that day? A: Well, the only thing I can think of at all is that she told me to be cautious and I don't like her telling me to be careful, and I did blow up about that. I told her what I thought and where to go. In this case I resented it because I was enjoying myself. At least you should enjoy yourself while you can. If I want to get my fingers burned, well, let me.
