In the first dream there is a Russian and I am an American and he likes me and I like him. We flirt and enjoy each other. Later, there is another man and I want to feel the same way with him, only it isn't working out. It's boring. We are in a car and I want to find some food to eat, like a sack lunch or picnic. I find some stuff between the door and the front seat, but it isn't all that appetizing. I notice a high wind coming and we run for an old dilapidated barn for cover. We get in and there is no way to close an old broken wooden window, no glass. We go to a corner and sit on a hay-strewn bench. I look out and see entire groves of trees being smashed by the force of the wind. Fortunately this is barren country and not much around to be destroyed. I try to feel good about cuddling up with this guy, but it is boring. There is nothing in the barn but us, the wooden bench and some bits of hay.
