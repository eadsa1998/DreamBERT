I go to a hotel check in desk. I say to the male clerk, "I want to make reservations here and also at the retreat up in the mountains." He is quite frosty and says, "We have no vacancy." I say, "I wish to go to the mountain retreat first and then come back here to rest during the week." "Ah," he says. "Very well." He starts to write up my reservations. A young woman/girl comes up to me. She used to be a client and starts talking to me. I say to her, "I'm here for a rest and I really don't want to hear you right now." She doesn't like that and sighs. She sneaks in the comment that that is O.K., even if she is going to get married to her step-father, who is a really mean man, and even though she really needs to talk to me. I feel guilty and caught all at the same time. I want alone time but it's obvious she is going to talk to me. I give in. I then do some role-playing with her. I point out how she drops eye contact and turns her body away from me. She says, "Oh, that's very interesting." The clerk suggests that we crash the party and if it gets wild, he'll put his hand over his rosebud boutonniere and I'll adjust my rosebud corsage. That will mean we will meet at the car. I ask him to show me the gesture so I'll recognize the signal. He does it. I see his hand is brown, small and pudgy, child like. I repeat the instructions and hope I don't forget. We go to the party. I'm wearing a long formal gown and I have one high heeled shoe on and one off. I walk on tiptoes with the right foot and hope no one notices my missing shoe. There is a buffet table. Lots of high class snotty women. I'm dishing up food into my plate. A tooth with a feather on it falls out of my mouth onto the table. I am embarrassed. I say nonchalantly, "Oh, pardon," very French-like and classy. I pick it up. It reminds me of an engagement ring. I feel the empty place with my tongue. I realize there had been another one that fell out sometime earlier.
