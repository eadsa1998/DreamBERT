I was at some kind of family event. Bruce W and Carl W were both there. I was talking to Carl W and telling him how nice it was to see him since he never gets to family reunions. I was saying something about him still being single, which he isn't in waking life, and he reminded me that he was married and that it was Bruce W that was still single. I was thinking about having an attraction to Bruce W and that I was glad or something that he was still single. However, I quickly thought how inappropriate it was to be attracted to him as he is my first cousin. I think, though, that the attraction was mutual.
