I was thinking that I needed to water my plants and give them some attention. I realized that I had not been watering the ones on the screened porch. The porch was a long narrow room, not much wider than a hallway. It looked unfinished, like bare wood or at least wood that had just been stained, but not finished. I was also thinking about the African violets on the kitchen windowsill.
