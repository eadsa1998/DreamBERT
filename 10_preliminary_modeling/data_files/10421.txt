At a place like the Retreat Center: we are in a basement kitchen where people are baking tasty cakes; I have to leave and must climb up a very STEEP WALL, by placing hooks in the wall for footholds. People are not very helpful. I eat a piece of cake and try once again, not sure if I make it or fall down?
