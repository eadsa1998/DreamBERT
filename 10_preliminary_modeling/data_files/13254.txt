I was at school. Calvin was around. Eugene and I were going to the homework centre. I called Mom and this girl nearby said "Why do you have to call? That's so gay". I thought I saw Dad's car. I went to the library but we didn't have our library cards. I was thinking 'that's why you should give us a new one every year'. They gave me a new one and I didn't need the permission form to stay.
