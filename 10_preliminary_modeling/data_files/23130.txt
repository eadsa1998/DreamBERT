I was in some mountains, looking down at a very large lake far below.  You could hardly tell it was a lake because the water was so clear and did not refract light, so you could see the green fields of a meadow beneath it just as if you had been looking down on it from an airplane.  The name was Long Lake.  There was a steep, narrow gravel pathway going all the way down the hillside to the lake.  I thought it would be fun to go down it on a bike, but I didn't know how safe or easy it would be, because of the gravel, and I didn't know how difficult it would be coming back up, or if there was another way.  I saw Jackson Weinstein riding his bike up the trail, so I thought I would wait for him and ask him.
