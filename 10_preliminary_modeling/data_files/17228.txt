It was night, but I was trying to get back to school from home for class.  My mother kept delaying.  We drove around, came home.  Around the block again, and home.  I was anxious, but she said we had enough time.  I kept thinking we were leaving.  She wanted to take a walk.  Turned back, and faced bees.  Home again, and the door was open.  Ran in and yelled to see who was there.  My brother Stuart was in the bathroom with my boyfriend Jeremy, and my roommate Chelsea and several others were planning a party.  Jeremy had made a script.  I was to pop my head out of a pumpkin as a Saturday Night Live commercial.  We gave it up.  Jeremy was going to go to Raging Waters.  He got on a bus.  I followed, and tried to grab all my stuff.  I was on crutches.  Former RA Dianne suggested something about riding him, so I straddled him, ready to have sex.  But Jeremy got up, distracted by thought.
