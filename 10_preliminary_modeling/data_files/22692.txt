I dreamt about my boyfriend. He kissed me passionately and I didn't feel any emotion. Instead, I rejected him. One could almost say it was a boxing match, because I was trying to get away and he hugged me with such strength that it seemed as though my ribs would break. I couldn't breathe well; each time he kissed me, I felt asphyxiated. He seemed like a beast, as though he wanted to eat, instead of petting or kissing me. I was shaking from head to toe and this seemed to please him, because he would look at me and laugh, and when he laughed, I felt him biting my ear, and my anguish and desperation were such that I felt I was going to die.
