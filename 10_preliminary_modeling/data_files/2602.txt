I am combing my long hair, which is bleached blonde and dark together, maybe like growing out roots. I'd pull a loose hair and great strands would come out in my hand. I am appalled. I'll be bald soon at this rate. Then I look in the mirror. I see that when I lift up my blonde/dark hair that new growth is coming in and it's pure white. I am shocked and go into the next room to show Aunt Abigail and Dwight. I hold up the blonde/dark hair with my brush and say, "Look at this!" They look. Aunt Abigail exclaims, "It's all white." Dwight refuses to look and sings or chants nonsense words. I call Aunt Abigail "Elaine" and then realize my mistake and apologize to her. I am annoyed with Dwight. I tell him so. I say, "Hey, this is a traumatic moment here and you aren't being very responsive." He just chants louder. I am angry and then feel forgiveness. That's the best he can do. I don't need his approval (help), although it would be nice. I go out into another room and my father (at his age now, maybe even older) comes in and has a box. He says, "It took some doing to get it from the rich old guy, but I got it." He and I unpack it carefully. It's a shamrock vase. It's a special ceramic crock to mix the special "healing" potion in. It's upside down and we carefully put it right side up. I blow dust off it and have decided to wash it thoroughly before we start. If we're going to all this trouble, we might as well do it right. There's something about finding other stuff and Aunt Abigail. My father and I carry the vase to another room. I look toward a window. We are talking. He says, "We don't take the bus. We drive in each time we see the doctor. It's easier that way." I nod and notice a big "fatty tumor" on his ear and he has a fat lip. He looks old and a little ill. I feel a bit of concern.
