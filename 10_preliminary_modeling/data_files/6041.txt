This dream was ultimately strange and [illegible] enough. I remembered it before I was going to bed (on the next night of the dream). I was at Suffolk and I remember walking up the stairs to the State House Arena across from the Fenton Building. But, there was a house, a huge house with a big fence around it and it had grand doors (like doors on a church - wooden and carved). I went inside and walked up these very steep, narrow stairs to use the bathroom. (I don't know how I knew it was upstairs.) Anyway, there were a lot of people downstairs like a party was going on and as I closed the door to the bathroom a girl walked by the hall and called for her mother. Suddenly the mother appeared and directly asked me to leave. She said this was not the haunted house (?) And she was sick of "those" students looking for it and she wished they would get the address right. Feeling really sad, I left. But as I was leaving in the yard playing ping pong, with many people standing around watching, was Al Pacino. (I guess it was his house??)
