I was on my way home from school with a big heavy suitcase in one hand and my typewriter in another. I had walked quite a distance before tiring, but now I was exhausted. However, there were two people in back of me who were rushing to catch the Berea bus as I was, so I put all my strength to keep up with them. It bothered me that neither of them offered to help me. Suddenly a bus went by, but I didn't know whether it was a Berea bus or a Cleveland transit bus, because the sides were green like the Berea buses, but the back was yellow like the CJS buses. Somehow I seemed to overtake the bus and the front was also green but I couldn't see the sign telling of its destination. The bus was suddenly gone and I kept walking. There were two little girls in front of me pulling a sled and I asked them if I could put my baggage on the sled. I did and held it to keep it balanced.
