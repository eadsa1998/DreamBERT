["Love In Space."] I am at the end of a school term and have finished writing my last paper. I'm in a hurry to take off so I start gathering things up. I find two collage pictures I had made and quickly begin to scrape off the magazine cutouts of people when I get the feeling I shouldn't be doing this. This was a meaningful creative piece and I am destroying it without thought. I do it to a second one as well. I am gathering up small objects out of drawers and so on. I look through a shelf of books. I am hearing some report on how A movie company in Russia wants to film in real outer space but the story isn't even about outer space, it's about love. I think to myself, huh! Leave it to the Russians. and then the narrator says NASA won't even let people do this not for a lot of money even. I think to myself, They do now, I heard they did.
