I am in a pickup truck in the driveway of Aunt Elaine's house and it starts sliding backwards. It rolls across a busy street and into the driveway across the street. I press and press on the brakes. It finally stops. I watch the traffic, which is fast and thick, for an opening so I can go back to Elaine's house. I watch one person passing another recklessly and think, "How dumb." Finally I get across. I want to take a shower, but I tell someone that Arvonne lives in the house now and I'd have to ask her. That seems an impossible task "You know Arvonne." I shrug my shoulders.
