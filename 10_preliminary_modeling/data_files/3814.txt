["Writing again."] I go into a room. I see a writing pad and remember I want to write. At first it is tedious, but I get going and it is fun again. I realize I must write thousands of pages and just keep writing. To get to the good stuff. I am now looking for more yellow pads to write on. I go into another room and I see Nate. Another man is there also, who seems supportive of me. I roll out a very long measuring tape which is at least 4 inches wide and many feet long. I make a joke and Nate and I laugh. I am carefully rolling the tape back up which I see has many pages and notes attached to the inside of it and I don't want to wrinkle them or lose them. Nate asks me to tell him what the notes say but I tell him I can't manage rolling it up neatly and reading the notes at the same time.
