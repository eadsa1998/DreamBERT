I was lying on my stomach on a large double bed. Another man was in the bed. A patient on my ward in real life came and asked me if I would like him to massage my legs. (This patient has confided to various patients that he had obtained money as a male prostitute before he was confined. He is young and good-looking. He has been here a few months.) I allowed him to massage my legs, and while he was doing it, I had an emission, though I tried o repress it. After he left, I felt the semen, and it felt like ear wax.
