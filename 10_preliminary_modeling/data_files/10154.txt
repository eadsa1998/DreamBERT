We are on a TRAIN to the Retreat Center; see the familiar mountain scenery with snow on the mountain tops; We arrive at a station; a RR guy walks by our window and grabs my address book that I was holding in my left hand; he finally returns it; Then there is confusion -- we are whisked back home and again whisked back on the train.
