I am at a big gathering: we are in danger - imprisoned? Then we are suddenly delivered and freed! Everyone starts ordering food, esp. hamburgers. I walk with a woman and we talk about movies that are somewhat risque. Then we walk through a big dining hall and I see ANNE CALOTT and DEMI M. (church women) - very clear. They order food for me, fried things, etc. Then they tell me that KIM is getting married "to a nice guy." House looks like one in Vienna.! Finally I leave the house through a glass door and realize that I can observe all the kids through it and see them come and go. I have forgotten my black raincoat. (Don't own a black raincoat.)
