The setting was a street scene, apparently during a northern winter as there were large piles of snow on the streets. There was a large number of people standing in front of a house and people were taking turns singing songs. These were not Christmas carols, but individual songs. The person in charge of the group and standing in front of him was a woman. I believe my sister was standing next to me, and during this part of the dream it seemed as though I were a teenager. None of the other people in the group were familiar. Some young girl about elementary school age was singing a song while we were standing there and singing it rather badly, somewhat in a PTA fashion. I remember pivoting back and forth in the place that I was standing, sort of hollowing out a spot in the snow with my feet while doing so. Then it seemed as though my attention were focused on the house in front of us. It was a large, white house, about a 3-story house with many stained glass windows that could be seen. While looking at the house, it seemed as if I were now an adult, and I was concerned with the problem of selling this house as it belonged to Doris and me. Some other family was living there at the present time, and I was thinking about all of the problems of trying to sell it and having prospective buyers view the house while this other family was living there. I remember thinking what a relief it will be when all of the confusion is finally over and the house is sold and we had closure on the property.
