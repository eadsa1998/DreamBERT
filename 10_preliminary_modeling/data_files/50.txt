I'm in the front of a bus with a friend, we have an errand or purpose together wherever we're going - there's another girl near us, sitting down (we're standing) and she's at odds with us in some way - perhaps we're suspicious of her, as though she were prying into our business. It's either night or late afternoon, and we're all dressed as if for work, and I believe we have coats on, maybe even hats and gloves. I'm sure we're all three "girls".
