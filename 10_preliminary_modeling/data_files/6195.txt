I dreamt that I woke up next to my girlfriend (which is not altogether unusual, as we spend most nights together), or rather, my former girlfriend as we have broken up but still sleep together. Sounds odd, I know, but it seems to work for us. So I woke up and noticed how pretty she is (I commented on this to myself in the dream) and just kept looking. I was feeling her side, just above her hips, (which I also found to be beautiful and commented to myself accordingly). I kissed her shoulder and her neck just below the ear and climbed out of bed to smoke a cigarette. Next thing I know I am dressed and smoking and taking a leak into the toilet. I go back to the bedroom because it is warm in there and I felt very cold in the rest of the apartment. Her alarm goes off, she climbs out of bed and I turn off the alarm, also a ritual. I get undressed and go back to sleep while she goes to shower. She comes back wet and climbs into bed and puts her arms around me. She is very warm although I feel cold from somewhere. Then she is gone and the bed is wet and cold but I stay and I am shivering. I notice someone else in the room. I don't know who it is but it is sexually exciting. Next thing I know I am awake and my friend/girlfriend is happy to see me and I am happy to see her. This still in the dream but I don't remember anymore.
