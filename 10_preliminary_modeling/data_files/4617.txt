["Chris Farley."] I am traveling down a side walk in my wheelchair. I see another woman in a weird manual chair. She's starting to cross the intersection and a bus is bearing down on her. I rush to push her across the intersection. She is upset with me because she wanted to go the other way. I smile at her good naturedly and say don't worry, I'll take you back. I push her wobbly chair back across the intersection. Then I continue on my way. I now have a flame thrower and am burning any trash laying around on the sidewalk. I see a young man who looks like Chris Farley. He watches me. He is interested in following me around. I go back the way I came to the office. I work at. I go in and file some papers. He watches intently.
