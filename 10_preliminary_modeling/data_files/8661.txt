I was at the home of someone I knew. Maybe BJ's. I was inside and there were a bunch of people outside. It seems that they're all in a car. in one car. There are ten or eleven people. I don't think it's a bedroom that I'm in but there is a full or double bed. There is stuff piled up everywhere. I can hardly walk. I'm thinking about where people are going to sleep. At first I'm not sure how many people there are. For some reason I think that this is going to be fine, that there's enough room for everyone. I'm thinking there's only two of us besides BJ. BJ comes in and we're talking about where people are going to sleep. She said something to me about everyone needing to sleep in that one room. I don't think there's any way that we can do that. I think that's when I realize there are ten or eleven people. I think there is one other person in the room now too. Maybe Bev. I'm just thinking there is no way we can all sleep in this one room. There's stuff everywhere so there's not even room on the floor. Then someone says something about Carter (from the TV program Trading Spaces) being one of the people. I said, Oh. Well. If Carter is one of them we can have three people in that one bed and he just has to sleep in the middle. I'm, of course, one of the people sleeping in the bed. We banter a little bit about that.
