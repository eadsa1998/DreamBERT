I was at dads on my computer. I had gone back to play Sims 3 but hadn't yet. I had been there for hours but hadn't bothered. I went to the lounge room and played the Wii. Then I was watching music videos. The first one they played was the one I wanted. I can't remember what it was but it was hard rock and the band's name was two words consisting of two letters each but was sometimes called 'TOC'. I was going to call Mom soon. I had the music down low so Dad didn't get annoyed.
