I was playing World of Warcraft. I was outside and this guy gave me this jumper which let me fly. I had to jump into the air and flap my arms. A group of us were doing it. Then I drove to some house and there was a lady there. I was with some friends and I think someone was sick. She gave us food etc. We went to leave and there was a maze outside and I couldn't maneuver out.
