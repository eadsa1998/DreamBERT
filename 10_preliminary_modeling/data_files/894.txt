I go diving in the deep river. It's 300 ft. Someone else and I must wear diving helmets and suits because it is so deep. Then, a huge shark attacks. There is blood swirling in the water. One of us is hurt. I'm not sure if I ran and the other is hurt or if it was me. Now, I'm on land. I'm leaving. I'm making gifts for people. I have a cake. I wrap it in cellophane. I then see a sack of candy bits and lollipops in bags in my desk drawer. I say, "Oh, too bad the cake is wrapped." I feel a little badly because the gift isn't much. Also, I don't want to just throw things away. Someone says, "You can unwrap it." They lift the cellophane. I put 4 different kinds of candy on the 4 sections of the cake. There is a second shark scene. Then, I'm auditioning or acting. Then, I'm in the C. department meeting. I watch. We are trying a new way. The women are being patronized and told to be quiet. It doesn't matter. I feel the need to speak. I ask Dylan permission in an adult way. "I have something to say. It might hurt some and might help me." He says, "Go ahead." Dickie glares at me. I say, "Part of me likes what's happening. Small groups are getting to know each other better, and are opening up and talking more honestly with each other (I vaguely remember that this is sort of what I had complained about earlier), however, there is still sexism here in the large group. Women are being told they don't matter." The group had nodded agreement during the 1st part, but Dickie is upset with me for the second part. I feel sad because I'm also making my farewells. I'm leaving them (to act, I think). I'm good for them and they won't listen. I go to pack (I'm in my wheelchair at the end).
