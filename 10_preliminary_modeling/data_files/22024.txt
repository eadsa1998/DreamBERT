I was alone in the house of my grandfather, sitting in the living room, looking at the shoes I had bought. I was complaining because they had made a mistake when they wrapped them up. They had wrapped the wrong model because I had tried on four different styles. I thought there must have been a confusion when they took them and that I would have to go back to Miraflores and spend the time and money. But anyway, I thought, I am going to have to go back to the store; they sure have lousy employees. It ends here.
