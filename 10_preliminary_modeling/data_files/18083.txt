We were taking a boat ride and there were crocodiles all over and we got on the boat. We floated over the ocean and then we got to our new house and we went down in the basement and it was scary and dark and we caught some mice. We went upstairs and I dropped some so I had to go back down and get them. Then we ran all the way up to the attic because we heard footsteps.
