One Sunday afternoon H., 20 yrs., my girlfriend, I., 23, her fiancee, a girlfriend who I cannot identify, B., 23, and I all went to a dance. These are all my friends. We went to a paladium that looked like the H. Theatre from the outside but had every earmark of H. H. at M. University. We all went in but we found everyone singing instead of dancing. Therefore we all sat down and began singing. My three girlfriends from M. University came in also. C., one of the girls was mad at me because I wouldn't exchange seats with her. A boy, I. was there and he was wearing a blue suit and new shoes.
