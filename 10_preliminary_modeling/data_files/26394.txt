 There is a keg party. My friend Niles Zelling is involved, and he may buy the kegs. Something happens with Mickey Mantle. Something happens with a woman fighter, and the Simpson's Oscar night. There is a keg of Rolling Rock beer and a keg of tequila. The keg of Rolling Rock costs $150. I seem to be in a town, and may be driving. It is dark.
