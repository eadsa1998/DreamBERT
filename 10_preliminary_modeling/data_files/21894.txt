I saw Table Twister and two other horses, but I can't recall them. I saw a sister nun on the street walking with another lady. I stopped my car by a crosswalk or street by a wall. I couldn't see if anyone was walking, but a crowd of people were coming out on two occasions and the same man came first both times and made off as if I bumped him. I expressed with my hands how far I was away from him and he grinned because he was kidding. I looked thru the window and I saw a brick some stack on a slant. I told the people to look, the smoke stack is falling down. We looked and it crashed to earth. I said, "Now it will shake the earth." We stood still and it shook the house. I looked at the sky and it was very dark in the west like a storm coming.
