I dreamt I was over to my sister's house. She said, "Wait til I show you the present I just got." She ran upstairs and came down with a large cosmetic case. In it were jars of different colored face powders, like one finds at a department store for mixing personally blended Charles of the Ritz face powder. They were violet, green, rose and several shades of peach and tan. I began to fuss around with the jars when my sister came back and placed some peach powder on a little glass lid in the center of the case. At that I offered to put it in the jar with the rest of the peach powder and did so. My sister looked at me, "What did you do that for?" She ran out and got a fork and came back and started picking pieces of potato out of the jar. "That wasn't powder I put there, that was potato salad," she told me.
