I dreamed I was sitting in a dark car when an unidentified man opened the car door and asked me my views on the Republican and Democratic parties. I can't remember what I told him. The next thing I remember is picking up a copy of the Reader's Digest and discovering a two-page article about myself. The first paragraph of the article said that in an interview with me, it was found that I had 2/10 Presbyterian blood, a Presbyterian father and was psychologically and culturally a Presbyterian. The article then went on to describe my character. I was very angry and disgusted because of the false statements the magazine had made about me and furthermore I couldn't understand where they had received their information because the unidentified man had only asked me my views on the Republican and Democratic parties. I gave the article to Dottie, a friend of mine, to read. As she read it, I complained about the inaccuracies and lies that magazines and newspapers printed and how you couldn't believe what you read.
