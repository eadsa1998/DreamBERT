I was down on the road I used to live on in Green City, at the bottom of the driveway where Cara used to live. Here there was a soft, marshy sort of area and in the middle of it, a tombstone. I forget what the exact words were on the thing but the gist was: some kid had run away from home and accidentally stepped into this marsh, which sucked him under and killed him. The tombstone had been placed there to warn all future runaways. I don't know how the tombstone stayed there. A whole bunch of other kids gathered and sat down around the tombstone and talked to me about it. Yeah, it's really sad, they agreed, but some kids really *need* to run away from home. Besides, there's not that many marshes out there.
