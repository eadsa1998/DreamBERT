["Chakotay protects me."] I am going to a conference. Maybe a counseling conference. I am trying to get in the building. Chakotay, smiling and friendly, comes up to help open the doors. Then as a joke, he gets in my wheelchair and I stand up on the back. I playfully tostle his hair. We are laughing and people are smiling at us as we go by. We go down a hall and find an area where books are being sold and food being served. The registration area is just beyond this. I see several women friends come over. I am surprised to see Bonnie there. I realize I should introduce Chakotay to my friends. One woman, perhaps like Julia B., overweight. Comes in front of us and sits on the ground. I introduce her. Then I try to talk with Bonnie and introduce her. I say, but where are you going to stay? She says I'll sleep in your van. I say, in Spanish, to impress Chakotay, that I didn't bring my communeta. I only have the carro. She says she will manage. Chakotay is concerned about her. He wants to help her. I belatedly realize she must be in trouble if she is here. He suggests she sneak into my room. I am a bit concerned about being caught and getting in trouble. But I agree.
