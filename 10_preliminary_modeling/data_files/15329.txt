I was in an apartment with some girl and we talked about black and white vs colour. The house was in black and white. She said movies in colour looked happier. She painted the floors yellow and bright. A guy came and was angry. We book stood up to him. Then he left and bad guys came. Alexander Skarsgard was there. I had coins in my pocket including some Swedish coins. He and the other guys came in. I tried to get past them and eventually managed to. I had to go down heaps of stairs and they chased me. I hid and then I was with someone else. They said 'assume that someone was looking for us there' so we went the other way but there were people in the bush. Wil Wheaton was one of them. Some other people saw us and we ran. We went into this building and there was a guy and girl with plastic suits on. Linus made a thread on FilmForum about all the movies he'd seen with stats. He'd seen The Big Chill 10 times.
