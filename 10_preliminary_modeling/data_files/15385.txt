I was at the old house with the characters from Friends. I only remember seeing Rachel, Chandler and Joey. Joey was trying to pick someone up. I was dating Chandler. He was sleeping in a sleeping bag on the floor of the lounge room with someone else. Rachel wanted to get pregnant and started to cry. I offered to do it and she said ok and we went to my bedroom and I started clearing the bed. She then said she couldn't and I said it was ok. We went back to the lounge and then we'd been up all night and it was early morning outside (like 5am). Chandler woke up and we kissed (just a peck) and he made a joke about how good the sex was on the couch (we hadn't done anything). There was a zombie movie with a group of people. At the end, someone put the infected into a microwave. A girl walked past and it exploded. She was ok, but some got into her mouth. The director/writer was a girl.
