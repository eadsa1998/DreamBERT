My dad was working at a gas station and my sister was flying a helicopter. Then all of a sudden I was a boy and my mom came along in a school bus because for some reason she was a teacher and she was going on a field trip with her class. My friend came out of the bus. Then some other weird stuff happened that I couldn't remember. Then I looked out over a big cliff and I saw some giant buffaloes. They were as big and bigger than if they were right next to me. Then I went over to see over the cliff and get a better look and they saw me. They started to run toward me and the ground started to shake and I fell down the cliff, way, way down. And then I always wake up at that part right before I fall into their mouths. I've had this dream about four times.
