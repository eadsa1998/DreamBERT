Today was my dream was real whacked out. I dreamt that I was riding along in this wheelchair like type thing and I was like scooting along down a path supposedly to get to Fort Washington Beach. And I would like to sit in this wheelchair and like scooch along and ooch along and get going at a pretty good speed, and we would be going down brick roads, around and through sand spur trails and through, and across the sand and through water and all kinds of different stuff. And we were nearing Fort Washington Beach and Mom had to lift me over this really big log, and she lifted me up with my chair and all and she put me down on this, the next block that had a great ____ in it. And there was this big electrical box next to it, and the vent was letting out hot air and I was like, "Aaahhh, aahhhhh, aahhhhh," because I was scared. And she was trying to explain something to me, but I didn't really hear her. She was just trying to kind of, I don't know. Then I dreamt that I was in our living room and we had a DVD player and we were trying to adjust the amplifier, and when we would change the sound field when the unit was on, there were like seven or eight -- it was at the top of the unit that would change the sound field -- and when we would change the sound field when the unit was on, it would cause this terrible, horrible grinding sound like you were shifting the gears in the car, or if you were trying to shift into park while it was still rolling -- that kind of a sound. And so whenever we did that, we had to turn the unit off, change the sound field, and then turn it back on again. And I don't remember exactly what, but something was screwy with the TV and the DVD player. They didn't want to cooperate, but I think we were getting there. And then I woke up. [laugh] And that's all she wrote.
