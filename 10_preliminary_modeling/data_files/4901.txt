["Haunted house."] I moved to a house and am trying to unpack. There are many rooms. I am upstairs. I go across the hall and into another room. It feels very scary. Some entity is in there. I go back out and down stairs. I try and calm down. I see the front door is blown open a few inches by a heavy wind and dry dead leaves are fluttering into the house. That makes me feel scared too. I shut the door and then see some round scatter rugs piled on a surface. I gather them up to clean up the place. Anastasia comes in. She is going to help me. She picks up some things and takes them upstairs. I find a few more rooms. Anastasia is gone for too long and I get worried. I go upstairs even though I am afraid. I can't find her. I pick up some more things laying around that makes the room appear messy. Now I am having trouble seeing. Like I can't keep or get my eyes open. I struggle. Then I can see and go to the scary room. I step in. It is bare. But I can feel the presence of the spirit. It feels threatening. I can't find Anastasia. Again, I can't get my eyes open and I feel panic. I struggle and manage to open them enough to get out of the room. Then I become aware of hearing the TV and realize I am hearing the Martha Stewart show with a Halloween theme. I know I am in that stage between waking and sleeping. I watch a few images shift and change. Then I wake up, still feeling uneasy and scared.
