I was sitting up in a tree with Dora, trying to figure out what my name was. We were thinking and thinking and we couldn't come up with anything. Dora said if we left soon we could see the monkeys pick bananas while they were still little. An elephant was bamming against the tree trunk. This steady rhythm was putting me to sleep. Dora said, "My mother says at least when the mean boys are down there doing gang whistles and throwing sticks we know we're not alone." If we were dying and we were alone nobody would know and it would be sadder. I was folding up a piece of paper and sticking it under my leotard. There were no drugs in it but I knew the way to fold it. It was about time to go to college. It was a long drive and we were running out of money. Dora said a couple of girls were looking ethereal, like angels, they thought because they'd lost too much weight and they couldn't think straight. First we had to drop off other people. I was last. I needed socks. When someone gave me $20 back I had $21.44 but the bill at the shoe store was $76.44 and I couldn't figure out why. I didn't even need any shoes. I needed socks. It was a shoe store. ??? had been given a choice in ???. The red plastic brown trash bag was filling and the chimney at all crazy angles like it'd been in a bad storm at sea. They asked Michael what he had to say about the house they'd given him and he said it doesn't believed it would be in the neighborhood. I also picked out 8 hairclips I didn't even like. They had stupid butterflies of them. They ran the bill up too high. I wanted some knee socks. Knee socks. I wanted white or black but they only had tan.
