Playing Call of Duty, a Search and Destroy match. I am the last one standing. I kill what should be the last enemy, bringing my team victory. But there is a glitch. More and more appear. I kill one, then another, and rush with the bomb to the pile under a tarp I am to destroy. I keep hitting the plant bomb button, which is resting on my crotch, and think, this is an awkward place to keep a detonator. I keep hitting the blue x button but nothing happens. Then an ally shows up. Then behind me an enemy puts a knife to my throat. I know it's over. I say, do me a favor, and shoot me in the head instead of that knife. She says, "Is this how you people do it?" or something like that. She put the gun to my head. I move it back a little to get everything -- I didn't want to inadvertently just cut my optic nerves. I say do it. She does it. I knew I would just respawn. I woke up in a boat being towed by bad guys. I was tied up. There were others with me. One man fell out and was being dragged in the water by the boat. We each had an individual rope attaching us to the boat. We were in a sort of dinghy. He fell in. I tried to help him. I fell in. It wasn't so bad.
