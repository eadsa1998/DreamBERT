I was walking down a street in an unknown city. It might have been San Francisco, but it was not that clear. I was dressed in some sort of a uniform. It was made up of blue pants and a red cap. The brightness of the red color bothered me. I was looking for my girlfriend, although I knew that I would not find her. As I walked along a woman Marine came along and took my arm. She seemed to be a stuffed dummy, because her arm felt like cloth stuffed with sawdust. I turned to ask her if she knew where I could find my girlfriend and found that she had disappeared. I then stopped at my car, but found in its place an old green Model T Ford which was crowded with a group of my fraternity brothers. They were going to a football game at a stadium which was very close to where the car was parked. I could not recognize any of them and took it for granted that they were my friends. They gave me two tickets to the game, and then they also disappeared. I was left alone holding the two tickets and wondering where I could find a girl to take to the game.
