I went to the movies to see some The O.C movie. The cinema was packed out and I was sitting next to Liesl. She had her feet over the arm rest and kept kicking me, so I moved over. The movie started and I realized it was going to be really boring, so I left. It was really late, so this guy had to unlock the door for me. I called Mom to get me.
