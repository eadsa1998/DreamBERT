Am in bed in a large room with light brown parquet floor. Room seems empty except for the bed. I turn on stomach and look down at floor, and see a large caterpillar crawling by and then a cockroach, plus some other odds and ends of bugs on the parquet. I reach under bed and grab a shoe. It is a woman's shoe and I use the sole to slap down and smash the bugs, one after the other. I turn to other side of bed and there are more. These I also kill. Then I find a pile of women's clothes, probably were under the bed. I get out and sort them on top of bed and note they are of large size, probably would fit me. One is a light blue skirt, size 18 on tag, and the blue wool material seems to have been cut short to make a mini skirt and done in a rough manner with a pair of scissors. While I examine the clothes and feel happy to have found some things I can use, the door springs open and 5 or 6 men come in. They shout for me to get ready; it is time to leave. They apparently are friends, but I hurriedly jump in bed and pull up the bedclothes, since I realize I am wearing a pink nightgown with a white lace collar and it would embarrass me to have them see me. They all leave except for one, and I tell him about the bugs which he sees smashed on the floor near my bed. Then I see a huge caterpillar on the door at end of room and shout for him to kill it. As he goes to door to do that, I use the opportunity to slip the gown over my head and stuff it under the bedclothes along with the other women's clothes I had found, thinking I will come back later for them.
