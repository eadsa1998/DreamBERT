I walked into a music classroom on the campus and found my professor from last quarter playing one of the musical instruments that he had taught me. I then walked over to him to see if there was a chance that I could be in his class for spring quarter because I had to drop another class and I needed the credits. He didn't answer me; he just continued to play the instrument while smiling at me.
