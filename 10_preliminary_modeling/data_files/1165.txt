A phrase, "The War's Over." I am a Queen. My hair is combed to look like roses. I see my bed in a field. War planes are taking off right over it. I think, "How sad." She/I can't sleep well this way. I see a stage now. A famous opera singer/dancer performs. Her face is cold, emotionless. A light is around her. She's seen even in a crowd. I'm now a princess. The Queen on my left and I walk down the stairs to the stage. It's a formal ceremony to honor the singer. I put my hand out to rest it on the Queen's arm and then I remember that rank-wise, it is for her to do. We reverse and she puts her hand on my arm. I think to myself as we walk slowly down the stairs, "The singer had better appreciate this." She doesn't. She is very haughty.
