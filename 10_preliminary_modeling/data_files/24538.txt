[having spent the afternoon with Erin. She hopes to leave the US for France soon.] I'm with Erin. We're in the country. It's our final time together. It's just understood. We care for each other very much. I go into a bar, looking for the owner. I walk towards a man who I mistake for him. We hold eye contact as I walk forward. He looks familiar-like someone from life. Both of us become aggressive. I need to bluff him and challenge him to a fight. We are almost fighting, grabbing each other. He has my throat. He is so confident. Another man, behind him, is watching. We agree to fight later. Erin waits outside and sees none of this. We meet friends. We spend time together. We go for a walk at night, very much in love. I'm waiting for the right moment to tell her about the fight. I know that the man watching and the man I mistook for the owner have it in for me. And I know that he is the better fighter. I have concern, not fear. Erin and I reach an old wooden porch. She wants to sit down. Thorny brambles cover the seat; still, it's possible to sit down. I tell her about the fight. I ask a favor. To call the police if the fight gets bad. Recollection ends here.
