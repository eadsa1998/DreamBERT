In my dream I was in bed aware of the fact that I was about to give birth to a baby. I fell into a deep sleep or when I woke the baby had been born. I had no pain and there was no evidence of afterbirth. At the time my parents were away and on returning both were overjoyed, especially my father (this is odd because actually my father hides his true feelings very well). I gave birth to a beautiful girl with long hair. She was very tiny, but very active. The happiness and love for my child and the baby's beauty was predominant in the dream. Then somehow my relations and I were together. I can't recall how we were united why or when. My uncle was predominant. He gave the baby some sort of a cradle or bassinet. This baby always attempted to get out of it. Everyone seemed surprised at my having a baby and I kept telling everyone I was married to Bob (Bob is the person with whom I have just broken up and whom I had planned to marry) although I had no ring. Then I remember a car but that's all. I didn't recall its significance.
