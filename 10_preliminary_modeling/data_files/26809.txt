 I'm at one end of a small rectangular room. There are people there. An argument is occurring. I'm nervous and uncomfortable about being here. There are physically strong and aggressive people involved in the conflict. I leave. I walk out of the room, picking up my ex-girlfriend Annie and carrying her out. We walk down a large hallway, like Scott Junior High, seemingly going west down the north hallway. I lift her up, and she sits on my shoulders. I have trouble balancing with her until she locks her feet behind my back. I walk down the hallway, crouching as we go below arches in the ceiling: low spots, so she doesn't hit her head. We near the end of the hallway and come to a large open room on our right. She tells me she thinks this is where she has to take a written test. I see many writing at desks, seemingly taking a test. People are waiting. I have a test to take as well: a different kind of test. It seems that Annie's test is more academically challenging. I think that this is appropriate because she is a keener scholar than I. Before I leave to go to my area, which is somewhere else, to test, she tells me that I had better call her, to stay in touch, or she'll track me down. She is serious. I feel good about myself because She cares about me, and I know I'll stay in touch with her. I don't know the room I'm testing in: I didn't make a point of remembering the room number. There's no time now to go back and look at the sheet that says the room numbers. <br/
