It's time to downsize the Goodwill factory I'm in charge of. I see the crew of sewers threading their needles. They each choose a piece of used clothing to repair. They stand in a line before a big rectangular clothing bin, then they take them to the resale clothing store. I am going to the front door to open it. I have the key. As usual, several people are waiting to get in first. I open the door and hang up the key and notice I need the key to open the cash register. I have trouble getting the key string off the corner hook and then decide to wear it on my left wrist, even though it will be heavy and cumbersome. I get the bottom drawer open and I see fake 50 cent pennies stuck together. An older woman brings her purchases to me and I calculate it on the calculator because I can't get the cash register to work. It comes to $3.00 and some cents. She puts a pile of coins on the counter and I start counting. It's not enough because she's also put rectangular saint liberty (sweet liberty?) dollars there and they don't count as real money. One is a faded stained glass. A young woman is waiting, holding her crying baby! I say, "Let me hold her." I put her carefully on my shoulder, on a burp rag and pat her! It feels wonderful to hold a sweet baby. She quiets down. She's a newborn.
