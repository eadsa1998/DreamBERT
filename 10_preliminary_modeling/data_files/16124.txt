I remember a little piece of a dream I had last night. I dreamt that, I keep having dreams about chorus and Mrs. Dougherty lately -- what is the deal with me? Anyway, I dreamt that I was going to make a -- hold on -- I dreamt that I was going to make a compilation CD with all of our songs on it, all of our accompaniment. And I was sitting down to make it, and it was like 9:30 at night, and I figured I'd better hurry just in case. And so I called what I thought was the, it was called the radio phone line for some reason, and it led into the Drama and Band Department. And Mr. Vaccaro answered, and I was really a befuddled buffoon as to what to say. I thought at least Mr. Hanover would answer. And then I woke up.
