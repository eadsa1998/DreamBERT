Mom took me to something and I decided I didn't want to go in. I waited in the car. This guy who looked like Ezra came over and opened the door and attacked Mom. He had a brick and was hitting her with it. I said at least he's not holding it down, or something, and then he did. He was really hurting her and I tried to get him off.
