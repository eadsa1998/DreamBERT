I saw Memory of Deamland in the paper as a winner. I looked at the paper and I saw St. Benedictine High football champs of 1952 and 4 years back basketball. Bob, Barbara and I were going to live in a cave for a while during the winter. We traveled thru snow and finally came to the cave and there was a puny woman there. I asked her how long she would stay, and she said, "Maybe till tonight if my husband shows up."
