I was in a place that was like World of Warcraft. Some others and I walked to a place called Fae to get to the flight trainer. I ended up with George Clooney and we were running away from someone? I think it may have been the police. At one point, I was on Princess Rd and I heard a cop siren behind us and I pulled into the carpark next to the sports centre and drove around. Then I was at a shop place. There were zombies or something. We went in. Each door had two people and we had to pick one and they were like 'magic'. For one of them, we chose "the Asian". One of the doors was called 'Night Watch'. We put some animal in a container full of carbon monoxide and took it in the car as we were on the run. George was in the driver's seat and was like 'why the hell are you bringing that?'. We left other people behind. Also, Leif joined the FilmForum Facebook group again. He posted on a conversation between him and I, and Linus called it a "bullshit convo".
