Four of us were starting off to catch a train. I discover I have left my suitcase behind and return to room for it. Find it OK in closet but R. has left much behind. I pick up machine or typewriter, one full or empty bag and try to get a long piece of tape but can't break it loose. Look over the banisters down three flights of stairs and see boys coming up. One has a knife and cuts the tape. I wind it up asking one of them to hold the bag so I can. One asks if I haven't something for him. Can't remember what I had promised. One offers to help me to station. I had wanted to go to toilet first but decided I could wait. Had thought of calling a taxi with so much to take. Wondered why R. had left so much. There were also old garments and an old briefcase, but better then mine, which I didn't take.
