I have a wealthy, large house and I'm walking through it noticing all the luxurious niceties. I go down a long flight of stairs and look out back. I see a camp structure, an overhang roof on ropes and love it. It is special, North American Indian and from the past. I prefer to spend my time there than in the house. I call Howard' s attention to it. Later, I am the boss woman in the strawberry fields, overseeing my workers. I go back through the house, now noticing it looks ill kept and ordinary on the outside and glad of it because no one will rob it then. I notice the back porch and that special camp place are really nice looking and I can't wait to get there.
