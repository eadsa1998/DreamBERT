A woman is creating a dream software package. She's ahead of my work, I am thinking. She has published her own hard cover book. I am jealous. I read it, and am relieved to see that there isn't anything of substance, just pretty flower pictures. I read a critical negative sentence about Ricardo and how he didn't really do a good job. I am distainful of her. I know he created lots of good stuff.
