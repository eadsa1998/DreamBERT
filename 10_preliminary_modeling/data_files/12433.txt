I was at school. We were given these rings that we had to keep with us at all times. We were making these boxes to keep them in to hang around our necks. We were in my English classroom. Mine went missing. Adele was there. Evelyn was sitting next to me. I went back to my desk as Dmitri was going to put something in his black file in this cupboard behind me. But because I was in the way, he gave the stuff to me to put away. I started reading through his file thing, and I was going to take some of his stuff, but Evelyn was watching me. There was a book where he had done those gay games with Calvin and there was something about "Swamp Boy". His interests (supposedly last 'searched' items) were piercings, eyebrows and I forgot the rest, there were lots though. I only remembered the bad things. I was terribly upset about this and decided I couldn't like him anymore. At lunchtime Ezra and his friends were annoying us. Calvin and I were throwing sticks at them. I think Elijah was there too.
