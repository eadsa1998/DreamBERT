Three ladies are in my room fixing it up. They keep interfering with my belongings and I, near tears, keep wishing they'd go. I want to dress and tell them they shouldn't come before breakfast. I look for glue to mend something. Finally find it on shelf in toilet. Poured out too much and it spills but it is rather thick and I pick up the yellow semi liquid in strings. Then I pick up a book, The life of Dickens, which I had forgotten to return to the library. I hunt for the card to find out when it was due but can't find date and am worrying if I'll have to pay more than the book is worth when I realize I'm dreaming and have no such book.
