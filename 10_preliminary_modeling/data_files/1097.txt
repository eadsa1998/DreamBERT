A large, fat woman is a guest speaker for the C. dept. In the middle of her speech, she looks sad and concerned and scared and starts crying. She is unable to go on. I talk to her and console her. I say, "Don't worry, I don't like half the people here and I work here with them." I tell her it's O.K. to do what she did. No one will despise her for it. She turns black and her face gets contorted. I'm a little amazed. I pat her on the hand and continue to console her.
