 I'm in the Brimson Library near the desk where students check out items that are on reserve. I'm working on a computer there. It seems to not be working correctly. Hal Billings, the soccer coach, starts to set up a computer in the reading room on the first floor on the north side of the library. He sets up a computer monitor. I go to the same room and set up my own computer and get it running. I hear a voice behind me talking to me. I turn and see it's my classmate Rachel Steiner. She talks to me, asking me questions about the night we spent together, and about her. I don't want to talk to her, to see her, or be around her. I want her to leave me alone. She grills me with questions. I don't respond to most of the questions. I don't want to tell her outright that I think she's fat and ugly and she disgusts me. On the computer I seem to be using email and also seeing a weather forecast.
