I am in the back seat of a car. My brother Jake is with me. My father is driving. I am looking out the right side window (like a child might) and I see a dropoff. It's pretty, with snow, but a steep dropoff. I look to my father. I see we're on a gravel/dirt road. I tell him he's driving too close to the edge. It's dangerous. He laughs and deliberately jerks the wheel so we are even closer. I am annoyed. We drive through town. It does not look familiar, but yet it is my town. We are going to a nursing home to visit "Aunt Marya." When we get there, I realize we're at an ice rink. I say, "Hey, I thought we were going to a nursing home to see Aunt Marya." She walks by, a very old woman, and I feel embarrassed she heard me because she obviously doesn't need a nursing home. I've insulted her. Someone says, "Let's play ice hockey." "Right!" I say. "So is the ice rink wheelchair accessible?" I was sarcastic. Now I see Aunt Millie and Lydia. I am very excited and happy to see Aunt Millie. We all now have on ice skates. Aunt Millie is on my left and Lydia on my right, supporting me as I fumble and slip. We get on the ice, but the ice is really crowded with people and cafe tables and chairs. There are rectangular cuts of ice where the ice is chips and there is water under it. I must avoid all these obstacles. In addition, at the far right end is a heated swimming pool, and it's hard to avoid sliding right into it. But I manage and now I'm skating alone and Millie and Lydia are seated watching me as I come around. They smile and applaud. I feel quite accomplished now and gather up speed. More rectangular cuts are made and the ice is incredibly chopped up, and yet I continue to skate well.
