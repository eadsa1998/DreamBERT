I dreamt of driving to my maternal Grandma Jane's house.  Once there, though, my (deceased) maternal Grandpa Gerald showed up.  He had greenish red lesions on his neck and shoulder that was supposed to be glaucoma; I think it was actually cancer.  In any case, it was good to see him again, although I didn't get to give him one of those long hugs like I used to always do in dreams.    I remember wondering.  It was a collective dream, having him there.  Grandma Jane dreamt it, but the rest of us could see him too.
