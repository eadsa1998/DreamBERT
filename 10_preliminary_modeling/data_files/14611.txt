I was dating this Indonesian (or so I think) guy, and I was pregnant but I had cheated on him with this other Asian guy [note: watched paternity tests on Maury Povich last night]. Sometimes I was Ezra and he said he didn't want his kid around the Indonesian's sister, who was younger and was like 4 years old. Then I was meeting his parents? But then, I was with another lot of parents and I introduced the other guy I was with as my boyfriend, who was called Rupesh [note: watched Torchwood the other day]. Then I was somewhere else and I was actually going out with Eugene. We were at a shop looking at fans and he was getting one similar to one that I had, though I was thinking it was pointless since we were always in the same bed. There were chairs there. I was watching him at one point and I was thinking like, that I was lucky and he was hot. I went to touch him and then pulled my hand away. Then I was at some other place and everyone had found out that I'd been sleeping with the other guys. Eugene was upset and went to this other room. I was upset about Eugene and fell into a heap, then the second Asian guy, who was now Felipe from chemistry, got this ring and was trying to propose to me and I cried and told him to go away and hit him with this tray. Later, I was playing World of Warcraft and killing these red spiders and usually there were birds there, but they weren't now because it was a different season. Eugene sent me a message over the game asking me what I was doing, then sent back saying oops, he forgot (that he was angry at me, I guessed).
