In the first place I dreamt that I was in my house (Trujillo), getting out of a car, when an unknown boy passed by and grabbed me by the arm. I shouted bloody murder at him, but later I realized that it was my cousin. But I also shouted at him and told him he had no right to grab me. A tremendous scene took place and he and his parents and brothers, who were home, left angry.
