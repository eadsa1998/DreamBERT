 I arrive at my dad and Lisa's house, which is a white house with a garage, not a townhouse. My mom has driven me here. I have a canoe with me that is filled with gear for camping, paddling, and fishing. My friend Niles Zelling is at the house. The canoe is aluminum, and is in the garage. My dad and Lisa come out. I ask them if I can clean up all the stuff from the canoe trip tomorrow: it's a mess. They say that's okay.
