I must hide. Arranging books, 22 or 23 of them. My fat green volumes of Scott are out of order. ...We come out and I look for mother and J. lost in crowd. ... He said to J, "I understand what you mean, not to have to wait to be served until food is cold." Nevertheless we go to the same old restaurant. ... I'm with H. and her husband at their hotel. We divide the Sunday paper. I look for "What to Do Today" but the column has little information. Where are the funnies? We return to room but my section of paper is missing. ... I say I must start back but they urge me to spend the night but I didn't tell the K. D. Home. So we go to get the bus schedules. I start across the road but the gravel hurts my bare feet. Now I'll get in trouble because I didn't tell the Home.
