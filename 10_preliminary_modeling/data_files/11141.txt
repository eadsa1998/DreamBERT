I dreamed that I was with a bunch of girls from BW. We were all on the Medina High School stage and groups of us were putting on little skits and trying to beat the other group. My group put on the best one--sang and talked some. After my act I went down into the audience and sat down. Just as I was about to sit down, I saw one of my old boyfriends and I was startled and woke up.
