 I get a phone message to call my high school friend Sam Kingsley. There is also a note about my new driver's license number, with a 967 or 917 in the number. Sam is with his old girlfriend Janelle West. They go by. I poke my elbow into Sam, and tell him we're going to Riverton for a basketball game at 5:30. My high school teammate Tony Kramer says we'll be leaving at closer to 4:15. I'm sitting around a table that is crowded with my high school basketball team. My friend Nate Nelling is wearing a sweater and a dress coat. It's like a reunion. I'm in a gymnasium shooting baskets with Sam and a woman. I am rusty and very stiff, my knees especially. The woman says I have good backspin on my shot. It's then pre-game high school basketball, Armstrong versus Riverton. I'm playing with my team from Armstrong. I war my old red, white, and black Nike shoes from my junior year. A rival player, Dan Dubbin, is playing for Riverton. He is tough. It is reminiscent of our glory days in high school. I sit down in a gymnasium-like locker room. I get dressed. I'm shirtless. I tie my shoes and loosen up, flexing my muscles. I slap hands with my teammate Binky Ahmed and others before the game. Binky has spilled something in his pocket. The place he spilled is where a pregnant woman's water has broken as well. The woman with whom I was shooting buckets says its' no good to tighten the second knot on a double knot. My sister Ramona, her friends, including Muriah Ahmed, my high school teammate Carl Everson, and others are there for the game. It is glory days relived.
