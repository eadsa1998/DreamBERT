Father Andrew and Fr. George (older Ass't priest) are at our house for a BIBLE STUDY. Much discussion and then as Father Andrew is about to leave, I walk over to my "icon shelf" and take out my FATHER's PHOTO in a plastic stand, but there are other photos stuck in with it. Finally I show Father Andrew my father's photo as he sits in his office in Ulenna and talk about my warm feelings for my father. Father Andrew is very friendly and not at all judgmental as he passes my messy drawers: "Yes, it is as bad as I've seen it" but he implies I can do something about it.
