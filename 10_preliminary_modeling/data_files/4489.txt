["Counseling a counselor."] I am working as a counselor with a woman who is a counselor. I am reading her test results. She is very nervous and I encourage her to listen to the results. They will help her. I see a blues harp glued to the page I am reading. I see hers is an "E" harp and mine is an "a" harp. I suggest we can have fun harmonizing with each other. A man, like Tim Allen, sits beside us, playing a guitar and a blues harp. The music is bluesy and fun.
