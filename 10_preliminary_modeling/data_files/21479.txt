Loddie and I were looking over some chasers to grind to make a thread for a missile part. I held one missile up and had another beside me. The moon seemed to be so close, it seemed the other missile would touch it. The USA seemed to have a missile that would put people on the moon. I looked up at the moon and it seemed to be only about 15 ft. high or above me. We landed on some barren land. It seemed like another planet. We got company because there seemed to be other countries that came there also. I watched a lady and man work some new invention of the USA, a sort of typing apparatus.
