Julie Skinner and I were talking indoors.  I was still very much attracted to her.  She was sitting in an easy chair with her legs tucked under her and telling some anecdote about her third grade teacher who, she said, was really crazy.  I had a feeling of déjà vu about this anecdote, or about her description of her third grade teacher in general.
