["Big bug invasion."] A good looking man and I are attracted to each other. I am wearing a bright yellow dress with a skirt that flows and swirls. I prance around with joy and enthusiasm. We are in a cow pasture. The man has a cow. And I look at it startled because it can't seem to stand up right. It must be sick. The man and I approach it to help. It falls over and huge beetle like bugs come out of it's mouth. They might be infectious so I prance around and keep them corralled with my feet so they can be examined. Later I am twirling and dancing around the man.
