[Note: After I was robbed, I had this dream for the next three nights.] I'm walking home from Ashmont Station. I see someone standing around on a side street. I cross the street because I feel something is wrong. There isn't anyone else on the sidewalks tonight. There aren't even any cars going by tonight. the man crosses the street and follows me. My heart is beating fast. I increase my pace since I'm near my street. He's also walking faster. My mind's racing because I don't know what to do. I turn around to see how close he is to me. I see a black, tall man wearing all black -- he pulls out a knife and says, "Give me your bag." I start running and screaming, "Help me; somebody help me." Then I wake up and can't fall asleep again.
