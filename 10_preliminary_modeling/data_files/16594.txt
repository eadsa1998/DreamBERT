Mom and Aunt Christine were in our kitchen here at home, and Mom was putting a CD in her little, cheap little CD player thing on the kitchen counter area by the microwave. And Aunt Christine was telling Mom that Allen Toussaint was in a nursing home and some criminal had come in there and chopped off his head. And for whatever reason the people let the body sit there for a year in the nursing home. And whoever it was came back a year later to chop off his hand. And I don't remember what happened with all of that, but I remember seeing this little TV show about the whole ordeal and the criminal was prosecuted. And some -- I think Bruce Springsteen or some band put together this tribute CD for him. They got all kinds of singers and all kinds of people and performers to get together and perform his songs, and they were playing this CD in the kitchen. And this dream Allen Toussaint and Professor Longhair were the same person. [laugh] And so this was the great loss of that persona. I'm trying to think now, I know there was a whole ordeal going on before this. I think it was when Aunt Christine was telling Mom about everybody and their brother who had been murdered last week. That's weird. [laugh] Oh, and I also remember some of us being in the living room and asking Dad about how cops aim when they're going to shoot somebody. I don't know why I was dreaming all this; it's just sort of funny. But let's see, Allen Toussaint covered S________ and I heard that on 89.7 last week. And I went to sleep with a sore wrist, and the neighbor, Cassandra's best friend, Corinne's daughter, Eddie hurt, I mean, Eddie hurt his hand a couple of days ago and it seemed like it was going to be really bad, but it wasn't. And that's all I can think. I don't know what I was thinking.
