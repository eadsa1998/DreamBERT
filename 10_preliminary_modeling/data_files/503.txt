I am in an old house with an open basement and lots of open beams. My youngest daughter falls through but got herself out before the firemen arrive. She looks sick but doesn't appear to be hurt. Just before this happened a young man came to the house. He was wearing bright blue sunglasses. I had been riding with a friend, her two sons and my son in the friend's truck. I wanted to make coffee but the pot wouldn't work and her oldest son didn't want it for some reason. I learned that her youngest son had AIDS. The old house had lots of roots under it and there was a long ways for it to fall (into the hole).
