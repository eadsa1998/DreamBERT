I was taking care of a little boy. His mother is a good friend of our family. They lived next door in a duplex and the lady next door was having a party for her little girl. When the children came, I played with them, especially one little boy. When I went in, this little boy followed me. He said he was tired, so I put him to bed in my bed. A while later I went to look at him and he had wet his pants. I discovered that he was wearing diapers and I wanted to change them, but I couldn't find any clean ones. I asked Woody (the child I was taking care of) where his old ones might be. He didn't know, so I went and asked the lady who was giving the party. She said that she wondered where he was. I asked who he was and how old he was. She said that he was 10 years old, but he had a very poor home life. His mother hadn't wanted him so she never trained him or loved him at all. She told me then that his name was Freddy.
