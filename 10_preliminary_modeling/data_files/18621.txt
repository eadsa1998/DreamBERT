I was waiting with Dora. We were traveling together and Dora wanted to send her friend (a stranger) a thank you note. There were several pens around but Dora was looking for a pencil. I was getting impatient but Dora wandering around semi- clothed, or unclothed and I'm looking for a girl named Dianne, to thank her. I was holding a ginger ale in each hand, one for me, one for Dora. There was a concrete slab. It hovered about 12" ground even though it was heavy. It had a handle and there were 2 other variables that steered and 3 variables that also chose direction. One was sex (male or female). I was sitting on the concrete slab. It was big. They were so excited when Rudy was there, to go to church, but he didn't want to go, so it disappointed everyone. And Elizabeth (my cousin who died) could be very forceful when that could be useful. There was an empty apartment but it was in Columbia and quite a long commute.
