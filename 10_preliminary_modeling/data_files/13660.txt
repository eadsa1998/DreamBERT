I was at school and I was in physics. The class was different. It was almost home time and Mr Reilly gave me and someone else some extra work to do. I had my iPod on, but it was in my bag. It wasn't loud, but I could hear it properly. I wanted to take a photo of Eugene. He leant over Josephine. Someone came in who had been missing most of the lesson. She said she'd seen an owl and it kept copying what she said and she freaked out and ran a mile and her friend had to go after her. I was then somewhere else in the school. Calvin was there and he pretended there was an emergency (a strike) so we could get our leavers jackets early. In 15 minutes they were all there in wheelbarrows. Ms Olmstead was there and I asked if I could hand them out.
