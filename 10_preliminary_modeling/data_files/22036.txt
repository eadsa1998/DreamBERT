I and a group of boys with whom I graduated from high school had gone on a trip to the North. Going through one of the towns, we stayed at the house of G. Buse, a geography professor at the university. Charles, Rodney, Stanley, Ramon and Rene were at his house. We were happy and having a good time as it usually happens on the first night of a camping trip. And in spite of that, the professor continued calmly reading his newspaper without paying attention to us. There was a fight between Ramon and Stanley. Ramon came out running and Stanley was chasing him. He caught up with him, threw him on the floor, and hit him with a piece of clay, but nothing happened to him.
