There were these people coming over and we were at this friend's house up in Largo, I guess, I had the notion. And I was walking around upstairs in these people's house, and walking back and forth on this point. There were some Christmas decorations, display figures, up there, and I was talking to, oh no, I was looking down at all the people coming in and I thought I would go down and say hi, so I did. And the next thing I knew, we were in a boat, or we were getting ready to go on a boat with some of the people, and the engine wouldn't start and I was sitting there on the boat with a boombox. The engine wouldn't start and there was this certain tour boat starter thing that made a lot of noise that would start the engine, but first I wanted to get off the boat and go walk around on this little island in the main group while they were doing that. And so I got Mom to take care of the boombox, and I got up and I guess at that moment I woke up.
