[I was working on my repeat study of bilingualism in preschool children and we were having difficulty in keeping Filipino and Japanese speaking recorders for the project.] I am distressed because my Filipino recorder is quitting. Go to find her and tell her of the fix I'm in. Three Japanese helpers have quit.
