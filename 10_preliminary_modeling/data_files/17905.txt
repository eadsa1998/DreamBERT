My boyfriend Jeremy was writing a book or a script.  He pitched or read it to me and a few other people.  I don't remember the plot.  The ending was not happy- it would be too stereotypical if it was a happy ending.  It was not impressive as a whole- turned down.  I thought it was okay but was confused about the third quarter of the story- he sort of rushed through that.<p
