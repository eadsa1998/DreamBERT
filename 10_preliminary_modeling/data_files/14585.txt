I was in the lounge watching TV. Mom and Darren were talking and then started looking for something. I asked what they were looking for and they said a spider. Darren said to keep our hands on our throats as they were poisonous. I looked for a bit and then went back to my room. My left leg was a bit numb. I went to my computer and was playing a new song I'd found. It was then Homeward Bound and then Electricity.
