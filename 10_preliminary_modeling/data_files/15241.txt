I was at a party, which I think was at my place. My boyfriend was Josh Radnor and we kept sneaking off to have sex. He kept slipping into a dream and I told him to do a reality check if something was weird. In one of his dreams, he was in a room with me and I took orange juice out of the fridge and started drinking it. I disappeared and he couldn't read the words on the juice box, so he did a reality check. When he woke up he asked me about lucid dreaming. Someone warned him that he could get addicted. They used me as an example and I said I did it as a hobby and I wasn't even good at it. Someone said about Christopher Nolan, "spending 3 years to make a movie". There was a tape of me when I was 2-4 with a psychologist. I hadn't seen it before.
