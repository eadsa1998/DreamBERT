Lucy is looking for some stairs. I give her verbal directions. She's on her hands and knees and isn't very good at following my directions. I am annoyed. I tell her she's in front of some plants. She knocks them over. Then she breaks the first step. I am not going up the steps, but they turn into a machine that will catch my hands and fingers if I'm not careful. My fingers get caught and I think I'm dreaming. I can change this. I think about getting my hands out and I succeed!
