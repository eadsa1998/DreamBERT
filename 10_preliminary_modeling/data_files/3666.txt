I am in a crowd of people. We are teens or young adults at a movie. Some man says to me as we are leaving, "You didn't behave well this time. You left early and attracted attention." Later me and my friends come back to ride in hot air balloons. It's a contest of some kind. I am in mine and I hold a goose close to my chubby belly. It lays an egg. We go up and float around. It's fun.
