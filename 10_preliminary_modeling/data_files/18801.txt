I dreamed I was at a bus station getting ready to catch a bus. I had my ticket ready and when the bus pulled up, the driver parked next to a newer bus. The door of the bus remained closed and I started banging on it with my hand for him to open. When he opened the door, he told me I was to take the newer bus. I then was standing around when the driver started talking to me and he recognized my face, but couldn't remember my name. (He then was one of my junior high school teachers.)
