At Marissa Camden's, getting reading to go to Prayer Group, I forget my coat. -- Father Andrew is working in S. City in the Education Dept; I come up and see Ruth and Edward S. standing there, waiting: I greet them, then Father comes in and smiles; I say: "Father I know the _____" (can't remember their names). He begins to work in his cubicle and I think what a come-down from his Church office; there is much telephoning; I walk up to him and ask him when he is going to the prayer group: he says: "I am sorry but I can't go today; too much work." He looks tired, and he holds his ear, "too much telephoning -- it buzzes in my ear." "I know," I say, "I did a lot of phoning the other day too." How silly of me.... I should have called you sooner; now it is almost too late to go. "You can still make it; I will call a taxi." He calls yellow cab, it arrives downstairs near a restaurant; but again I have forgotten my coat. Suddenly there is Zena: wants to eat chicken soup: I ask taxi to wait. Look up Pauline Peters' address in phone book (where Prayer group is really meeting). I take too long in looking up the number and taxi leaves. I am undecided. Finally walk home with Zena; we are met by a parade of people on crutches. See Miss Crandall in front row. We get home and I "wake up" from my dream and it's "too late" to go to prayer group.
