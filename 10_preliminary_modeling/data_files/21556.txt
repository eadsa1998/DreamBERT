I was coaxed into a duel to fight someone I didn't even meet for Bob or some of his friends. I walked over to Peter Drendas's place and was to meet the big bully I was to have it out with. As I walked bravely, I was thinking this was a challenge. When I got there, I met a fellow. He said, "Follow me," so I walked into the country and woods. I thought I was walking into an ambush. We stopped in a spot near a stream eventually and I was on my guard. He said, "I would punch your partner and then hit you one and it would be over." I said, "Don't fool yourself. When you would be hitting my partner, I would be on guard as I always am." This surprised him, so he said, "Let me show you how you would go about it," so I shadow boxed in front of him and he was convinced that I was pretty good. So he backed out of the fight. I heard Georgie.
