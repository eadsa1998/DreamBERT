This dream is very vague in my mind. As I remember it, the dream had some connection with being in a room (I think there were others in the room) and a very good friend of mine (f, 20) who was recently married entered the room. As I looked at her I immediately noticed that she was pregnant. I was very happy to see her, but I could hardly recognize her. As I approached her and looked at her, it was not really the original girl who I thought I recognized, but another friend of mine (f, 20) who was just recently married. I remember we greeted, and then entered an empty room where we sat on the floor and talked. I do not remember the contents of the conversation. I think we discussed the young lady friend of mine whom I recently broke up with.
