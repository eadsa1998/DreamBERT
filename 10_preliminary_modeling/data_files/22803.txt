This dream has a Gone With the Wind type atmosphere, although I can only put my finger on a couple of factors which might bring about this association.  The strange part about this dream is that it seems to occur twice.  Daddy and some other man are running down the midway of the Bayview Beach amusement park.  I inquire around and find out that they have taken a rusty old piece of metal that they call a gun and the army is looking for them and will shoot them on sight.  Suddenly everything becomes a small town-kind of resembling my hometown but with very narrow streets about 15 feet wide.  It is Sunday, and church and Sunday School are just beginning all over town.  As I run, crying every once in a while, some nice person asks me if I am going to Sunday School.  I wind through the streets and finally come to a lot of doors like in a crowded section of the French Quarter.  One door says "Rhett Butler."  I go in it.  Daddy is there, in the first door to the left.  I tell him to give me the gun.  All it is is a round piece of rusty metal.  He gives it to me.  I step out of the door and hurl it toward the oncoming group of men, thinking they will take it and leave us alone.  But they keep coming.  I come back just inside the door, and when the first person opens it I lunge at him and grapple with him.
