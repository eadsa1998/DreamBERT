I have a date with a girl. She is the ticket taker at a movie house and I have admired her frequently (in reality). Now we are at a picnic place by the sea. She feels a bit out of place. We are in a Jewish crowd and she is the only Christian girl there. Besides everyone thinks she is a whore which I am both suspicious and hopeful of. I notice that she is ill at ease and we walk away and go to a platform from which we watch the sea. I have clasped her hand and I am overcome with tenderness for her. (I think she is wearing her usher's uniform. During the dream I noticed that she was flat-breasted.) We admire with poetic sensitivity, the sea. I ask her whether I might kiss her. She said she did not mind but told me she was incapable of passion. I did not mind too much.
