I was taking a bath with Rob, Rob's girlfriend, and me.  First Rob got in the bathtub on the bottom, then Heidi was in the middle, and I got on top.  Each of us were on our backs on top of the other one.  It was sensual but not sexual at all.  It was more playful.  There was a bit of talk about crushing each other, but we didn't worry about it, no one was uncomfortable.  I remember pulling up the lower half of my body to see a full view of my body out of the water, breasts to waist to hips.  Like I was almost positioned upside down, maybe I put my feet way up on the wall. Heidi was done first, she got out, and went into another room.  I was glad about this because then I got the bath all to Rob and myself.  We bathed more, now sitting up some.  We pointed out how much dirt came off in the bath, there were circular swirls of dirt floating in the water from our bath.
