["Saving the man with love."] Clark Gable is very good looking and very drunk. He is an unhappy man. I am a beautiful young woman seated at a table in the restaurant next to him. He has a male friend who helps him. We are watching some movie, maybe a WWII movie. Clark sees me and falls deeply in love. He stares at me continuously. I try to concentrate on the movie. I can feel his deep need and love. I am attracted to him as well, but I sit waiting. The other man comes over to my table and talks with me. He is watching our courtship intently. The black maid he is in love with comes in. She sits at our table. He is now intently watching her. Clark says something, a joke to attract my attention. I walk over to him and put my arms on his shoulders standing very close to him as we joke back and forth talking nothings while the body contact and wistfullness is acted out as we become physically closer and closer. Now the black maid rebuffs the friend. He is devastated. I tell Clark that his friend needs him. Clark is desperately trying to pull out of his drunken state and behave well. He can barely notice his friend's plight because of his own struggles and high concentration on his love for me. I am sympathetic to the man and to Clark.
