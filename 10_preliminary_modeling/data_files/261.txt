I live in an apartment building - kind of one, I'm not real sure what it is - very open, has an open walkway with a railing, in front of the door that I've come in and out of. I'm not sure if I live alone or with some other people, but there's others around, they're all my age - once again I'm younger (or seem to be younger) than I am - I'm thinking of all these people in their twenties, a lot of camaraderie, lot of "youthful" palling-around is going on around here. I'm waiting for an old friend to come visit me - it's your typical week (or weekend) visit, and I'm getting ready for that. There has been a big mess made outside somewhere, for some reason. It involves tape - stuck to the railings of this outside bridgework, and it's the "guys" who have put it there - I go along and take it off, kind of when they're not looking. They were going to do it anyway, but I decided I'd just go ahead and do it. Then my friend arrives. Turns out she's a girl, and I do not know her in waking life - she's nobody in particular - and I also don't feel very close to her. Like I say, she's an old friend, I haven't seen her in a long time. This is not your warmest possible greeting. We're just curious to see how things are gonna go. I introduce her around.
