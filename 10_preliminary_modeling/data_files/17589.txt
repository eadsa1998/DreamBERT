I dreamt about not being able to get to class on time. I sat in on a different class, somehow, but I didn't make it to Spanish either, or philosophy the next day.  It was like I was trying to get there from my parents' place.  I started to run to find a city bus, and there was a group of people waiting for the bus, but by the time I got there, it was too late.
