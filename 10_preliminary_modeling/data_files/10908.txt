I dreamed that I went into the Commodore Bar alone and ordered a glass of port and Seven Up from a waitress, but was feeling a little guilty about being in a bar all by myself at night. The order was brought in a cup with the Seven Up, and the port in the bottle, only it wasn't port. It was whiskey or something. The bottle was horizontally laid on the table, and I knew I shouldn't pick it up. Somehow the drink was spilled in the cup and I put a napkin in a saucer to soak it up. I drank it and expected my head to become dizzy, but nothing happened. On the way out, I saw two girls who I know who were drinking some beer, but whether I stayed with them I don't know.
