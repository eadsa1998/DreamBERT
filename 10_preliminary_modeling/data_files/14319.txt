I was at school, which was different, for graduation. I saw some people wearing light pink gowns and I was told where to go to get mine. Elijah and I were complaining that they were pink. I saw Eugene there. The group of people I was with and I had white gowns though. Only a few were pink. I went to this place to get picked up. Seamus and Milo Ventimiglia were there. Milo asked what I was doing for the year and I said "I don't know, thought I'd leave it to the last minute". He asked if I did accounting last year and how I went and I said "not very good". I had my headphones from my iPod in my ears all this time and my ears were starting to hurt so I took them out. My ears still hurt and I couldn't hear properly out of my left ear. I checked the time on my phone and Milo leaned to look too. It was 4.14pm. I was thinking I'd go on IMDb and say 'Milo Ventimiglia went to my school'. I wondered why I hadn't made a fuss of it before. Mom and I went to Santiago's. We waited in the car and he handed me this sheet of paper with a list of songs on it and he wanted me to burn him a CD [burnt a CD for someone last night]. Grace Kelly was the first song on the list and he had "Cold Pouring Rain -- Dragon" and I figured he meant 'Rain'. Only some stations on the radio worked where we were, but they were all playing the same song. Next time we went there I gave the CD to Mom, who gave it to Santiago. He was talking loudly and fast. Some girl gave us these books with things to do for exercise but as they were expensive we just took one. It was just places to go which would require a lot of walking around and it was all stuff in the US or Europe; there were lots of pyramid places, giant mazes and museums.
