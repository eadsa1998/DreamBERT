Me and two of my friends were playing tag in a forest at my school. It was hide and go seek tag. (There were some other kids playing tag that I did not know.) Me and my friend were hiding together by a bridge that went over a small stream. My other friend found us which meant we had to run back to base. Me and my friend who was not it ran and jumped over the stream. I tripped and started falling falling fallingthrough the ground. Setting: In a forest, by a small stream at my school. Characters: Helen and Arlie. There were some other kids playing tag that I did not know. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, scared. I was happy before I tripped because the game was fun, but I was scared when I tripped because I didn't know what would happen to me.
