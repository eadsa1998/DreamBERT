I had gone to spend the night, or I think more than one night, somewhere with a female friend and her young daughter. There were other people there that we knew. I was in bed one night and a man that I knew came in to the room and sat on the edge of my bed, facing me, and began to fondle my breasts. I told him to stop but he didn't want to. I told him again to stop and he became very angry. I was sure if I yelled at him loud enough someone would hear me and he would stop but when I tried to yell I couldn't. Now he appeared to be kneeling on the floor next to bed, facing me. He raised his right arm way out and up so his hand was at the same height of his head. He threatened to hit me if I didn't cooperate. I was trying to decide if I should go ahead and scream or just cooperate so he wouldn't hurt me. This seemed to happen twice, though he never did hit me. Now I'm telling my friend that I want to leave, even though it is in the middle of the night. I didn't tell her why but it was because I was trying to avoid anything sexual happening with this man and trying to avoid him hurting me. I knew that meant we would have to wake her young daughter in the middle of the night. I wasn't sure she would go agree to go without an explanation. I was going through things in my head. I could just go without them. I would be driving during the middle of the night - not an ideal thing for me alone or with someone. I could carry her daughter to the car and she could continue to sleep in the backseat while we drive. Whether I went alone or with them I was still sure it was the right thing to do, to go home now to avoid anything happening with this man.
