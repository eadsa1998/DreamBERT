We had a group meeting but somehow we all forgot [have a group meeting today]. We accidentally bumped into each other at university (which was different) and we were like 'oh feck, the meeting', but then we were like 'let's do it tomorrow'. I distinctly remember Classmate-M-02, Classmate-M-05 and Classmate-F-13 (she asked me something). Classmate-M-05 was talking to me about something. We were outside near a car. Then later I was inside somewhere for work. I needed to get changed, so I went up an escalator to find the toilet. I went to go to the toilet and saw Classmate-M-02 and he went into the other toilet. I realised I'd gone into the men's and walked out as he walked out of the ladies and he laughed and said something like 'no I didn't, Izzy' and we went into the right toilet. I went into a cubicle which was large and the doors were up high. A girl and a guy outside could see in (they were young, like 13). They wouldn't leave and I ended up chasing them out and kicking the guy in the butt (gently-ish). There were lots of people in the toilet, it was very crowded. Later I kicked someone in the balls (jokingly, not hard) and they 'pickpocketed' me and took my wallet. I grabbed it and kicked them again and they took my phone. I took my phone back and was like 'my brother used to do that to say like 'don't take your eyes away from your stuff or people will take it''.
