I was working on a website, doing updates. There was a page that introduced the team of people involved in whatever the site was for. Or, I may have suggested that there needed to be such a page and I was creating it. I was going to list the people in alphabetical order by first name, along with a one paragraph bio. However, this meant that I would be first on the list and I wasn't sure that I wanted to be first on the list. As I was trying to think of the people who needed to be included, I recalled that one person was Abby T, so she would be listed ahead of me. When I realized that, I was disappointed that I wouldn't be first on the list.
