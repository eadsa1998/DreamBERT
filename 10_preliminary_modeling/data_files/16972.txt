In the dream my friend Toby lives in LA, and we meet up after years of not seeing each other. He has an apartment in the centre. It reminded me of Soho in London. He takes me around the locality. We but beers and food and chat. He is excited about a side-line he has in batteries or battery acid. I ask for the recipe. Later I am back in London and I visit the hairdressers. Ralph is there. He knows my hairdresser well. We discuss my haircut. Ralph and the hairdresser encourage me to have something more artistic and unusual. For some reason I agree, and the plan evolves into me going back to LA to pick up some battery acid, and information about a new haircut. Next thing I know, Ralph and the hairdresser (who is a slim gay guy) are in LA with me. "I hope you're not going to charge me for the flights as part of my hairdressing fee" I joke, but ralph thinks I'm serious, and replies "No, we're just doing this for the fun of it". The haircut I end up getting is a quiff underneath, with longer hair on the outside. I don't actually know what the hell I have agreed to.
