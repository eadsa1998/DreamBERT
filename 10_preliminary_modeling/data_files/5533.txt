[1997-05-03] The next snippet dream is I was in the apartment, I think I had when I was in Springfield and it seems to be that I'm in my living room and I could see the sunlight coming in the window and I was listening to a tape on the tape recorder and my friend G was taping to me and she said that she wants me to copy her tape. I didn't have a duplicator and so it was really funny, I had to take 2 tape recorders, my little one and a larger one and I had them laid out on the floor, on the rug, in the living room of my apartment that I used to have way back in 1983. I was taping the tape and although I thought it was silly, I felt intimidated and thought that I had better do what she tells me and then the dream jumps to work, and suddenly the 2 tape recorders are there and the tapes are being made and I don't want the boss to see it, and he starts to express some kind of disagreement about something one of the counselors was doing and how they had to be away from the offices and how they had to drive away from the buildings and I go in the office and I'm doing my tapes and copying the tapes and I want him to think that its part of work, and then I'm trying to do some other work too. I wasn't sure what else I was doing, using some machine or something, but I had this idea that I had to keep busy and so I was sitting at the desk between the 2 tape recorders and trying to do another task with it so I could keep working.
