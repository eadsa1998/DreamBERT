I went to the sun. I got trapped there with some guy, who was sometimes George (Grey's Anatomy). Then it wasn't me and it had been a while and they'd had a kid. If you didn't press hard against the ground you floated. There were zombies around. They (the lady, George and the kid) needed to leave so they hid in the bathroom. Then it was me. The guy got bit, so he quickly went over his plan and his eyes were going white and then I shot him in the head. The kid and I hurried to this slide. We got in this scooter thing and went down. Then I ended up in a big city and people were making a movie with zombies. Then I was at home with Dad and Ezra. I looked out the back and saw Tinkerbell and I was like "What the hell?". Spaceman was somewhere and he looked dead, but then he moved and he was ok.
