I stepped on this thing and it hurt my foot. I was screaming in pain and Mom pulled it out and it was just this little hook on a metal rod and she asked why I was crying so much. Then she pulled out more and it turned into this big metal grabber thing [I watched Doctor Who last night, the episode with the metal things]. I wondered what I'd stepped on. I was later in this room with a few bees. I built a fake bee hive outside to draw them out but someone opened the door and they came in. I tried to get the cats away so they didn't get stung. I was looking after a bag of GBCS ID's and someone put them over the important bee thing and when I took it off more came. Hector was around.
