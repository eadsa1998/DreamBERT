I was lying in bed half asleep trying to get the p.p. winner in the first race at Ascot tomorrow. I was counting sheets of paper in my hand. I had six sheets. I was down at White's in the woodwork. A storm was coming up. I went out looked up and the sky was yellowish. I said, "A tornado is coming." I went inside under a side of the building and I heard the tornado roar. I got under a steel freight car for protection. All at once the car was raised up and the car started to whirl around us in a circle about 2 ft. off the ground. I was sitting on it. It sort of flew off on a side and the car crashed into the side of the building and stopped. The storm was over. I started to walk up the stairway. I asked for the fourth floor and the man said the 3rd floor and on top. I got a hold of some pipes and everything was loose and I almost fell back, but finally got up. I heard there were some children killed swimming in the storm. It was a dark night. I was looking at some pictures and all at once they were movies. I saw Jimmy Clear come into the picture. He sat down and then moved away. Bob and I walked after him. We came to him and he seemed to be in a rocket. I said a few words to him and his rocket moved out of my way as though he were afraid of me. There was a big passenger boat out all lit up and anchored away from shore. A small boat went out and brought in the big boat with speed and ease to shore and harbor.
