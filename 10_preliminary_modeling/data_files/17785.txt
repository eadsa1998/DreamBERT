I believe I was in the back seat of my car with someone- my friend Celia, I think.  We were parked near the water's edge on a cloudy day.  There was grass, and there were lots of people around.  It was like a survival clan.  There had been a lot of destruction and the group was coming together to try and survive the decimation.  I was frustrated and anxious from dealing with the situation and I wanted escape.  Celia, a guy, and I decided to take off, just go as far as we could away from the group in spite of the risks.  We ran at an unrealistically fast speed across the barren grassy field.  Every once in a while there would be a pit of water, but managed to leap over it, treating it as nothing.  Eventually we got to the end of the land.  We stopped by an interesting tree.  It had thin branches spiraling upward around it almost like a ramp or stairs.  We ascended into the tree.  They started to arrange things- this would be their home.  I was relieved with this, and I think I ran back to tell my parents where I would be a lot of the time if they ever needed me.
