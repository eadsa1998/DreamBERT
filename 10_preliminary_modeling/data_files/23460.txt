My husband Ken and his mom are talking on the phone but I can hear everything she's saying to him. She's telling him she was sorry that a women he saw at a conference (before coming to be with me) didn't respond to his message that he wanted to marry her because she felt she couldn't be treated with such disregard by him. His mom obviously preferred this woman and though Ken and I are married now, it didn't matter. I was listening and watching Ken from a distance -- I wasn't there but I was there -- he didn't know it -- and he seemed sad about what she was saying.
