Bill C had just come back from vacation. We went to have lunch. When we walked in the restaurant we noticed that Blair K was there having lunch with someone. Bill C ducked behind a wall because he didn't want Blair K to see us. He wanted us to be able to have lunch alone and catch up on business issues. He wasn't sure how he wanted to deal with Blair K yet. He wasn't successful. Blair K had seen him and came up to us. He invited us to join them. Bill C just told him that we needed to catch up on business issues. Blair K returned to his table and the hostess seated us. We were sitting there eating at a six-foot long table. I was at the very left end of one side and Bill C was across from me, but in the second to last chair. There were people we didn't know seated next to me. While we were waiting Theresa S and Stephen S along with another CRHP sister and her husband came up and decided to join us, without being invited or asking if it was okay. I don't know who the other CRHP sister was. It was though it was not a waking life CRHP sister. Theresa S and Stephen S sat down to my left at the end of the table. The other couple sat to Bill C's left. They were talking to each other, kind of across us. I introduced them to Bill C, though they didn't really seem to pay attention or acknowledged each other. I could tell by the look on Bill C's face that he was aggravated because he had wanted to discuss business with me. I was uncomfortable and not sure what to do. I finally leaned over to Theresa S and said, I'm really sorry. I don't want to be rude. But this is my boss and he had wanted this to be a working lunch for us. She apologized and said that was fine. Bill C and I got up and went to sit at another table.
