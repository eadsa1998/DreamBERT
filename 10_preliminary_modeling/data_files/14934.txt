I was at the hospital. Granny was still in there but they moved her somewhere else. Nana got a call saying they were changing Poppers's medication. Dad called and Granny had died. Nana and others we there and she cried. I had mail and there were lots of like little bits from fragile packages and notepads. Mom was there too. Then I was at a school place. This teacher guy was saying we would be ok if we ate pumpkin pie, do well at Monopoly and something else. Me and the guy next to me said at the same time, "I hate pumpkin!". Then I was actually reading a story in a magazine. This other guy pulled his hat off and said 'I'll show you how to eat pumpkin pie". He put some on his fork and pretended to put it in his mouth, but put it into his shoe. He did that for a bit and then said "Because it's punishable by death, you've got to put it on the guy next to you". The story said the class cracked up for 715 minutes. I was at a house later looking at photos that I hadn't seen before. There were some of me and Aunt Sally.
