I remember today's dream very vaguely. I would even say that I don't remember it, except that I have in my mind the picture of a pair of violet glasses, round and big, like the ones a friend of mine once gave me and that these glasses were small for me and that I broke them while trying to get them on. I remember that at the time I was trying them on, someone was with me, but I don't remember who it was because even in the dream, I could not see the person.
