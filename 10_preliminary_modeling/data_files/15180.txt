I was at a beach thing with people from The Office. Angela and I had had a fight a while ago -- the last few days she had started to like me. Then, she told me something in private (not important) and I had angrily told Lily (How I Met Your Mother), who had told everyone else. She eventually told me it was fine and I said that I shouldn't have said anything. We went down to the pool. The beach had a 'house' on an island in the middle. Angela was wearing a bikini, but the top was like a top instead of a bra. She had brought us there. The house was on fire and I got my phone out to record it. The writers of the show had made Andy roofie someone and have sex with them. They decided they didn't like a 'nice guy' doing that, so they made him evil and I was like 'aw, but I like Andy'.
