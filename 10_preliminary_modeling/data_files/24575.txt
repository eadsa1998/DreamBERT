I had to read in a book. The book (in real life) said, "I have to pay $50 and nothing was wrong with (the) TV." And in my dream, me and my mom and my sister were on a road trip and it was night. It was dark, and even with the lights on we couldn't see. So I said let's go fix them, and my mom said, "Well, it will probably cost $50, and they will tell me nothing is wrong." Setting: In my car, out in nowhere. Characters: Me, my mom, my sister. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared. I think that now, after this dream, what happens in the real life affects your dreams.
