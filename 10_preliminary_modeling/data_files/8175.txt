I was burning a CD at work after finishing some project. I was having lots of problems. The file was too large. I think I ended up having to burn two CD's. I put some files on one CD and some on another. I was dreaming about the QL file in particular and kept trying all kinds of things hoping I could get it to fit on just one CD.
