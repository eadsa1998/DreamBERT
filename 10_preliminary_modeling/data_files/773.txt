I was in a house. Ants were crawling all over everything. I was appalled. "Yuck." I tried to find way out without touching them. "It's just like in that movie," I said. I opened the door and went out. There were lots of people. Then I was an ant (only still my real self). A large person (woman) came to contemptuously step on me. "Get in that hole," she sneered. I was laying down and trying to squeeze under a post. I didn't fit.
