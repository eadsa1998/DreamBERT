My Spanish class was hosting this party. I think it was for some new guests or something. And we were kind of at a place that was kind of like our house and kind of like something different. And we were arranging this buffet on our dining table, and I had given them two little Styrofoam balls and they crafted one to look like a pond and they put water in it, and they crafted another to look like a fountain. And they made this house out of cardboard with like a big roof and like white in the front, and they like made it sort of longer than higher, and that was kind of a backdrop of the buffet. And I think I climbed up on the chair at the side of the table, and I grabbed the jug of water and I poured myself a glass. And then I sort of went along down through the buffet and I got through these things. And I can't remember what the significance of all this was. There had to be more to it, but heck if I remember.
