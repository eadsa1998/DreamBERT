They belong to the bad guy. The male robot man is there and Ellie says he should be allowed to listen to baseball games. He loves them. The bad guy says, "Well, why not?" He puts his arm around him and says, "Is that what you want?" The robot doesn't respond but Ellie insists that is what he wants. Another bad guy robot says he can't hear them, so let him read about it. Ellie insists he can hear them. She says he's audio. (NLP) I grab him and lay him down, with my legs wrapped around him in a wrestler hold and I say things and watch his eye patterns. "Yes, he is audio," I confirm. The woman robot says she wants to be pregnant. The bad guy agrees. The second bad guy robot says, "How can you do this?" The bad guy says, "It's OK, it's just hypnotist stuff." They do it and then I have them back. The robot bad guy says, "Then I have a favor to ask of you. Will you put this package in MY car? (he owns it but because he's a robot the other guy uses it) and put a nice saying with it." I put my arm around his shoulder and hug him teasingly, "You mean something sentimental and nice?" I ask. "Like "1-2-3-4, beat it, beat it." It's a joke and I laugh. [BL]
