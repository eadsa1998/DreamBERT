[At Joshua Tree, the BLM one, by St. George Utah.]  I am in a house.  First I am aware that a woman wants to be my love partner, then I notice Paul V (my middle sister's ex-boyfriend) is waiting for me in bed.  I tell the woman I really want to be with her and keep explaining myself but she says, Tara, you don't have to explain.  Paul and I start to have sex.  It's sensual and fun but I can't get his penis in.  It's not totally hard.  I am on top.  The last scene is me looking down at my thighs around Paul, sitting on him but moving back and forth, squeezing my thighs into him and out.  It's fascinating to feel and watch.
