I met Bill C at a restaurant. We were having a focus group. There were three women who were joining us for this focus group. One was Cathy L. One I don't know now who it was. One we called Annie W but it was Debbie We. Kara C was there also. Bill C had gone and hung up his and Kara C's coats. When the women came in I took them to our tables. They were hanging their coats on the back of their chairs. We all had long coats on so they were dragging on the floor. I had to come up with a way to push a lot of it through the back of the seat so it wouldn't drag on the floor. Then I sat on it that way. I showed the other women my idea. Then I saw someplace to hang them so I took them and hung them up. In the meantime Bill C was waiting in line for something. When the three women came in I said hello to Cathy L and then to the other woman. Then I said hello to Annie W. She asked if she knew me and I said yes. You know me as Elizabeth H although I go by Anna now. She didn't say anything else. We had the meeting. We got up and got our coats to leave. There was also something about some reports or papers or something and we needed to edit it maybe. There was something that wasn't quite right and I think I was telling Bill C what we needed to do to correct it.
