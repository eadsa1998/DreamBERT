I'm in my office building, having left the office for a break or an errand, and I'm on my way back. This place bears more of a resemblance to where Lori works at the museum than to the library, it's sort of a maze of offices and walls and steps and corridors, but nice anyway, there's light and air. I'm scooting along on my chair (my back chair, only with wheels), and I think people are going to think I'm crazy. I pass a couple of people in the drafting area who turn and look at me. I'm going through some unfamiliar offices because I took a wrong turn somewhere. I'm in my own kitchen, trying to trap a scorpion on the floor with a wad of paper towel. I'm really determined to get it because scorpions are so dangerous, and I've got to be real careful. I'd take it outside if I could, like the cockroaches, but I don't believe I can. It escapes me for a while but I get the paper towel over it and squash it - not very hard, but when I lift it up to see if I've killed it, there's nothing left but goo mostly. I didn't think they were that fragile.
