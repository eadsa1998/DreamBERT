I was standing next to my sister. Her body was slender and her features were beautiful. Her skin was soft and pale white. My mother and a strange woman about 35 were nearby. My sister came near and rested her shoulders on my left arm. My sister looked lovingly and caressingly at me, and she seemed to want me to kiss her, so I did. As we kissed, she seemed to feel a little guilty, and I supposed it was because we were brother and sister. But she did not move away. I was dressed in pajamas, and my fly felt as though it were open. I felt a tingle in my organ, and I looked down, intending to close my fly. My sister thought I wanted her to touch my organ, so she put her hand on it. When she touched my organ, I felt uneasy, as though the pleasure of the embrace had been spoiled.
