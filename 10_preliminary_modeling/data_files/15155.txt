Rachel and Puck (both from Glee) were in detention, colouring in pictures of fruits and vegetables. All of his were green. She said she hadn't been to the doctors since "I saw you". On Chuck, there was a kid with magic powers. A girl related to Casey was staying with him. He brought her a plate with snacks in bed and she said that she thought she was only leaving her badger and some other animal for a couple of days and she couldn't stay anymore. He said Sarah would call her and leave her on speakerphone until she had had a certain conversation -- they were trying to get her to join their group and were leaving hints. The magic kid put glasses on weirdly and pretended to ride a broomstick, which made everything disappear but then it came back again. Raquel and I made a movie together. I had written the plot and she had written the dialogue. Mom was there.
