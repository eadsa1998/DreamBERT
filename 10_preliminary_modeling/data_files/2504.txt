Now I'm visiting Ginny and Ernie. But Ginny is very busy. She has lots of things to do, so I just hang out with her, kind of disappointed that we can't kick back and relax. Ginny has diarrhea and Ernie has a hurt back (bad back or shoulder). He talks about therapy he has to do. We decide to go out to eat. We drive. I'm in passenger seat looking for a restaurant. He finds a very fancy one, a "Shakespeare" restaurant, but we all agree we couldn't afford it. I ask, "What's the next town?" I see indentations in the sand and then I remember it's snow. It's a photo I took, round eye holes in footprint-like shapes (see drawing).
