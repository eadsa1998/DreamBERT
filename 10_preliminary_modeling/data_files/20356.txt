I was on a street. There was a printing press there about 500 feet long. There was no pressman around. Sheets about 4 by 4 feet were being printed. I tried to take one of the sheets out as they went along the conveyor belt into the bin. But when I took out a sheet, the other sheets began to jam. I could not understand what caused them to jam since I was careful not to jam them when I took out the sheet. I looked for a switch to turn off the press, but it stopped automatically. Several other presses were there. I looked for the way back from which I had come. I had a difficult time, because the street was jagged. When I found my way back, my mother was waiting for me.
