I am a band leader, but I've not much experience. I am to direct a musical extravaganza. Hundreds of uniformed band members are milling around, looking to me for direction. I can't find my scripts, so I glance through a book and start telling the "regulars" to march over there and the "federales" to march to another spot. They all march away and I frantically search for the score and script. Soon I notice they aren't coming back. I feel I've lost control.
