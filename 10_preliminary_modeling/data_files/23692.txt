Allen (my good friend from high school) and I are out partying.  Lots of traveling around, some car scenes, headlights?  Allen is okay, then he starts to have like drug withdrawal spasms or coming off drugs.  He's spazzing out, shaking, convulsions.  Scares me.  I try to get him home, which is hard.  I'm pulling him at one point - we're out by the road, and half his middle finger comes off in my hand and goes flying.  I ignore it and get him home.  Curvy roads, narrow, dark.  Next morning I ask him how his hand is.  He pulls it up and notices for the first time that half his finger is missing.  Sadness, anxiety.  When I woke up - 2 things in mind.  First, I was repeating the phrase "time is time for asbestos" or "the time is the time for asbestos".  (They're doing asbestos testing here at the fire crew houses at Blue Ridge.)  Also, I had the feeling some character had been pleading for something in the dream, over and over.  Like "please mister can we sleep here?  or stay here?"  Or "do something".  Feeling it had to do with Marten (fellow park ranger, casual lover, never a boyfriend) telling me about the kids dying in the car crash he responded to.  Like one of them asking?
