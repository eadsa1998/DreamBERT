I'm in a room with lots of other people. Something's wrong with my arm or leg. Therese (a hard of hearing student) plays nurse. She grinds up a Wright's Aspirin. I refuse to take it until I know what's in it. She's annoyed with me and I explain that I react badly to caffeine. She calls the doctor, a Japanese man, who'll come look at me later. I am playing patient, somehow.
