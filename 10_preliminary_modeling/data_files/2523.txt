I'm at school, in a class, and I'm sort of the star pupil, like in Jeb's class. I talk a lot and then wonder if people are pleased with me or if they get bored hearing me so much and tune me out. The class is over and we get up to go to the next event. Someone comes up and says they enjoyed what I had to say. We then go to the restroom where I go into a stall that doesn't even have a toilet. The next stall has a toilet where someone peed on the floor a little. I pee a lot, reminding myself that it's OK, this isn't a dream. I then have to leave to go to the auditorium. My girlfriends and I go in and I say, "I want to sit in the back even if I can't see or hear things as well, just in case I have to leave to go to the bathroom." I then see Darryl. There is one seat next to him and two seats in front of him and I say, "Let's sit there. Come on." I rush and sit next to him. He and his friends quickly move over three or four seats like I had leprosy or something. I am hurt and so I decide not to show that I know him. Another girl sits in the seat next to me and I say, "These two seats are saved for my friends." The girl moves but she's catty and uppity first. I sit watching the show on stage pretending I don't know Darryl. At the end, I get up to walk away. He comes up to me and says, "Hi," and smiles, hugging me. I melt into his arms, forgetting all my anger. We walk out, still in an embrace, me facing him, standing on his feet, feeling happy to be with him.
