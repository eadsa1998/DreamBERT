These people invited us to a really fancy theater that had candy in the seats. So we went, and two of my friends were there, but the show was with elves and it was very stupid. So we went to the bathroom and I got the candy. Then I went back and got stopped and had to talk to a lot of people. Then I got more candy and got stopped again and finally the night was over. Setting: Fancy theater. Characters: My mom, my dad, two friends and myself (and a lot of people). Feelings and Thoughts: Annoyed. It was weird. I don't know what to say.
