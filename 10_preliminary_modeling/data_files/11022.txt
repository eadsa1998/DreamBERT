In this dream I remember playing a part in a play. I had done a very good job and many people had told me that I had talent. I was quite enthused and decided to make a career of the stage. I started taking dramatic lessons, but told no one about it. Finally, one day I was given the opportunity to play a small part in a play in Broadway. I was very pleased and excited and quite proud, and I decided to tell my boyfriend , TG, about it. He was very happy for me and encouraged me a great deal. However, when we told his parents, they became infuriated and told me that if I went on the stage I could not marry their son Ted. The last thing I remember is Ted talking to his parents about it and trying to reason with them. Before anything definite had been decided, the telephone rang and woke me up.
