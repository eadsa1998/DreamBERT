I need to talk to Matt. He has done something wrong and caused some trouble for my organization. I overhear some other members of the organization that we need a new secretary. I think, "That is fitting the punishment to the crime. He can be the secretary and help out." That will undo what he had done. I open the door to go in search of him and I see him standing there! I am surprised and pleased at how the universe provides exactly what you need.
