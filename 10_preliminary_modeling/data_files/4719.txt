I am in a house. My brother Dwight is visiting. He brought my parents. They are old, sick and frail. I'm not feeling so strong myself. Dwight decides to leave. I realize he's leaving my parents there and I'll have to take care of them. I call after him. No. This isn't fair. I tell Dwight I have to work at my job. I can't be here all the time. He leaves. My mother needs to use the bathroom. My father decides to go downstairs to nap. I show my mother the upstairs bathroom. It is short like a vanity under the sink. I tell her it will be very uncomfortable for her. I open the vanity door. It is impossible for anyone to use that bathroom. I give up and am tired so I go downstairs leaving my mother alone, lying on a couch. I go down a long hall remembering my bedroom is at the end and to the left. It's been years since I've seen this bedroom. I see the bathroom door on the right. I go into my bedroom. (Old house, like recurring many roomed old houses in other dreams.) Charla comes in. I ask her to help me make my bed. She agrees. Then I see a worm on the folded bedspread (white) at the foot of the bed. I ask her to remove the worm because I don't want to touch it. She turns her back on me and says no. I get furious. I scream at her. Do you want to fight? I'll lose control, is that what you want? I am daring her to not be helpful so I can hit her and scream at her. She ignores me.
