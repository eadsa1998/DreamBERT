I had just finished my lunch at home and was riding a red bicycle back to Shaker Heights High School. As I rode along Lee Road, I noticed how dark the sky was becoming. Large gray clouds completely obscured the sun that had been shining a few minutes before. I knew I must hurry for it would rain very soon. Upon reaching the school I parked my bike and hurried to my English class. The entire class was present and only my chair in the front row was vacant. As I entered the classroom I had a strange feeling that I had been absent from this class for a great length of time. Yet no one seemed to be surprised at my arrival. In fact no one in the entire room said a word to me. The class consisted of both my high school and college friends, but I was puzzled and disappointed that my girlfriend was not present.
