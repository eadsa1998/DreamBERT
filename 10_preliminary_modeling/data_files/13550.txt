I was living by myself at home. But then it was some other house. We did something to the roof (changed the pattern and stuff). This new guy across the road copied, but it was a little bit different. Ezra got a new car and the guy got a similar one. The door to my house was this stingy thing with cloth which blew about. I had this little table outside. The guy took it and I took it back. He came over and wanted me to come to his place and I said no. He came back a little while later with these two really big chickens. I called Mom and told her to get me. The chickens came in and were like dogs. I was screaming and went outside. I then said "Ok! I'll go to your place!" and he took them off.
