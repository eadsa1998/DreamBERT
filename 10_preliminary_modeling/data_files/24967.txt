 I ask my roommate Jens Nils to do his laundry. I get the usual crap-filled feeble excuse. Then he admits that he doesn't know how. He asks me to do it for him. I scream at him, "No, fuck no!". I tell him I'll show him how. He has a pair of yellow pants, a pair of white pants, and his sheets. We borrow laundry tokens from Stephen. I find a 1954-penny when Stephen gives us the laundry tokens. The yellow bleeds onto the white pants. My friend Jimmy Youngman is then Jens, and he's not picky that the yellow pants bled onto his sheets too.
