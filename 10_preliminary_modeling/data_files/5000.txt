I am an ex-con running from a Mafia boss. I'm driving a stolen mob car, black and fast. I am panicked, trying to elude them, speeding past the cars on the freeway. I see a dirt road and squeal on to it quickly. I hide in the trees. I see them slow up and look for me. I see a cotton men's plaid shirt tacked to a tree. They leave, I escape in a roll of dust. Now I am swimming in a terribly treacherous white water river. I barely make it after crashing over a water fall. I creep up over the bank to safety. I go back to the prison and sneak down the stairs hoping no one sees me. I see chickens in the cells. I make it to the front office and bravely walk straight for the front door. No one stops me. I stop myself and ask them if they remember me. The guard resting on a bunk is surprised. So is the woman clerk. I hear the news that if I don't qualify for a boxing match by 3:00 that day, I'll be locked up forever. I am trapped. I get on my knees and beg the guard to take the necessary papers over so I can qualify in proxy. I weep passionately. He relents and goes. Then a pox from mice sweeps the prison and all the inmates turn to shorn sheep. If I can't get out in time for the match, I'm doomed. One of the sheep baaing notices I haven't changed. I point out that I must have had it before or am immune. [BL]
