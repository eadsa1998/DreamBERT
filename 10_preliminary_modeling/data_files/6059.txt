I was riding up a street in the neighborhood and stopped at this girl's house to borrow a school book. It was 11 pm. All the lights were out in her house. I rang the bell and her mother answered. She had to go upstairs and get her. While I was waiting, I turned into someone else. My car door was open. A guy came out of his house and was threatening the lady. The next time I loked at her she was burnt (but like in cartoons, not really raw red burn). Then she tried to get away from him in a cornfield. The next scene they were on a cruise ship. There was a lounge. The bartender was talking to another guy. The lady came in and tried to make a scene like they were arguing in an attempt to get some help. The bartender was too busy listening to the other guy. Then the couple disappeared. I think they were just looking over the railing of the ship.
