I was over at a nearby university in the dorm where I used to live with my daughter. I was talking to my former roommate and to this other girl, Mary, and I don't remember exactly what we were talking about, and then we went down and got into my roommate's care to go somewhere. She had to go somewhere and we were going along with her, Mary, my daughter and I. So we had gotten to wherever it was she was going and she had gotten out of the car. Then Mary, my daughter, and I got out to sort of walk around in this little park until my roommate came back. So we walked around and I was sort of showing my daughter what she could do and everything. There were some swings and a see-saw there. So we decided to see-saw my daughter and we did that for a little while. I was telling Mary all the different words my daughter knew.
