I'm at a hotel. B B of the community college is the owner We are gathered around a table. I notice Phyllis (a TV star on Rhoda) is not there and I say to B. she should see what's in her safety deposit box. B goes and looks. She comes back and confides that there's millions of dollars in there. I nod knowingly. "She robbed the bank," I say. B suggests we don't tell and split the money. I notice Phyllis is among us now and shush B, but too late. Phyllis hears. She asks the crowd how many would agree to keep silent and split the money. Lots of hands go up. I tell them they will be accomplices. They don't care. I quietly leave to go tell the police. Several others go to their embassies to tell. So we come back, followed by platoons of each group. I have squad cars, one Arab has white-robed Arabs all in a row, etc.
