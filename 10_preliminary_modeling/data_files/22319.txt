This time I was accompanied by my friend P. and shopping in a store, a rather large clothing store. We had gone shopping for slacks. Somebody had brought us there by car; they were older people, I think female relatives. I don't remember buying any slacks, but my friend P. did buy one from among the piles of trousers, classified according to their color. He couldn't decide between a light brown or a light green one. I advised him to get the green one and we bought it in a hurry because the people who brought us were waiting for us. Furthermore, I had gone into the store to see why he was taking so long, and I was even looking for him along the corridors (there were many of these since the items were on small square counters).
