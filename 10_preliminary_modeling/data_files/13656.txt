I was at school. I wasn't in uniform, but I don't remember why I was there. I went to leave and called Mom to pick me up. Ms Newberry saw me and told me off for having my phone. I said that I wasn't here today. I came back later and called Mom to pick me up again and she refused so I started walking. Elijah was walking in front of me and I caught up with him. There were these bags of fertilizer or something and we throwing them at each other. This blue stuff got on him. We were laughing and he fell and I got ahead of him. I got home and I called Mom.
