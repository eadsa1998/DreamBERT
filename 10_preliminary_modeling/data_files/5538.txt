[1997-05-06] My tape recorder had run out of batteries which was kind of a surprise, I was using my little one, I was holding it in my hand and I was pushing the play button to check it and I could tell by the pitch that the batteries were going, so I went into my bedroom, opened up my top drawer to get the batteries out and when I felt around for the 2 little double-As, next to them was a little tiny cup about an inch high and it had a handle on it and I said "no, that's not a battery". I left the cup in there, and put the new batteries in and was surprised that the old batteries had run out since I hadn't been listening to the recorder that long a time.
