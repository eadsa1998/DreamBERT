Me and my brother Max were swimming in the ocean. I jumped off a cliff to join him, and we decided we'd stay there overnight. So then we had to go to higher ground, and we hiked up a bunch of hills as the sun was setting (it was really pretty), then found a cabin we could stay in, that nobody else was using. Then my parents stopped by to make sure everything was okay, and that I had taken my contacts out. Setting: In the ocean along the beach, in kind of a hilly area surrounding the ocean, in a cabin. Characters: My brother, and my parents who came at the end of the dream. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy. It was a nice dream, because it was really pretty, what with the ocean and the sunset.
