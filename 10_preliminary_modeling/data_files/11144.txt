I was standing at the kitchen door when suddenly two of my cousins whom I haven't seen for quite some time appeared. Nothing happened or was said except that they thought I had changed a great deal since they last saw me. Then I was outside holding a little girl (in a white dress) in my arms while at the same time I was dancing the polka. Someone was laughing at me because I looked so funny. For some reason I felt cramped for space. Next I found myself sitting on a porch swing, but when I saw my grandfather coming, I tried to hide between the swing, and instead of there being a solid wall behind me, it was open and he saw me. My sister was sitting on the swing and she said he found me because my feet extended out beyond the swing.
