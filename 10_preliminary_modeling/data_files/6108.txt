I was home at my mother's house with a bunch of people: Carey, Sascha, Lisa and Candy and some others. We were building a whirlpool in the backyard. We had to rake the yard first and figure out a location that would be best and where there were the fewest trees. I was raking near some bushes and found some old magazines with the cast of LA Law on the cover. I then went into my mom's house and we were sorting out the mail that came. For some reason Carey's friend Lisa gave us a present. It was a necklace with charms on it. Then we all were outside looking at the mail and went back in.
