From Dusk Till Dawn [on last night] - the place where they shot the pyramid bit was an actual place and for some reason I thought I'd been there though it like in Mexico but then we there and there a photo album where people posted to say they'd been there and I found pics of myself from when I was like 4. It was creepy and dark in there. There was a weird person hanging around. I can't remember properly but I think I (except not me) killed someone and was on the run. I kept meeting with people and then killing them. One girl I kept throwing around but she wouldn't die. She was all twisted though.
