 It is winter. I am at home out on the front sidewalk shoveling really wet, heavy snow. High school has been delayed. It is really early in the morning. My high school classmate Craig Jard and some other guys are there. They are jerks: I don't like them. We fake fight, and I use my shovel. It is clear I could beat them up. I go to the back door from the kitchen. The outside door and the screen door are both open. I close the screen door and then show my classmate Acelyn how to close the outside door to the porch. She has trouble closing it. I show her how. It is mostly just pulling the door really hard. There is a girl in the garage that is having trouble closing the door there. The door to the garage from the kitchen is open. The garage light is on. I see a young woman with a long pole in the garage. She is pointing the pole at the door that goes from the garage to the driveway.
