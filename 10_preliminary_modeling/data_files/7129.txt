Several of the ladies were sitting around reading newspapers but my copy was gone. I asked each one if she had it but none had. Mrs. Hens. said she had borrowed mine but had returned it. I was irritated and scolded her for taking it before I had read it. Finally I found Mrs. Bell had it and she returned it to me. I had my purse under a box of candy and put the newspaper on top. It was 7:45 almost time for breakfast but first there was a meeting. Beyond the folding doors several were seated in a semicircle waiting for the meeting. Then he (an unidentified friend) came to take me to the program. He remarked on my green dress and then said, "I like dresses." "Then you should go to a country where men wear skirts." He started to get us seats on the right side of the hall but I said that on account of my deaf ear, I wanted to sit on the other side so my good ear would be toward the speaker. He told me to find our seats. I found seats in the balcony on the far left side. Waved to him. Some one had put a hat on the seat next to ours to hold it and as he joined me, a family of four or five came in pushing us over too far so we went two rows further front and found seats.
