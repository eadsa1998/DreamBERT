Mabel and I are trying to put together a puzzle. We pick pretty beads from a basket and place them where they belong. I think Shea was there too. Later, I take some kids to the store. A couple of teens take some candy. I tell them to put it back. Then I see Paulina scooting out the door quickly. I run after her and stop her. She has candy in her mouth! I say, "How dare you! Take it back at once! I'll lose respect and love for you." I am very angry, and she goes back. She and I go to the clerk. I say, "She took this candy." The clerk shrugs and says, "Oh well, teens do that." A man walks up to me and puts a soda bottle on the counter. He says, "You pay for it and I'll reimburse you later." I am so busy with Paulina I don't really attend and agree. Then I turn to see who this is. I know him well and I laughingly agree to do so. [BL]
