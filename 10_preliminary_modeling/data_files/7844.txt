I was having my period. Twice I took a tampon out and put a new one in. I took one and wrapped it in a piece of paper no bigger than the tampon and pushed it together. I was in a car with Matthew and two other girls. Matthew was supposed to be taking one of them to the prom. He was in a black tux with a white shirt and white tie. I thought I really like that he decided to go with a white tie this year. Then I found out that the girls were sisters and they were both going with him to the prom. I was driving with the two girls and someone else in the car. I was driving from the back right passenger seat and was having trouble seeing. I was looking for a place to pull off so I could change places with the person in the front left so I could see better to drive. When I tried to pull off the road I was knocking over trashcans and stuff. Even after we made the change I was still. The place that I had to go forward and try to get out of there, there were all these trash cans and I kept running over them and knocking them down trying to get out of there. I also remember something about the road. It seemed to me that it was steep and very windy. the one girl, the one that Matthew was supposed to be taking to the prom, had some kind of psychological problems. I was supposed to be her psychologist and working with her and I said I couldn't work with her because she was gay and attracted to me. Of course, the feelings weren't mutual and she got really upset. I can't remember if she threatened to hurt herself or me. I held strong and continued to.
