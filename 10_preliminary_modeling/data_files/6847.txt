We are calling the boys to hurry up so we can catch the bus. We are leaving a feast. One little boy is in the toilet. As we leave the church, I see R. has left her big tan bag and return for it. Ask the woman in pew behind if she's sure it isn't hers. The bag is very heavy and I decide to leave it at the church office so R. won't have to return so far for it as I'm sure it's hers. The secretary tells me she will look after the bag and that out that door is a short cut. I start out and find I've left my white and green umbrella which was hanging on my arm and start back for it. Afraid I will miss the train. Maybe if I leave through main entrance it will be quicker. Oh, I needn't worry about missing the train. This is all a dream.
