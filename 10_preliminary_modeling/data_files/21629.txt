I asked Steve if a pin was holding a loose screw that was held in the gauge. He said yes. We walked over a bed of dirt. He dug a hole into the bed of dirt and there was swirming and squirming young larvae that was to be pins. I picked up some with my fingers and one must have got down my back because I could feel it go down and it tickled me. I looked at the time and it was 1 o'clock a.m. I looked at a window and it had mud or something smeared on it. Also there was broken panes with holes in them. The boy pulled down the shade and John Scronzo raised and looked at it.
