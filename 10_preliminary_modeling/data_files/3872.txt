["Packing To Visit Paulina."] I am packing my clothes into a bag to visit Paulina. I have trouble finding something that will fit. I have gained weight. I look at the dresses. They are all halter top summer dresses. I don't want to expose my fat and flabby arms. One black dress will do, but just barely. I am frustrated.
