 I go into a dorm room. My friend Hilary Nano's roommate Annette Gollum is sleeping there. I have several floppy disks I want to give or do something with. I go out of the room, and into Hilary's room, where my high school friend Gino Teavor is in a bed. A friend of his, named Kari, may be there. Gino and I talk about spring break and Arizona. There is paint on a wall or ceiling. Someone is doing back flips on this paint. Gino says he and his friend are using thumbtacks to keep track of each other. I think that's sad: they're all tied up. I tell Gino to call 1-800-Arizona.
