I was on IMDb and I had my own page. I had been in a few things when I was younger, including Teletubbies. I also had a role in a movie from 2008 as 'agent'. Michael C. Hall was also in it. I didn't remember doing it. I was on my message board and I had a few comments. One guy was saying how I wasn't very good in some show I had been in when I was like four and because I'd been in another episode I must've known the director, as the same guy directed both those episodes. In the second episode I had a minor role as a dog and I barked once.
