["Exhausted, slept through class."] Celeste is teaching a class in the morning. I wake up in time to go. Then I fall asleep again because I am so exhausted. I wake up again and am dismayed and surprised I slept through the class and it is 1pm now. Celeste returns. I feel embarrassed. I am also anxious because this has been several weeks that I haven't attended the classes. I decide I don't really want those classes and decide to drop out of the classes. Celeste is friendly and helpful. She has good strong energy.
