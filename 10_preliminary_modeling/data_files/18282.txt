I dreamed I was going with my parents and my husband to see a statue we had heard of in the De Young  Museum -- the "House of the Friendly Doors." The museum was closed, but the guide told us where the statue was, and accompanied us to see it and tell us about it, as otherwise it wouldn't be understandable. The statue was of a seated man with a woman on his knee, and another man standing, all dressed in colonial style. The guide told us that this scene represented the first act of prostitution in America, when one a Dutchman had traded some of his goods for this woman's services. He proceeded to give us a long description of what had occurred, which at first was heard, then as if a movie, then I was in it. Although I would have thought that this would be a very quick and impersonal act, it actually became very long and more and more tender, and I was happy because the woman -- who was me by that time -- wasn't simply being used, but was being appreciated for her whole self (the man was reading notes on what to do next from a sort of script outline based on the original occurrence). It was very sexy and tender.
