I saw Innocent. I was working at White's. Benny Meader was supervising. I worked one shift, was home about 4 hours, then came back and worked another 8 hours. I was working on machines. I gauged one job and the hole was too deep. I showed it to Benny and it was really too deep. Then we were working on some patch-up concrete work. Then I was at the track and some horses won, which I knew, but I can't recall them now. Louie Kauffman (deceased) was at the track with some hot coffee. He offered a man a drink and he said, "Do you have a hooker in it?" and he said no. So the man drank it. Then I looked how the track was, and I saw and heard, "They run on a trail." I saw one horse go and it was an airplane. He was coming around the bend and was sort of shaking, then he flew up and started to spin and I said, "That's the end of him." He spun fast like a propeller and came down, crashed and exploded. I knew the pilot was dead. I awoke and was lying, trying to fall asleep and I heard, "Did you know Joe's dead?" A fellow told me he was told that a horse by the name of this won. He wrote it in my book. He wrote that. I wrote this. He was puzzled how it was written. We were kidding the girls where we work. We would bring them cigars for it was our anniversary. I was eating and we had an old cake. Ann said, "Do you think it is good?" We tried it and it was good, so I ate it. I heard a fellow say Gus won.
