My dream is set in a familiar setting, like school or home (either present or past), only it doesn't look the same. I just know that's where I am. There were double spiral staircases that went up to a bridge. The building was made of glass plates. There are people, not really any age, just a mass of men and women, coming and going. Some people I know, but I can't say for sure who they are. I ended up accidentally blowing something up. I felt guilty when I woke up.
