We are at a meeting of the Jung Assn.: many people I see a beautiful woman with blond hair in a black dress; hear a lecture in many languages; I lose my brown purse, or it was stolen; worried about my I.D. find my purse but it only has black socks left in it; I go back to the lecture hall and reach for a small green candy out of a bowl.
