I was at Camp Airport getting ready to go to Spain, and I had my bags and stuff and I was walking around and walking around thinking, and then I realized that I didn't know what city I was laying over in and I didn't know what time the flight was leaving, and I didn't know any kind of information. So I sat down on this railing to this stairwell and I was taking stuff out of my purse that I didn't need, like this vitamin bottle with one vitamin in it and these papers and stuff, and I called Mom on the cell phone and she couldn't really tell me a lot. And she was there like within two or three minutes of me calling, and she was saying that I should try to meet up with Mrs. Hollander's group but I didn't know where they were, and I think they had left already. And so, as it turned out, it was like late at night and there was nobody around to help me out, and they shut off the lights for the stairwell and I like started freaking out. And I just decided I wasn't going to go, and I like ripped my ticket and I got my bags, and I was ready to go home. And then I woke up.
