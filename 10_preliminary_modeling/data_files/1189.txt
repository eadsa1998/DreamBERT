A man wants to make love to me. I don't want him. He follows me around with a hard-on. My mother tells me to change my clothes. I say, "Not here! I'll do it in the bathroom." She says, "No, here will be fine." I say, "He's in the room." She says, "That's O.K." I get my undies, all lacy, and my black nylons and garters. I go to the closet to dress. He is constantly near, wanting me. I tell him I won't marry him. Some people are surprised. I go to school. The class is lined up for a marathon running race. He is supposed to go with the other half of the class, but he's in my line. He makes a false start. We all groan and wait for him to get back. Then the race starts. I out run him and then I am tired with the male winner. The crowd is pleased and surprised. The announcer says, "It's 100 yards to go and it's tied!" I put out all I have and I win by a nose (or rather a knee). The Queen is impressed. I even have my own stamps for the letters I'll send to tell people I won. Everyone is impressed.
