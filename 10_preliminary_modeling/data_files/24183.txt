The dream took place in a social setting with some friends of mine. I don't recall the actual place but it was in a party-type environment with lots of people standing around and some even dancing. I recall being with the person I'm dating now. I remember him saying he didn't want to be with me anymore and him turning talking to another girl. I remember feeling enraged with anger that I tried to punch him. I remember struggling and pushing him around. When I woke up I was really upset about the dream.
