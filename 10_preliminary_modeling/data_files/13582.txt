I was at school. I text the canteen to order my lunch. A teacher saw and asked what I was doing. I said "Oh, ordering my lunch, I forgot to do it earlier". She called me a liar. I showed them the message and then they went away a while later. I was then with a friend somewhere and they were buying mini M&amp;M's and I wanted some but realized I had no money. I couldn't get to my phone either. Nana called though, and she gave money to me but it was for Ezra. Outside was really foggy. Something was attacking me.
