I was with Mom in the car. We passed Stormwind St and I told her that Stormwind was a city in World of Warcraft. We went to a pet shop and there were mice and puppies. There was a shih-tzu and a weird Labrador. It had long fur and looked silver on the tips and was silky. There were kittens too. Ezra and I were waiting outside. There was a plant. We heard someone talking and Mom too. They mentioned us and I tried to hide behind a huge red capsicum. They caught us and accused us of snooping and I denied it and said we came to look at the plant. I had a little puppy and he got put in the microwave with Amelia's milk. He got too hot and I quickly got him out. Granma joked about Amelia being cute and me being ugly.
