 Barney Rubble's wife Betty from the Flintstones goes to visit Wilma Flintstone at her house. The house looks like a real house. The characters are large, and are dressed up in costumes, like puppet characters. Wilma goes to the door but can't talk loud so she dials the vax, which is a local internet connection, to talk louder.
