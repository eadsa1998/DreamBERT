I drove in my friend Chloe's car and her mom dropped us off on some unrecognizable road. Chloe, another friend, and I played on the street for a while, then rollerbladed (or maybe ice skated) to like a movie theater/bar/disco. The movie playing was a horror movie. As I left walked through the bar into the disco. Chloe and Robin eventually joined me, then Chloe's mom picked us up again, and dropped us off at the road we'd started on. We then discovered that one of the houses on the block belonged to our principal. Then we stole a bottle of Peach Nectarine sparkling juice that was outside his house, drank most of it...I can't remember past there... Setting: First on a suburban road I didn't recognize, then in a movie theater, a bar, and a disco. Characters: My friend Chloe, my friend Robin, Chloe's mom, and maybe my principal, though I'm not sue he actually made an appearance; oh, yes, and a guy named Atum who appeared very briefly. Feelings and Thoughts: I don't remember. I think it's a little odd that we were stealing sparkling juice from the principal, but it doesn't surprise me that we were trying to be stupid and rebellious.
