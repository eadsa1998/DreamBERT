We were supposed to meet Grandma and Grandpa at this little restaurant, kind of like the days when we used to meet them at Ruby's all the time. Then it got to where we would drive over to Ruby's, then it got to the point they didn't really want to go out that much any more. But it used to be we would meet them at Ruby's. Well, I dreamt that we were doing something like that, except it was like this little restaurant like Chucky Cheese, and there was this set of tables that had reserved that the waitress brought us to that had -- what should I say -- this little circle of, it was like a choo choo train merry-go-around thing and had these seats that people sat in that represented little animals, like there was a -- they didn't really look like the animals to the sight that I had, but I sort of had the notion and the waitress told me that they were animals. One was supposed to be a sheep, one was supposed to be a lion, and I can't remember what the others were. And they called it the Ziggety Zoo suite [laugh] or something stupid like that. And, let's see, I think I started riding in the sheep one, even though it was just sort of like a rocking chair with twirly whirls on the back, and it would go round and round and round and tipsing and over and upside down, and it dumped me out and I fell on the floor. And I think about that time Grandma and Grandpa came into the restaurant and my eyes were like closed. I could see darkness, I was coming into stage 1 sleep, but I sort of felt like they had the notion that I had fallen and I couldn't get up. And I was laughing hysterically still in my dream. And Mom was like, "She's asleep, she's asleep," on the floor there, and then I just kind of woke up.
