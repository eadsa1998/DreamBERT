I put my head on Howard's shoulder and it is sweet and warm. I hold a teen-aged kitten in my lap and it is all happy and excited when Dwight enters the room. I say to him, "Oh, of course, she's got a thing for you." Now I sit in a easy chair and a pudgy man I don't like sits in it with me, which makes it crowded. I feel sleepy and start to lean over to my left and lay my head on the arm of a man there. I shift position and the pudgy man tries to get me to lay my head on him, but I don't want to. My first thing I try to do is pretend I'm asleep, but then I wake up and say to him, "Don't."
