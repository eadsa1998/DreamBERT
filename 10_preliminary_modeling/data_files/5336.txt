I dreamed that I was at some summer school and Hermione was there. There was a sign that meant someone was dead. So Hermione had a blanket wrapped around her heat, so I guess we thought she was dead. Then Tyle was IM-ing me in class, but I couldn't see him anywhere. The whale, Free Willy, was there, and I had to play Text Twist to pass my final exam. I got the word "through." Then I saw Spike doing his laundry.
