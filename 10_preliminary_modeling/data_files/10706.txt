Donald, Wanda, and I are at a pool. There is one guy at the pool who is trying to pick up on Wanda. She dogged him. Everyone left and my brother appeared. The guy who she dogged was trying to talk to me. I ignored him. I was being stubborn. This other guy kept trying to get my attention. He tried everything and I kept ignoring him. He then started to kiss the spot on my neck. I couldn't move. I was paralyzed. I was caught between feeling pleasure and restraint.
