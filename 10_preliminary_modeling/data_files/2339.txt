I just bought an old run-down house in a poor neighborhood. I want to use it to showcase local talent. But I want the help of the neighbors to fix it up nice, so I invite them to come see two very talented little girls, one a one-year-old and the other 2 or 3 years old. They are shy, but when they get started dancing and singing, they are very good! The audience is in one of the rooms, no furniture, the wall paper is peeling. They really like the girls.
