I'm in some strange place, like a carnival or a party. There are lots of people. Tricks are played on me. Some of them have dangerous overtones. Some are just in bad taste. I'm in a crowd. Some man and his son are giving me an award. It's a trick cup. The milk spills out of a hole in the bottom onto the table. The son gives me one of his favorite toys, out of 4. I am with my daughter Dovre. We are on a patio. A maroon cloth thing comes out of a hole in a wall. It's a stuffed woman. Her face is set in fake interest. There is a feeling of danger. I sneak away from her. I'm in the bathroom. A woman walks in to help move things around to make it more convenient for me. However, she fixes it so that the scales are near me and the toilet paper is out of reach. I get up to pull my undies up. They are hard to pull up, like a wet bathing suit. Some men wander through and I walk around, pulling my pants up. Some people are shocked, but I feel, "Ha! Serves 'em right if they are going to be where they aren't supposed to be." At one point, I need to escape. I attempt to fly. I struggle and don't get very high. There are tigers clawing up at me and I just barely stay out of their reach. Then I'm looking for a car to leave in. I'm in a parking lot. I see 2 young women/girls. I think one is Dovre. They are in a beautiful, grey, old time car. They say, "Here, you can take this one." I'm very pleased. I say, "Ooh! I can take topa or topaz? Oh, thank you." I stand on her running board and hug her (the car), and feel privileged.
