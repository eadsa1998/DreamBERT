I was with my sister at the hospital where she took her training. She was on duty and I was going to help her. We were alone in the room with the patient. She was a very tiny old lady. She in a high-sided bed. She was unconscious. I asked my sister what we could do for the woman. She said there was nothing to be done because the woman was just waiting to die. The patient's left arm was paralyzed and had turned green. Her face was drawn and wrinkled. I felt repulsed and frightened.
