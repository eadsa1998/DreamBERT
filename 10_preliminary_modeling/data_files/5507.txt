I went into a huge building, either an old factory or an old mill. The floor was wooden, uneven planks and I was applying for a job and I stood at a counter, an old styled counter that you would see in and old store and filled out many, many papers, applications, I guess they were and then a middle aged, kind of nondescript man said you have to come upstairs and talk to the personnel manager. So we climbed 5 flights of stairs and this was the very top of the building; a very, dirty and dusty and uneven wooden floors and he led me down a long empty room, and there on a wide, wide windowsill, sat my daughter, writing something with a pen and paper. She was sitting in the sunlight and it was shining on her beautiful blond hair, and she turned with a wide smile and said "hi mom! I've been waiting for you."
