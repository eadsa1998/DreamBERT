I was doing computer work, helping couples with things related to their weddings, doing things like labels for invitations and something that seems to be the actual invitation itself. I'm also doing something with emails related to the weddings. I'm thinking that the guests that the couples don't have email addresses for are going to miss out - not receiving the email everyone else will be receiving. I am cutting and pasting or exporting information into email messages - the address and subject boxes - from another software. I can't make it work correctly though, as every time I try it changes the size and such of those boxes and runs them off the page. At first I try resizing each box, then I try other things to keep it from happening. I spend most of the dream trying and retrying this, and getting extremely frustrated.
