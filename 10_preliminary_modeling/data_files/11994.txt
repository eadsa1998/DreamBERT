I had a tank of pet fish in my room. It was quite a big tank and had many varieties of fish, including a seahorse and some little exciting ones. They kept jumping out of the tank and onto the floor, which was annoying. There was a big storm and it was scaring them. I told them something and they got into this big plastic thing, which was a safety defense shield thing. Then I had to guess the code.
