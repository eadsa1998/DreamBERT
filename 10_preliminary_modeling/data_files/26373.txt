 I'm in a coffee shop eating blueberry muffins. The muffins are in the green photograph box I have at home. A few muffins are in a plastic bag in the box. A female employee comes up to me and inquires about my muffins. I tell her I'll draw a black line on the inside of the box or bag that the muffins are in, and I show her my receipt to appease her. I speak firmly and calmly, and am sure of myself. Some people carry signs from high school chemistry about a mol of food. There is one drawing of pizza that looks real. People sit near me. They say something about me eating a mol of food, which may be burgers, fries of pizza. I chuckle at this, knowing it's not something I'm interested in trying to do.
