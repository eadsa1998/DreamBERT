I arrived in a sort of historical park, having come in from a train or perhaps carriage ride.  I looked around in a sort of barn museum.  My parents were around somewhere.  I remember circling the barn, perhaps looking or waiting for them.  At some point later, I was like the rocketeer, I believe it was.  I left the dark wood-paneled office of the lawyer, as if someone had died.  The scenery as I flew like riding an elevated BART train.  Saw an apartment building with half the walls missing.  Somewhat run down, clotheslines hanging.  I passed over a fence into a different sort of beautiful land and met with a woman and a cat.  There was something to do with avoiding being sucked into the sky.
