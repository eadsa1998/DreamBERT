Dream begins when I am home in C--. My mother and I are sitting in the living room. I ask her questions about how and when one of my brothers was killed. I ask her how old I was when the accident happened and she says I was five. I answer by saying then he was twelve and that I should be able to remember what happened. Mother starts to cry, becomes hysterical, and keeps repeating that she could have saved his life if she had taken him to the hospital just one hour sooner. She appears to go completely insane. My father, 53 yrs., comes into the picture and tries to help her but can do nothing.--All at once my mouth is filled with blood and my front teeth begin to fall out--dream ends.
