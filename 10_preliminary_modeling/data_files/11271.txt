I borrowed a book from someone at the co-op whose name I believe was Bernie. Actually I'm not sure of who this Bernie was, but he seemed to be a good friend of mine, and I had a mild superior feeling toward him; that is, I had the feeling that I would always act natural when talking to him, whereas with many of the members of the co-op, I still act somewhat superficial. I was returning the book to this Bernie, and he lived at a two-family house. I rang the upstairs bell, and some male co- op members answered the door. I asked for Bernie, and they told me he lived downstairs. I went downstairs and rang the bell, and when the door opened I found that more co-op fellows were living together downstairs. I was somewhat surprised that they were all living in the same house. I returned the book. I also had the feeling that this Bernie was a small guy of slight build.
