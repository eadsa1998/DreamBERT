I dreamed that I was dying to have sexual intercourse with any woman except my girlfriend. So I remember that I suddenly found myself in a bedroom with a young girl of about 16, very thin, tall and with long hair. I started kissing her neck and then I slowly undressed her, bit by bit. She was too excited with my kisses and asked me to hurry and also to suck her breasts. At this point she could not wait any longer and she spread her legs. But I was still completely dressed and she shouted to me to hurry, but when I saw her so desperate, I slapped her so that she would calm down and she started to hit me with her shoes all over my body with great fury, so much so that I ran out and I saw that she was chasing me, naked, through the streets. I was so desperate that I went into a church and hid in a confession booth. I saw her going into the church and I don't remember more.
