I am sitting on a couch cushion that sits beside the couch. The problem is, the couch is in a large body of water. It is getting soaked through and beginning to sink. I am aware there may be danger in the water, sharks, perhaps. I go to dry land. There is possible war there as well. Now I am going to go to an informal audition. I had shrugged it off at first, not particularity interested in home grown theatrics, but decide to participate, feeling like this is a cinch, I can do this in my sleep. I decide to change clothes. I go into another room where Deirdre, my cousin is. I ask to borrow some clothes. I choose some pink sweater and a skirt. I look at it and realize that it looks a bit tacky and ordinary when I had thought the outfit would look slinky and good. I'm a bit disappointed, but can't see anything better. I wander back slowly, getting distracted. I am a bit arrogant and uppity. Other people are all excited and enthusiastic about the play coming up.
