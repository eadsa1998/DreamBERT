["Continuing a day dream."] The large Frenchman and I go to his house. It is night. We are sexually excited with each other. A warm pleasant feeling. We might make love tonight. He carries me in and we sit, cuddled on the couch. We kiss and slowly the excitement builds. He sweeps me up in his arms and lays me on the floor. We begin to make love when the phone rings. His job duties call. He must leave. He asks me to stay and wait for him to return. H doesn't know how long it will be. I agree. After he leaves, I look around the room very curious about who this mystery man is. I see old fashioned lovely wood furniture. A glass curio cabinet with pretty things in it. I wander around the corner and see a utility room and a kitchen beyond that. I very much want to peek into things but I decide to be honest and don't. I wait many hours. Finally he returns. We love each other. It's going to be wonderful.
