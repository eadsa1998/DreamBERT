I lived in a house with my mother and sister. Outside across the street where the lamppost had been, there was a base with something swinging on it. It resembled a radar mechanism. It had three tops to it where the light on the lamppost had been. I thought maybe the lamppost was swinging, and I was frightened. I was afraid it would break away and hit the house.
