I was excited because I was seeing Whose Line is it Anyway live. Mom dropped me off there late. I went down some steps and sat at the bottom of the stairs. I had a long microphone with me. There was a break now and Colin Mochrie and Ryan Stiles left. I got bored and felt funny about the microphone. I text Mom to get me and got a 'rap' text back and I figured it was from Ezra. I walked out to the carpark. I used the microphone as a cane because my legs were sore. She was already there and I got in. Ezra said that he got Jensen Ackles' "signature" and I was like 'what?!'. He said that this teacher who was obsessed with him told him that he was somewhere. He had a photo and on the back it said "from Jensen" and I said that he should've gotten him to write "love, Jensen". Jared Padalecki was also in the photo. I was annoyed and said that I wanted a photo. Mom was like "you love Sam" and I said "Sam's gay".
