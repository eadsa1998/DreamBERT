I was at this playground place. There were slides, they were waterslides, but they changed to normal slides. A train went around. Ezra went to touch something and this guy told him not to, so he went later. There were climbing poles. Jamison was talking about October Sky. Later, I was staying with Granma and some dude. I went off with someone and we went to the park thing at night time. Then I was running away from something. I went back to the house and they asked me where I had been (it had been 2 days, although for me it had only been a couple of minutes). I said I had been at the park and that night it had rained and something about a spooky guy, but I didn't actually know.
