Somehow I found out that it was the end of the world. I think Zim (Invader Zim) was around as well. I decided to not tell anyone because it was inevitable and not very far away. Some footage of this thing in the sky was leaked and everyone realised. I was with a guy on this cliff and I said I'd taken the footage. There was like 17 seconds left and we counted down, but nothing happened. Some people had killed themselves and I remember Payton shouting something like "I'm a virgin and Lady Gaga sucks!".
