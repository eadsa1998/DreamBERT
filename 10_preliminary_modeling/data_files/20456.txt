I was in a place with my mother and sister. Others were there too. I had some clothing with me. It was damp, so I left it outside on a pile to dry. When I went outside to get the clothing, it had been burned, and there were only ashes left. (I just recalled that last night I dreamed that I left some shirts outside, and it rained. When I returned, the shirts were wet from the rain and full of holes. I wondered if the rain had made the holes.)
