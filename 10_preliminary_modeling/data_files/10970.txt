I dreamed that I was in a classroom about to take an examination. The test was handed out on white printed folded sheets. I unfolded mine and read the single question printed there. I read: trace the importance of erasers on the control of audio-sound frequencies. With a sinking feeling I realized that I knew absolutely nothing about the subject. I seized my pencil with determination and began to do what so many students try to do on exams--bull around, as it's known. I recall writing authoritatively (hoping I could fool the professor). "It will readily be seen by any intelligent person that erasers are of the most extreme importance, etc." I was quite worried that I would be seen through and receive a low grade.
