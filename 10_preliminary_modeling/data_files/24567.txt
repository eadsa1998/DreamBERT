In my dream I thought that dreams were all connected in a puzzle and that my dream of the snakes being run over by a boat was connected to the Disney garden, and they would go together because I would have something terrible happen at the gardens but I would survive it like the snakes. Setting: On my bed. Characters: Me. Feelings and Thoughts: Thinking - that maybe it's true.
