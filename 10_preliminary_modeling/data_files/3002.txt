I'm in a room with a good-looking Rock Hudson like man. He's sort of a guest. I leave him sitting on a chair as I go to find the swim pool. I want to swim, but I see it is empty. The men are working on some power lines or water lines and have turned the water off temporarily, all except the ocean, of course. It is lapping up to the edge of the pool. I see the square metal cage-like thing where the men are working in the shallows of the ocean. Later the water is back in the pool and I think of swimming then, but remember the water needs to stand for awhile to let the bacteria or something leave. Bonnie is there somewhere. I return to my guest. I see a book and start explaining to him that this lists all the different auto dealers and their employees. "For example," I say, "suppose you have a Chevrolet and want to call them to fix your car." I open to that page. I see lists of names. I point to a small list, the first one on the page and say, "...If you want to call an exec, you look him up on this page, but you wouldn't want an exec fixing your Chevy, so look up the mechanics." I see the name Chris D. and ask Jock's daughter if it is any relative to her. Then I say, "Of course not, with the name D., your name is S." I have some errands to run and comment that I saw the interest rate at the bank was lower. He is hurt that I went to the bank and didn't even ask if he could go along. I say, "Well, we can go tomorrow if you like." Then I look at my appointment book. I see I am going to have my car tuned, and the mechanic is named Chris D. What a coincidence. I also have a swim down in the book.
