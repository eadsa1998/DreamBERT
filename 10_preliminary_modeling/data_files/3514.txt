I am talking with Howard about arrangements for the Christmas party. It's a big annual event and I already bought my pretty blue formal gown. Howard says he doesn't know if he wants to go. He'll be busy teaching and can't get there until 10:00 at night. Half the party will be over by then. I sigh. I say, "Oh well, I'm still going." I then am talking to Lucy on the phone. She is sighing and saying she doesn't know if she wants to go to all the work and trouble of going to the party. I am pouring kayo syrup over Rice Krispies and eating it all with a spoon. It is thick and too much syrup, but very, very sweet. I say, "Yeah, I know. I'm not sure why I'm going either. Howard won't be there until late, so I'll be alone. I don't like the people there. They are so correct and so judgmental all the time. I kind of like to do things differently, my own way just to annoy them, but it is tiring hearing their point of view all the time. MAYBE I'll FLIRT WITH THIS CUTE MAN I know. After all I've already got the dress." Then Lucy says, "Maybe I'll stay home and write a book with all my accomplishments and projects all in the book, so at least they'll all be together in one place. It's like Justin doesn't appreciate or even know what all I've done." I say, "Yeah, good idea. My father did that this year. He just wrote up a sort of autobiography of this year's doings and gave it to all of us family. It's kind of neat he's doing that. Guess he's getting old now and does what he wants to do no matter what other people think of it."
