My dream happened in the H. tunnel. I was with another person, a woman; it seems to me it was my mother, but I am not sure. We had to go through the tunnel, but it was closed on both sides by portals. Then we opened one of them and we started to walk and then to run because the bats' screams terrified me. I placed two objects, like books or notebooks, over my ears in order not to hear. I was afraid that they would bite me, especially my legs. At last we got to the other gate, and the person who was with me started to go out walking on her knees. I walked with my feet because the idea of kneeling on that floor was revolting to me. At that point I woke up.
