We were given a number by the church and the #501 was ours. Ann said some of the new parishioners only had to donate $2 a year. We received our envelopes and it came in a wooden box about the size of 12 x 16 x 6. One of the kids got on the express wagon and the man said, "Stick em up." The kid put up his hands and the man said, "No, that is not the danger. We do not do that."
