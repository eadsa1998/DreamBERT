Took place in an office that sold match covers to the specific needs of its customers. They had on display a sample match booklet of the announcer Bud Collier. A customer came into the shop to ask how much it would cost to make up 10 custom matches. The owner got quite mad and told him that he wouldn't just make up 10 matches. <br/
