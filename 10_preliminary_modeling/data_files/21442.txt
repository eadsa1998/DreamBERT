I looked at the paper and saw 334 or 344 just at a glance for bonds. Andy P. was building to his house. He had fresh concrete on a wall and was troweling it out fast before it got hard. I was going to replace some old part of my basement. Ann and I were in the basement. She was laying nude and I was tempted to do it to her, but I resisted her advances. Ann and I were to meet again and I waited for her, but when we met, there was someone around. I had a funny loose and low seat in my car. I was getting ready to drive it. Cousin Helen had a small dog. He did his business on the floor in two rooms and so much you wouldn't think a small dog could do so much.
