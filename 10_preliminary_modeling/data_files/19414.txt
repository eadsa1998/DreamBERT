My mother and her friend Wanda came by to visit me. My mother told me that she had just finished cleaning out her cabinets and that she was going to move. She told me not to tell my sister. I agreed. She asked me to come by and pick up a couple of things that I had left there, so I did. When I arrived, my cousin Erik was in the front yard. He said, "I am going to buy your mom's house and I will sell it to you if you want it. I will finance it for you and when you get out of school, you can buy it." I agreed. I did not want anyone else to have it. I went inside; her house was beautiful. Her doll shelves were decorated better than ever. She was looking through a box of stuff for a wrench and I saw three rings: her mother's ring that I had bought her, her wedding ring, and another ring that she used to wear all the time. I asked her if I could have her wedding ring. She put my name on it and put it back in the box. She said it would be mine.
