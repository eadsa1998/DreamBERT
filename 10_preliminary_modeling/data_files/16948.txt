I'm in some bizarre competition with a very small disabled man. He drives an electric wheelchair or little electric car. He is someone I know, but I can't place who. I might be on a bike. The competition seems to be, who can get into a supermarket car park from the top of a steep hill first. We race. The little man is always accompanied by a female helper (or pertness) who tells him off for racing. I generally get there first (the race is re-run over and over).
