My boyfriend Jeremy complained to me that the nurse had opened whatever it was that he'd bought for me while I was in the hospital.  I was released and in the process of going to the car there was a man who was my father's father-in-law.  My father couldn't look at him.  At the car next to us was a cage with 4 segments, with birds.  I asked a girl what they were, thinking they were guinea pigs.  They were white owls.  Above that was a very large parakeet.  Later the owls were missing, and the parakeet told us something.  We left and the family wanted to stop at a barn store.  There were pigs, and I started to whine about wanting one.  My mother was not understanding and wanted me to get a backpack.
