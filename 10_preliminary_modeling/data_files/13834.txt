I got mail from this Asian girl saying she loved me and we had the same birthday and were both born here, except she lived in the US now. She had found my site. I was confused about it. Her name started with a 'T' and was long and Asian like. Mr Reilly (I assumed it was him) sent me a video of some girl saying "Rawr!". There was a computer, Mom and Darren were on it, I think. My car was just a shell and it was light. I went inside and got a call from some guy called Dennis and he said he was "Brad's Dad". I was wondering why he was calling me and how he got my number.
