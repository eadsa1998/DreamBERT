It happened at a cabin, not mine though. So my parents and my sister were cleaning up and I just went out the door to go outside. It had snowed. Two guys were having a snowball fight and they asked me to join, so I did. I hit one of the guys in the face and he fell backwards. Then I grabbed some more snow and shoved his face with snow while he bent my head down and then I woke up.
