I have some author's original manuscript, written by hand. It is a bulky, loose-paged thing in a folder. I try to get into it, but it is so boring. Finally, I start passing up chunks of the book. I tell Ginny that I have to scan the thing just to find out how it ends, once I've started a book. She laughs gently at me. I decide, what the heck, and go straight to the last two pages. I pick up the manuscript and carry it into the next room where Ernie is seated at a table, desk-like thing, which has rainbow colors on it, and there isn't another thing in the room or on the desk. I put it next to him and joke, "Maybe you want to read it." I go into another room where Ginny brings me a two-book set from a bookstore that she thought I'd be interested in, a sci-fi book, maybe Ursula Le Guin. I open it up and the words sparkle and sort of look like those colorful hologram pictures. They are energetic, colorful, moving pictures only on the words that have that kind of meaning. I like the books and wonder how much they cost. I try to read the cardboard display. Maybe they are $10.20 each.
