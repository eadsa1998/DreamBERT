I went to Canada on a vacation trip. On the way I met this girl and she said she was going to the same place that I was going. Somehow we both started out on this trip around Canada together. We got involved in an argument over the fish in a couple of the lakes and then the boat must have upset because we were both in the water. She seemed to have disappeared in the water. I stayed up on one of those islands always trying to find her but it seems I could never do it.
