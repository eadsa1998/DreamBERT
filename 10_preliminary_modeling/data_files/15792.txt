Mom and I were staying in this hotel in the UK. It looked fancy in the lobby, but the room was a total mess. You had to climb up this ladder to get into the room and it kept flooding with dirty water - so we'd have to climb through the water to get into the room. All the furniture was mismatched and wobbly. Mom would often go out and not leave me with a card, so I'd either get stuck in the hotel with nothing to do or get left outside the room unable to get back in. I went to a cinema with Dad and Ezra and there were no seats, and we were alone, so we sat on the floor at the front. Guardians of the Galaxy was playing, but it was different. Two guys that worked there were having an argument and I think one killed the other. At some point I met Donald Sutherland and had a brief chat with him - mentioning that I'd seen him in an older film that day.
