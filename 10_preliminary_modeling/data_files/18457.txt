There was a cupcake on a stick at a bakery and I asked the guy, "How'd you do that?" And he said, "With a homemade can opener. It cuts around the edges of corks." There was laundry going. Mine, Carlos's and Marianna's. Carlos said, "Watch those clothes!" I said, "I'm watching," but really I had fallen to sleep. The clothes going in circles were hypnotic. I was watching Marianna's clothes because she was very busy. The clothes were dry and I took them out of the dryer. 2 bras. One was black padded with cheap fiberfill. Very Sears and very worn out. The other was clear translucent mesh with black feathers around the top. I meant to try them on but I forgot. Dirty plates and congealed gravy were left on the dining room table. My mother said, "Rudy's just got back from this job interview. Merri, make some gravy with this water. Jesus could turn this gravy into wine." I said, "Red wine on rice is not very good," because I knew they did not have white wine in the New Testament. She said, "Well pretend there's wine in gravy and we'll leave Jesus out of this. There's water in the electric frying pan." Blue on Cheerios boxes had a subliminal message, "BUY ME". Scientific experiments were done at the grocery store to see if more people bought bright electric blue boxes or powder blue boxes of Cheerios more often. Ross was waiting for the bus and she said, "Do you have 3 bucks to lend me for some soda and some water?" I said, "It's almost dark. The bank is closed so I can't get any money." She was pacing back and forth and sighing loudly in frustration. "Can't you go down the hill to the bank and wait there all night for the bank to open? Can you send heavy eyeliner to Russia, and do you have 20 cents for the bus??!! (spoken frantically nervous and fast) I said, "Lighten up" Note: the next day I told Marianna about this dream and she said, "Oh my god, I only had one worn out black bra from K-Mart and Les just got me a new black lace one."
