I am sleeping all night on a closed toilet. It is very uncomfortable. I wake up and I see Gus standing in a far corner of the room, watching.  Marci is asleep on a day bed. She is having a nightmare. She tosses and turns, saying "Ouch," "Don't" She is obviously fending off someone in her dreams. Then she suddenly does a sort of somersault over the end rail of the bed and lands on her face on the floor. It must have hurt, but she doesn't wake up. I am worried about her and also aware this might be proof she was incested. I decide to write down what I saw. I get up. It's time to pack and leave. I walk downstairs. I see Aunt Rosalie in a room. I hesitate and then decide to ask her if she knows Ethan who I now think was the man I saw upstairs. I ask her and she becomes agitated and withdraws, saying no, she doesn't know him and for me to stop bothering her. I follow her out the room saying, Please tell me. I need to know. She doesn't answer. It's time for me to catch the train.
