My mother gave me some christmas cards and other articles to deliver to our neighbors. It seems that some of the cards had been delivered to our house by mistake. I started out and delivered them to the various houses, which were all familiar, but the people didn't seem to be anyone whom I knew. It was snowing out and I remember that I wasn't too happy about the weather. After delivering the last letter or package, I'm not sure which it was, I had a golf club left and no one to take it to. Therefore I began walking toward town; here an automobile pulled up beside me and I began talking to the man, who was no one I recognized, about golf and the activities of the country club. Suddenly the scene shifted and I was on the golf course watching the golfers. It was a happy feeling, no responsibility, and I seemed to be in my element. Then I went up to the club house. The club house seemed fascinating to me, just like It did when I was bout 6 years old, and I enjoyed being around it as if it were some sort of pleasure which I haven't felt for years. Then I went into the club house and my brother was playing the slot machines, which I disapprove of. However, when I entered, he had a great stroke of luck and money (nickels) was coming from every one he played. We filled our pockets and then left.
