I was somewhere doing something with the Technical College. Fletcher came up to me really close and leaned in as if he was going to kiss me and I leaned back to get away. He continued talking to me and I tried to walk back and stand up straight. He kept following me really closely and didn't seem put off by this. But after a while I looked at him properly and he looked like he hadn't slept or had been taking drugs or something. I was glad he was talking to me again but was weirded out.
