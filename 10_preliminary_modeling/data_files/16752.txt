I strip Shelley completely naked, at which point she becomes a baby and I carry her around with me like she's mine. Then I remember Kelley and two others (maybe Josh?) getting ready to walk into a large room filled with people. It seemed like a flea market or something. We were "presenting ourselves" to them or something. We did it a couple of times, walking in together, me right next to Josh. The last time, I wanted to walk in next to Lucy [a prominent teen actress], so I asked them to switch around. I put my arm around her, hers around me, and my head on her shoulder, which would have looked pretty weird (in physical reality, anyway). Then as we're walking in, I realize it's not Lucy, it's someone else (maybe Josh again, I'm not sure) and everyone laughs as if we were a comedy group. Maybe in the same big room, there are sales of various things. I don't remember who the card salesman was, but I think it was someone I knew, and someone, I was told, who really jacked up to unfair prices on his cards. I looked at some comic books on a table a little bit down the way. I wanted to buy something, I eventually was given $40 in travelers' checks from my parents, and I think I found another $100 in my wallet. I was going to buy something, but the next thing I know, I'm in my bed, I open my eyes and look around. It looks just like my physical room, but isn't. The clock says 3:00 or 4:00, which is the time the "flea market" was supposed to end. I'd slept through it, and now my room was empty (upon "waking" into this new dream, I thought the flea market had been in my own bedroom).
