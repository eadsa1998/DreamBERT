My wife Bonita and I were in bed in a room in a dorm at my alma mater.  John and Lois were in town for the weekend, and I wanted us to go visit them.  Bonita didn't think she could spare the time, and wasn't particularly interested in going anyway, so I decided to go by myself.  I felt a bit guilty about going without her, because I knew how possessive she is about weekends, and I tried to figure out how I could spend only part of the time with them and still enjoy it, and be able to spend the rest of it with her.  There was a telephone in our room, but I didn't know the number; so when I had left the building, I thought I should have it, and I threw a little rock up at her window.  When I got her attention and asked her for the number, someone near me replied with the number which must have been the main number for the dorm, but I told him we had a phone in our room.  I vaguely remember several experiences in connection with going to see John and Lois.  In one, Terrence Bailey was going with me.  Still at my alma mater, we went to the dorm for something (in the direction of Clark Hall, actually), and found the whole dorm was gone.  While we were sitting or squatting in front of where the dorm should have been, a whole bunch of soldiers popped up from a line of concealed foxholes, and we were caught in the middle of some kind of battle; I was embarrassed at having been taken by surprise.  We were taken to a temporary building then, where I was supposed to see a major.  While waiting outside his office with others, some of them were looking at my field jacket and trying to figure out my rank.  In one place I still had a single bar, in another the double bar.  I began to worry that I would get in trouble for being out of uniform, even though I was off active duty -- and also self-conscious about having a beard while in uniform.  So I told Doug Sterme (who now takes the place of Terrence Bailey) that we could just sneak away, since they didn't know our names.  <p
