 I'm riding a small bicycle with a gear shifter on the right hand grip of the handlebars. I am going down Oak Avenue in Oak Valley. The road is not in good repair: it is cracked and torn up. I ride near Dan Hellman's house and cross over the railroad tracks there. I may walk across the path, because it is not paved. I am riding up the road towards Bill's Barber Shop. I shift into an easier gear. I am at a house where construction is occurring. I have a front-end-loader on my arms. There is a pile of sand there. A man says they are done with work for today, and to leave the front-end-loader; we'll do more tomorrow. There is a screened in area with a chimpanzee in it. It wants to smoke a cigarette. I light it, but it burns too short. The chimpanzee is going to burn itself, so I slap the cigarette out of its hand and stomp on it. The chimpanzee needs to be locked up. I close the two doors on the porch, and lock the outside door. The inside door needs to be locked too. There is a hole and a latch for the inside door. I encourage the chimpanzee as it tries to lock the door. Then there are two loops that a latch must be inserted through horizontally. Then the two loops are two much larger circles, and the latch is a key, which the chimpanzee puts through the circles. When it tries to latch the smaller loops, the chimpanzee is a Chinese girl. There is a pumpkin nearby. <br/
