["Taunting the dangerous man kills me."] A man has two bat like sticks, one in each hand. He is approaching me menacingly. I am backing up and when I get angry at him for coming at me I lash out and strike at the sticks. I knock one out of his hand. This makes him furious with me. He strikes back at me very hand. I know that every time I defend myself from him it makes his attacks worse, but I just can't help it. I feel cornered, trapped and angry. Finally, I strike at him again and he is murderously livid. He pulls a gun and kills me. It was inevitable. Something about protecting my mother.
