 I'm on the runway of an airport. My brother Wally and others are with me. We see a plane land. It touches down at about midpoint of the runway, which I late, I think. It slows down, but is still going fast, approaching the end of the runway and a fence. It turns sharply to its left, going past us, narrowly avoiding the fence and us. It's a small three-person place. Planes take off to our left. They speed down the runway. I don't know if they will lift off enough to fly over the hills at the end of the runway. One of the planes lifts off and flies up in a loop-de-loop. It's a silver hot rod van with a trailer. There are other cars too that fly up in loops. They are very powerful, can fly straight upwards. I think and feel the difficulty of pulling or straightening out of a car after flying right loop-de-loops in succession.
