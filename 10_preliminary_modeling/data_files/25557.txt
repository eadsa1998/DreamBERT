 I am with some Spanish children who ask me what Double Newla is, in the card game 500. Boat rides are being given, and there is a truck that drives to the boat tours. I am on a boat. There is a war occurring, but a truce is reached. Soldiers swim to each other and hug. The fleets of boats are docile. My friend Kevin Simpson has tortillas with black olives. I'm in a group. A person I know from high school, Gretta Slick, is driving everyone. People are drunk. There are arrows guide a classmate of mine, Bryan Beard, who is in another, lighter craft. A storm occurs. We are out of meat. A turtle is killed for meat. Kevin and I rip it apart with our teeth. It bites me. A man I know from basketball jumps on my roof with big shoes on. (This dream was pretty incoherent.)
