I see a mechanical device that pops up and pokes a person's eyes out. I then see a person walking away with bloodied eyeballs. I think to myself, "I can't believe I watched that. Now I'll be stuck with that horrible image in my head." Now I'm standing precariously on a small wooden platform just outside an open hatch or door on a boat. The waters (ocean) are cold, stormy and foreboding. A man stands with me and he points to the water and says that he is willing to jump in that dangerously cold water to save me if he has to. I feel unwilling to do that for him and devoutly hope I don't fall in. I back away toward the boat.
