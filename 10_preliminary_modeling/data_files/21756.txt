I saw Henry Seegert. He had quite a beard about 1 week's growth. He was jolly and talking to someone. I drove down to Carl Fisher's house to go to work with him. When I got there, he was still sleeping. I said, "What time is it?" and Mrs. Fisher didn't know. I asked to use her phone and to my surprise there was no numbers or letters on her phone dial. It was loose, kind of stuck with glue. A lady came out of the front room and then another one. They didn't say anything, but one of them came up to me and kissed me and I did so in return. She surprised me. Then Carl got up came into the kitchen in his sorts. I was surprised how big he was and how husky his hips and legs were. I didn't know he was so husky. I drove and there was snow on the streets. We were by our garage and I saw a big bug flying towards me. I had a fly swatter so I swung it in his direction. He flew up on the electric wires. I got a stick and tossed it up at him as it came close to him he got hold of the stick, sat on it and came down with it. He was a very big bug. I started to hit him with the fly swatter. He was very touch. He turned towards me to fight. He had a hard, crusty body and a big mouth. As I was hitting him, small bugs seemed to come off him and they were crawling towards me, so I swatted them. Then the big grub and the small ones stopped crawling and were dead. I looked at them and said, "How did this bug fly around when it is so cold and snow on the ground?"
