Dad still lived at the old house. I had stayed there and for some reason I was going to run out when he wasn't looking. I ran to my car and unlocked it, but accidentally locked it and then did it again. I climbed through the passenger side. He came out like 'what are you doing, I made you sandwiches' and I said 'oh, can I have them?'. He brought them out. He posted a thing later saying "absolutely a big deal" about when Jayne (Firefly) had thrown a game. There was a card for Mal, someone else and one of me and Simon? Mom drove to this place and parked on the side of the road. They sold silk, though it was actually squares of some other material. We picked up some kids? The eel was in the boot (it was like a hatchback) and floating around. We dropped the kids off and went home, but it was different. It had no doors and we had to slide these wooden things around. We had heaps of old people over. We went to dads and closed off the doors of car and let the eel out and ran inside. I asked Mom if he was inside yet, then we saw him float in. I was in the dining room. I ran down the hallway into my room. I remembered my computer wasn't there and ran into Dad's room instead. The eel came down the hallway, chasing me, and I closed the door.
