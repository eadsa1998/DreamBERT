Andy's brother Tom was shooting his rifle at about 1 mile distance with a telescope. there were three of us about a mile away and the shots all were falling about six feet in front of us. I said it was a good shooting. I picked up some of the lead pellets, they were split. Andy Palider was to drive some colored boy or fellow back and forth to work. He signed a contract to do to.
