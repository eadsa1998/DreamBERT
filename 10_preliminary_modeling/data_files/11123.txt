I was on the stage trying out for a part or I had the part. Many people were on the stage walking off and on. Confusion was present. Next I was in a room trying to find clothes to put on. I had one outfit on but found a brand new skirt so I put the new skirt on with a blouse. I had two sorority pins on. One was plain gold and the other had pearls. I asked a friend in the room if I cold wear them and she said yes, so everyone would know I was in a sorority. I then took off he plain pin, but kept the pearl pin on. At the end I was back on the stage with an audience, but not doing anything.
