Charla and I are at the TV station very early in the morning. I am very tired. We are told to wait in a studio which has lots of furniture and boxes. We wait hours, it seems. Charla leaves the room and I go after her. I talk with a secretary about when it's our turn to be on television. We had been asked to be there to be on a show. Now the staff comes in and it is breakfast time. One man says oh, left over fudge. I am spooning refried beans and a piece of chicken in a bowl for me.
