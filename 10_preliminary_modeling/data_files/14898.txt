I was outside with Samantha and Calvin at school. He told her to run around this area and me to just stand there. It was an experiment that he was filming. He ran to the top of the oval and Samantha was still here and said if he did something for 10 minutes straight, he would collapse. We went up the hill and there was a crowd of people. He was mumbling nonsense and they were trying to give him water. I was holding a Sakata. Eugene came and saw my Sakata. I was trying not to look at him and it seemed as though he was waiting for me to look. I went to class. Mom pulled out old school stuff of mine. There was a game I made in year 6 and it was like a mad lib but you just filled in the last word. She tried to explain it but she didn't make sense. I told her to give up. There were Goosebumps books. I said "Beast From the East for the win!". There was a presentation about some computer thing.
