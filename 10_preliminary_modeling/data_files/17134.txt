I was in a bus station.  The people made me nervous.  I was going to use my phone to call my mother, but I was going blind and could only see on the periphery.  I panicked, especially because of the crowd around.  I was at a college created by two guys.  I was sitting at a computer terminal chatting to 'Leon'.  Several times I went back to the terminal to find I needed to log off again.  There were electric toothbrushes for each person's sign-on.  At one point I went to the college radio station room.  People were not that friendly, though.  I talked to a girl nearby at a terminal when I went back to sign off the computer again.  Leon was my online friend Marty.  I told the girl I was meeting him on Sunday.  She was the only nice person I encountered.  I think I was on a sit-in tour of the school, but I had to do the homework.  There were two girls with powers.  My brother Stuart's old history teacher Mr. Sanders came in.  My math teacher Mr. Johnson was there too.  One of the evil girls was angered by Mr. Sanders for some reason, and caused him to have a heart attack.  He was able to get his shirt off and lay down.  I wanted to help, and he laid his head on my knees.  He turned red, and was in great pain.  I placed my hand over his heart, and it felt like it was trying to punch its way out of his chest.  He flinched and fluttered his eyes, and he was dead.  I tried to get away before his heart could truly surface.  I got up anxiously with tears in my eyes and a quick brush of my hand across his face to close his eyes as I stepped away.
