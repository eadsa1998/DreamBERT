The dream involved these people tearing this house down. It seems they were going to tear it down to rebuild it across the road. It didn't make a whole lot of sense. They were starting it in a very odd way. They were tearing down the foundation first and leaving most of the house still standing up. It would seem to be a rather dangerous procedure because the rest of the house, pieces of it would collapse and onto them. I and this girl and this big Negro man were most concerned with getting the house torn down. A whole lot of people had come out presumably to help. It seemed like sort of an old-fashioned thing with everyone pitching in, all your friends and neighbors to help you put up a house or something. These people were all friends and neighbors of whoever this house belonged to. It was Sunday afternoon and they all brought all sorts of fruit and everything. They were just sitting there having a big picnic while we were trying to get the house torn down, and I didn't think it was right that they wouldn't help. We were trying to get them to do so, but they wouldn't do it.
