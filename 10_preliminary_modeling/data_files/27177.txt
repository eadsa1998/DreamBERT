I was out in front of my house waiting for someone, and it was at night - Down the street there was a group of singers standing singing songs. I decided to see if I could join them. When I got to the group I found that they were my aunts and uncles and cousins. I asked them to all come in and have something to eat - They agreed but when I started back up the street with them, we kept walking and walking - there were no houses at all - All I could see when I looked around for my house were stores, Finally they started to go into one of the stores - and I kept telling them that this wasn't my house. They only laughed at me - then inside the store it actually was the inside of my house - and my family were all there. When I began to sing with everyone I woke up.
