Jimi Hendrix is going to put on a live performance to a small room of special guests - only about a dozen people - including me. We all wait in a white modern room with theatre-style seating at one end. A Marshall amp has been set up at the other end. One of the other guests complains that I have sat in his seat. "How is it your seat?" I enquire. He claims he "always sits there". He's a fan club guy. The other people in the room seem to think he's important in the Jimi Hendrix community. I give in and give up my seat. Hendrix finally enters the room and shyly plugs in his guitar and proceeds to play.
