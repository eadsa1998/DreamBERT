 I'm in an academic building going to a classroom. I see the woman from my Cellular/Molecular Biology class, who is always promoting her homosexual/bisexual professor's views, at or in one of the elevators. I go into a second elevator. It drops fast, and I float off the floor and hover at the ceiling because we descend so fast. I walk to a huge auditorium that is divided into sections, which are classrooms. I go to room 105. There is a class there taking place. I sit at the side. There is a large movie screen with an introductory/informational movie playing. I know when my class meets in 10 or 15 minutes, we'll see the same movie. The male professor is Asian. He is absentminded, and doesn't think in the same time frame that other professors do. He is like Apu from the television show the Simpsons, or my anthropology professor Harold Gunther. He doesn't plan ahead, but deals curtly with problems as they arise.
