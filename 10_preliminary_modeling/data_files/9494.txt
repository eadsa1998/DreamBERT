Two large purple &amp; white baskets arrive from Israel; We are lowered into ground: read scriptures; see ocean swell, like tidal wave; water rushes in over everything; Then I go closer to see and it fizzles out; then walk with "long lost boy friend" -- D.H. or J.L. very happy. We talk about Van Gogh drive home with his parents and his father fondles my knee.
