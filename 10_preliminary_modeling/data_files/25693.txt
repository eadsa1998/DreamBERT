 I'm in a car with my roommate Stephen Ramos. We're on Superhighway 100 near the town of Crystal. There are several police cars in the area and traffic is backed up. People are pulling over to the side of the road. There are more flashing lights on cars. We stop. There is a man right in front of our car. Stephen is driving. Four or five men start beating our car! They dump things in the car, soiling it. I'm afraid they're going to blow the car up. They are working for their boss, who is a mobster. I get mad and want to beat up the leader of this group. I do beat him up, and then run down many flights of stairs, jumping and scrambling away. I go through doors and down more stairwells. There are many doors. I go through some doors, which lead to more doors or elevators. There are many possible ways I can go. I hope I can lose the people following me.
