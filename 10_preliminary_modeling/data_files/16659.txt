I was taking a math class again. I don't know why this keeps coming back to me. But for some crazy reason it was like a catechism almost, and I was filling out a PBS online that was the homework. It was a worksheet all about Easter and stuff. And it was asking questions about the Easter story. And one of them that I can remember is, "Do you think that the spirit __________" or something like that. And then last night I had a dream that I was going to sing __________ play a clarinet or something. And the only scene that I remember was that I was sitting at a school desk, studying a musical score and trying to write __________________. And I was thinking how I didn't know much about how to play the instrument and how to _______________ to make the notes ________________, but for this to come out of the music and sing it and the teacher will think ____________________. ___________________.
