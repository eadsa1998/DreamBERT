Now I'm outside a smaller house at the beach. I see the tide is rising and waves are breaking over the rock barrier. If I don't move, I'll get wet and the waves look quite large. I could get hurt as well. As the first waves are actually sloshing around my feet, I beat a hasty retreat to the house. As I get there, I see its foundation is solid, huge rock boulders. I am impressed and feel safe. I go in. I see small refrigerators in the kitchen, up on the counter, and am glad because that's easier for me to manage, like the house is made with my disability in mind.
