This seems to be just a fragment. I'm like in the Navy and I think in a chow line. There's a purveying feeling here of something very new and all-encompassing. It reminds me of the feeling I had when I went in the Navy. It's like there are two kinds of people, or two classes, or two ranks. Let's say it's ranks. I've been promoted for a transfer from one to the other, and I was standing in line here, in the chow line, and this member of this new group that I'm moving into is standing there, and we're joking and talking, sort of getting ready to make friends. Meanwhile there's an old friend of mine from the other group who is up ahead and has already gone through the line and is sitting eating at the corner of one of the tables. Apparently he and I have made some kind of plans previously to eat together if it can be worked out. I'm somewhat at odds with myself. I don't quite know what is to be expected in this kind of a situation. I'm sort of caught between both of them and their expectations. Just before I was awakened, I had just decided to try to satisfy both sides by just walking down a few tables with my tray and setting it down next to this old friend of mine and saying to the new friend something like, trying to figure out what to say either making this look like it's chance, a chance meeting or saying something about having a previous appointment. This whole thing reminds me of junior high school days in the seventh grade when Frank _____ and John Tihanic and I were just making fast friends of each other, and John Tihanic was kind of the, everybody's favorite. He must often have felt the way I did in the dream. One other thing associated with this dream, either in it or certainly as I was trying to remember it, this came in. Again it was the sign for inclusiveness in the scoring system M3 and the sign for female.
