I was standing in a large open space with nothing surrounding me but a large stone wall on one side. I recall that there were some people mingling around but who they were I don't know. Then I walked over to the wall and sat down. I began to eat a sandwich and it seemed that I kept eating and eating on that same one. A person was sitting next to me, a man that I know only casually, and I remember we were talking about how silly the other people were to get in line. By this time various people had gotten in line right in front of us. I remember we were sitting cross legged and that the sun was very hot. The next thing I remember was standing in line myself. I had that awful feeling that I was going to fall down any minute. At this moment I became conscious of a long glass paneling affair surrounding everyone. Through the glass I could see nothing but space, and the next thing I knew I was falling through space and I woke up.
