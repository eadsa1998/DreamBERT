We were at Nana's. Mom was there too. There was food including vegemite toast and peanut butter toast. We were taking the ones that hadn't been touched. Ezra asked Poppers for money. Mom was doing my hair so I couldn't get up to him to get the money. There was a dog outside and I said "Fido! You're not Fido!". Poppa, Nana and Uncle Wilbur had a feast out there. We all sat down and ate.
