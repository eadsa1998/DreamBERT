I am on vacation with an unidentified girlfriend at "Disney World", which is really a large skyscraper with many trick staircases, secret passageways, etc. I spy X. (a male friend from college) arriving behind me and we move on. I am hiding from him and eventually escape. I stay one step ahead through the staircases and hide, even as another college friend is sent ahead to "see if I'm there, and to get me to join them." I am clever and successful at hiding, but I can not recall the reason for doing so.
