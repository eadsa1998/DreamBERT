I dreamed that we were having Martin Luther King Jr. Day in a huge stadium, like Madison Square Garden. One of our all school sessions had just finished, so we were all leaving. I saw Jackson and we did our little smiling thing. I made the sign that I would call him. So then I was doing laundry in the mailroom and I ran out of quarters. I finally found some and put them in the slot. I remember being very confused as to how to do my laundry. Then we had to go back to the auditorium and all watch a movie. It was the freshmen class doing a skit about how much they hated Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Weird...then there was this woman who looked like Mary Poppins. She had a butterfly costume on and was asking this man in the audience to marry her. He said he would do anything but marry her. Then she flew off with the rest of the butterflies. Then someone shot her down. A boy ran to her fallen body and opened up her wings. They were beautiful. I took them and left the auditorium away from everyone else. A little girl ran up behind me and tried to take the wings. They ripped a little bit, but I gave them to her. I was yelled at for this. I went to shower and realized that one of my shoes was gone. I went to the locker room and looked for it. But it wasn't there. So I never found it, but I remember seeing the boys going to soccer practice.
