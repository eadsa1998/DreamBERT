 I'm in Chinatown. It is an area of large pyramid-like structures with stairs on them. I ride a disc sled down one side of these structures. This is inappropriate in the Chinese culture. My friend Norman Noman is there. I am on roller blades and I illegally throw a three-inch by three-inch beanbag into a place. I want it back. A high school classmate of mine, Brent Jumper, has the beanbag in a toilet.
