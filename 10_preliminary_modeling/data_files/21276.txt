I was talking with Tony from Jake's Tavern. He was a graduate from a dairy college. He said he knew a fellow who took the course and it cost him $450. Then I was in the dairy. I lay by the different change processing and had a teaspoon. I was sipping up the milk and the flavor was getting better at each process. Mary Hugh, a schoolmate of mine in my youth, was walking by. I moved my head towards her and she brushed my hair with her legs as she walked by. A rowdy who was working the dairy offered the girls milk as samples, made her carry hers up a flight of stairs. I went up the stairs to the top and then started back down and she was still going up. I looked back and up and I noticed the rowdy and Mary were gone and a door to the right was open, the only place they could have gone. I had an idea, he pushed her in the small compartment thru the only door and did her dirt. I went on down into the dairy and a short while later Mary and the rowdy were coming into the dairy and she had tears in her eyes. He had forced her to his will. We were on a trip in PA. We were by Gotches and had a room to sleep for the night but changed our minds to start home by car. I looked into the bedroom and a strong breeze was blowing thru. Then we were by Grandma's and it was also in Rivertown. She made a nice ham. I looked at the thick slices right near me. It was lean, fried and red. I was walking to leave and I spotted Grandpa Evans walking between a couple fellows. He seemed to be spry and healthy. We had some money in a party that we threw. The amount was in the hundreds. I think the balance was to go to me if there was any and there seemed to be a nice balance.
