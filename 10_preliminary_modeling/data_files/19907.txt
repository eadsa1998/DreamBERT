I was on my way to visit someone with my mother. We passed a street named Main, on which we had once lived. My mother asked me if I remembered how I used to come there when I was a little boy. I said I remembered taking a short trip, and sometimes a long trip to the county. We arrived at the house. A stout woman and a good-looking daughter were there. The mother was helping the daughter to get dressed. My mother said that if it weren't for the daughter, we would not have come. Then they sat down with the father to eat.
