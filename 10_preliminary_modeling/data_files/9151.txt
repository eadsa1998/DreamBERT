I was doing SAID work at the computer for an event other than conference. I went to a store to do some shopping. I was looking for candleholders in the right shade of purple that would match something someone else was doing for the event. I happened to see that person at the store so I picked up a purple candleholder and took it over to her to get her opinion as to how good of a match it was. She wasn't sure. There were large and long rectangular pieces of fabric hanging from the ceiling. They were a rainbow of colors, including two shades of purple hanging next to each other. I pointed to them and asked her if she could tell if one of those was the right shade. She said the lighter one, which was lavender. I didn't think that was right but said okay and went and got two lavender candleholders. The first two that I had picked up were about four or six inches in diameter and about three inches deep. The lavender ones were square with slightly rounded corners. They were about 2 inch square. Even though I didn't think they were the right color, based on what I remembered seeing, I picked up two of them. I was walking through the store to look for some other things and I saw the other woman again talking to someone. I waited until she was free and then walked up to her and told her I just wanted to make sure I had the right shade.
