The other night I dreamed that I was on summer vacation my friends. We went golfing, to the beach, to restaurants and parties. We spent the days laying on the beach and swimming while we spent the nights drinking and dancing with girls we met there. I woke up right before going to the beach late at night with one of the girls I met.
