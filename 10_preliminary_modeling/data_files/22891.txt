I was in my hometown, at the front of a supermarket, and saw Phyllis Rogers coming through a checkout line.  She was as pudgy as ever, maybe more so.  She was surprised to see me, though apparently not overjoyed, considering how she had once felt about me.  I walked up to her to greet her and gave her a friendly kiss.  She seemed shocked by this, which surprised me, since she had been the first girl ever to kiss me on the lips.   As I left the supermarket, one of the checkers was coming in the door, and it was either Kendall or Charles Waller.  I gave him a friendly thump on the shoulder or chest and said "Remember me?"  I said this because I wasn't sure whether it was Kendall or Charles, since they looked alike and it has been quite a few years since I have seen Charles; I had no doubt that Kendall would remember me.  It was Kendall, and he did remember me-but he wasn't overjoyed to see me either, which really puzzled me.  He walked to the nearest check stand and went right to work, talking to me as he worked.  I then noticed Charles sacking groceries at the next check stand.  Kendall said his father had just died-the day before, I think.  I was shocked, and realized then why he was so somber rather than his usual effusive self.  His hair, eyebrows, and eyelashes were a very sandy color -- more like Albert Fink than like Kendall -- and his eyelashes each seemed separate and distinct; I remember staring at them and at his face.  There was something about his complexion too, that intrigued and somewhat disconcerted me.
