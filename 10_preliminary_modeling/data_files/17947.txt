I was in a small library at a college, looking at a scientific book.  As it happened, the author, a professor at the college, came in and saw me looking at the book.  There were two concepts I didn't understand and I wanted to ask him about them, but he was busy and I would have to sit off to the side and wait for a bit.  I walked into a small store and several of my former teachers were there.  My 3rd/4th grade teacher Mrs. Drager was talking to someone, explaining how she grew a moustache to see how people would react.  It was a big bushy Tom Selleck type moustache.  She and the person she was talking to both had what looked like some sort of face paint around their nose and eyes..mostly green with some red and blue, though it was paler on the person she was talking to.  Though there was another teacher off to the side I wanted to talk to, they looked somewhat more occupied, so I didn't want to disturb them, and I thought I'd do the opposite of what Mrs. Drager would expect in having the moustache, meaning talking to her first.  I walked up to her, hugged her, and uncharacteristically gave her a kiss on the cheek.  She wasn't pleasantly surprised by this as I'd expected, and told me I shouldn't have done that- that the odd colors on her face were symptoms of some illness she had, and that by kissing her I would be sick now too.
