Father Andrew gives me a job to help him: I do all sorts of small secretarial jobs and special assignments; I go to the library to pull out references, books and paintings; I get out 2 new ones; it's a very lovely library, with sculptures, and hangings, I say: This is exactly the job I want." ++Very happy; walk through the library to a market to buy a red apple and go home.
