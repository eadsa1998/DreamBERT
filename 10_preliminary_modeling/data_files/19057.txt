Something about a Lowell Brothers truck. I'm with some younger fellow. He seems to be some kind of an athlete. I think of Chris Heinicke. He seems to be also from a foreign country. He's interviewing people in this country. I don't think, and then the next thing I know we're out on a street having a catch with an orange. I'm throwing it very, very high and way up and he's catching it. Then he throws it back. It goes on that way for some time. Then all this turns into Howie Blane and I at his apartment or at his house. It's in the afternoon. We're having a drink together and he says something like it's been a great pleasure for a change to get together alone so that we can be intimate. Then he has to rush off and see a patient. Then I'm in the bathroom of the house wondering when Eleanor will get home, that's Howie's wife. There's something hanging about the bathroom like a project of some kind either Eleanor or Howie has been snipping certain kinds of old comic strips out and it looks like they're putting them together for some reason. They do have those kind of projects going on all the time. I think there may be some thoughts of masturbation floating around in there. In the earlier part with this Chris Heinicke type of guy, it's as though I'm some kind of consultant. I really didn't feel like much of an expert in what he was interested in, but he seemed very happy to get what I had to say. When we were playing catch with that orange, I was pleasantly surprised to realize that I could still throw it a high as it turned out I could, but I was a little worried that I might try to exceed my strength and throw my shoulder out.
