Hal Sparks was at a counter in a lobby. These two girls came up to him. One had short brown hair and she said that she was willing to "sleep her way to the top. I want a room on the top floor". Hal yelled at her and this big muscly dude said something about Hal being a man. I was laughing. Later, some guy took a girl and said they could have her back for $400. Then I was with Calvin and I said that Samantha wasn't coming because I traded her for someone. He said "Who? Eugene?" Then Lana Lang (Smallville) was there.
