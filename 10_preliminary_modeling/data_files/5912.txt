I am with someone, not a stranger, but apparently someone with whom I work, and we are standing in the street at night and looking at up a new, large office building. it is immense and has maybe fifty windows along one side of a floor. Only a few lights show, and here and there one sees a secretary working. I distinctly note one blonde with a reddish blouse at a brightly lit window, typing. Someone makes a remark about the girls having always to work late, although the boss has gone home. Later I am in a suite of offices apparently soon to be occupied by my own firm. Most of the floors are still empty of furniture. I am standing in a shadow next to a closet inside one of the offices and am dressed in a blue seersucker skirt and jacket. The main door down the hall opens and in comes a firm official and with a guy I know. They walk away and I am relieved ... but then the guy turns and says he wants to see what his new office looks like. I then realize as he heads towards my direction that maybe I am in that office. I quickly tear down the skirt and fumble for my trousers. Then his steps pass the office and I realize that he won't see me. He and his boss are also wearing seersucker men's summer suits of same bluish color as my women's suit.
