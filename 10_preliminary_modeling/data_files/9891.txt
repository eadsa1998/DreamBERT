Frank and I are at Mary Po.'s house, from Church. I had loaned her a typewriter. Father Andrew, wearing dark clothes comes in and talks to her daughter. He sees me typing away: "What are you doing here?" I tell him we loaned her a typewriter and Frank appears. Father Andrew smiles and is friendly as Frank packs up. Frank does not talk to Father Andrew, but Father Andrew and I walk out together and I explain, and he explains, and we laugh. Very close. I see through to a place where I had been before while riding a train.
