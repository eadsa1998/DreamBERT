I work for some TV company or something. I am working on my dreams. Carlene of Merton Circle comes over to see how I'm doing. I explain to her that lots of people say I'm obsessing on working on my dreams, and maybe they are right, but I just have to do it. She sympathizes and says she's working for hours at a time on a computer program. She understands. I am now opening envelopes and finding 10 dollars in cash in them. People are finally sending me some grudging support for my birthday, or for my dreams project. Some arrogant man isn't working out for the company. Someone measures the love a man has for me and Dwight's love for me. Dwight's love is stronger.
