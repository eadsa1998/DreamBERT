I was playing tennis and I felt very tired. My friend Robin was playing badly and I got upset because I had to spend my time picking up lost balls. I wore a tennis uniform, which is white, and then I saw myself in a long, red, gauzy dress, and I was dancing in a room I had not seen before. And I went round and round, so much so that I felt I was falling into a deep void and my fall never stopped.
