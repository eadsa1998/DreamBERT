I go to a man's house. It's a mess: dishes in the sink, beer bottles and full ashtrays on the dining room table. I start to wash the dishes. He comes home from work. He is tired and not very handsome. He is upset with me for interfering. I apologize and agree not to do any cleaning. So I ask him for the computer information I came for. He goes to his computer and I look out the window while I wait. I see lots of trees and I think they are very pretty. I notice one tree in particular. I think, "Why it's a mandala, the way the leaves form a lovely circle," (like an umbrella tree). Then another tree has leaves shaped like shovels (work crane shovels). The mandala tree has leaves shaped like birds of paradise. A woman comes to the window to talk to the man. She'd been picking berries in the field across the road. She invites him to a dance. He shrugs. She says, "Don't you want to meet eligible women?" He agrees. I feel a little left out and think, "Well, what about me? Aren't I eligible?" I have a feeling he and I are going to get together lovingly.
