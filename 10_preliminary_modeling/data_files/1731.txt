I am being given a pretty, white Persian kitten for doing some errand or favor. I feel mildly guilty for needing a reward for doing something nice. I realize I have to go collect the kitten. I was only given an example of what she looks like. Some pages I need are missing. I look for them and remember I'd put them in another book. I feel frustrated.
