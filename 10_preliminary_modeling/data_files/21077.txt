I looked at my leg and saw a blood clot in an artery start to move in the artery. I watched it move. At first I thought it was a good idea for it to free up and clear out of my system, but then I thought of it going to my heart and clogging it. The clot went moving. It came to a bend in the artery and it stopped there. My brother Steve got into an airplane and flew around. A blood clot was passing thru my arteries. I could see it move a lump.
