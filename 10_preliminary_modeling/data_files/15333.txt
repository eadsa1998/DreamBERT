Darren went to the vet and they charged $225. He was short a few dollars and thought they were lying. Mom also commented on it. I was at university and I had to learn French or German. I don't know where I was but I went to the toilet. I could see the shadow of a person under the door and it was Calvin. I went out and he was talking and joking and a weird troll creature came in. I screamed and it attacked Calvin and I shut the door and locked it. Not all the doors were locked and more came. I ran down and Elijah had a pole and I grabbed one and we flung them away. We ran to the end of the room and there were more sharp, pointy things. There were two others with us and we put ourselves into a circle. There were eight of them. He said each person would get two shots. I was in a room and Darius was there. There was nothing outside, just a blue sky. He said "that's me!" and I saw a dog on the bed and I said "hi doggy" and we quoted The Room.
