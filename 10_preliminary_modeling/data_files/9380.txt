Parents 'come to life' out of the grave, despite having been cremated. Father looks the same and mother tries to run my life again. They don't seem astonished. I understand that Forest Lawn is being sued for burying them alive! Shift: I walk along a ramp with A.S. (University instructor) and think of him as my therapist. He says, "In two years mother's cancer could have been cured," but he can't explain it. He is very understanding. At home mother sees a daughter born after mother's death and she says: "So that is what you have been up to." Much commotion and people. Feeling of incredulity; how could it have happened? But no guilt.
