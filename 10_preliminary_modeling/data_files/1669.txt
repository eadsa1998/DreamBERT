I go into a room, a bedroom, and find some cousins there that I didn't know very well. His name is Russ and he's sleeping on the floor by the bed, between the bed and the wall, wrapped in a blanket. His wife greets me and we hug and talk. Then we are sitting next to a car. Russ and I are seated so close I'm practically in his lap. I become aware that that is too intimate, so I get in the car (VW). I say, "Who is going to drive, you or me?" He doesn't care, so I decide to drive and get in the driver's seat. Then I see that a group of rowdies has him and they are walking down the road. I want to save him and get him away from the influences of this gang.
