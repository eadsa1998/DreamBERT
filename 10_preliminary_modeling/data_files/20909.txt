A man commented about my sleeping unclad. He asked if I were effeminate. I was lying in the bed with my pajamas on the floor. I told him I was accustomed to sleeping in underwear rather than pajamas. Later I was recording and synchronizing something, preparing for a stage play. I was in a large building with passageways.
