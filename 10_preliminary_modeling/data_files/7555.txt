I'm in this room or house very busily removing pictures off the wall, which I will replace with other pictures. I have the replacement pictures hidden about the room (house?) behind, or under, various pieces of furniture. I'm in a hurry because I'm expecting Mary to return at any moment and I want to surprise her with my new rearrangements. I'm sure she's going to like the changes. Adam is somewhere in the room (house) helping me. Then I go to the door, open it, and Mary is there. I'm delighted to see her. She looks older, but her hair is still very dark and she's wearing it in the upswept style. I gather her in my arms and want to kiss her, but I'm not sure how to kiss her because she's been away so long. Should it be a kind of "on the cheek" kiss, or should I give her a passionate "on the lips" kiss? I do both. First on the cheeks, then on the lips. But she pushes me away when I kiss her on the lips, and laughing, says she has a cold and doesn't want me to catch it. She's very tactful in her approach and I don't feel any resentment. I'm happy she's home. I escort her inside to show off the changes. I have to take the pictures out of hiding to show them to her and I'm happy that she's pleased with the changes I've made.
