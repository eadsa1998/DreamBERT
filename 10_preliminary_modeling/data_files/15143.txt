I was at a pet shop with Mom. There were kittens and there was an orange one (a girl) who looked like Spaceman in a basket with others and it rubbed its chin against the edge of the basket. I was thinking we could breed them, but they were both fixed. The girl at the counter said something to put us down (like, that they were easy to breed), and that she had cows. We were at a beach later and there was a guy in the water with a big cow. A lady was there with her creepy son. I think he may have been retarded as well. As I got out of the car I said "I just don't think dead people care what we wear to a funeral". We got a new house, which was almost the same as the old one but slightly different. Darren and Mom were there. I had no pants on. I asked Darren where the toilet was and he didn't know. A lady made a peanut butter sandwich and then threw it in the bin as I made one. Then she cooked muffins on the stove. Later, I was with Jason Segel, though I think he was Nick (Freaks and Geeks) and he was at a school. We were walking outside and walked around the back of a building and he kissed me against the wall and I fainted? I was thinking that this had happened to Lindsay (Freaks and Geeks) in an episode once.
