I'm driving an old car, my '61 Comet. There are lots of lanes, a freeway. Then there's snow on the ground and I'm on a dirt road. In the snow, I skid and lose control. I realize as I pumped the brakes that I have no control, so I just sit there and steer to a soft as possible "crash" into a bank. I sit there, wondering what I'll do now! A huge dog bounds up and is wagging his tail. I get out to look over the situation. I see I have a flat tire, the left rear tire. I think, "Huh! Another one!" I open the trunk and look in, sleeping bags, wires, and junk. I'm thinking, "Yuck." I'm standing in muddy puddles, and I can't find a tire repair, or spare tire. This is not comfortable. I look around to see if anyone's around that can help me. Then I'm aware that the car is going to blow up. I run for cover. A man is running with me. I run into his house. The car explodes. I wonder, "Now what?!" The man is delighted to meet me. He's heard about me and has wanted to meet me for awhile. I decide to go on. He says to be sure and get acquainted with the natives. That will be good for me. My 2 cats hop up on my shoulders and ride with me. The man is impressed. I see slug-like creatures in his hallway. They repulse me. I ask if they are dangerous. "What are they?" I step on one accidently and it pops. "Ugh." As I leave, I become aware that the man is very pleasant and I would probably enjoy knowing him. I wonder why I'm leaving.
