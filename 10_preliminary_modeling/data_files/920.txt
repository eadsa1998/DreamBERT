There is some danger. A woman friend or relative has turned against me. I must lock the door against her and run. An old house. A man is with her. There is a sign on the floor. It's the word "bear" and represents a pet dog of co-worker Tyler's. He's not allowed to keep it. I feel sad for him. There is a deep, deep hole where the pet is.
