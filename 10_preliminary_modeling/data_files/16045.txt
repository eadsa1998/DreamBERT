Mom and I were cleaning upstairs in our rooms, and that we had an agreement that the first half hour she would put her boom box on and be the DJ, and the second half hour I would put my boom box on and be the DJ. But during her half hour I closed my door, and I wanted so bad to investigate this doll. It was supposed to be this like really super Gidget Gadget paper game. And she was just like a Christmas angel, only she didn't have wings and she didn't move, and stood on a base. And she was a singing doll and she had a volume knob on her base. And somehow I turned it up and I couldn't turn it down, and I was trying to work her gidgets and gadgets, and I couldn't really, I was just, my hands were like stiff as stone. And then all of a sudden I was juxtaposed out into like a rural farm area and I saw these three chickens living in small cages, living in absolute filth. And we bought them just so that we could set them free, and then I woke up.
