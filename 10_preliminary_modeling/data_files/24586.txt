I was at the Gap and I saw my friend. She told me about the camping trip our class was going on, which I knew nothing about. I took the bus there anyway, and the counselors wouldn't tell me what group I was in, because I wasn't signed up. Then I called my mom and she came and signed the permission slip. Then I was put in a group. Setting: At Gap and at a camp. Characters: Me, my friend, my mom, the counselor. Feelings and Thoughts: Worried, disappointed. When my class went camping in the fall, I had to stay in the hospital that week and couldn't go.
