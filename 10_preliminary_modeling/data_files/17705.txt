I don't remember the start of the dream...it may have been connected in the following dream somehow.  I went to Myst, and down into the large elevator tree.  I couldn't find the button to send it back up, but there was a wire hanging out.  I touched the two ends of the wire and that activated it, so it started going back up.  I got out at ground level, but there was a little glow of white between the two wires when I got out.  Several moves upwards and the elevator exploded.  I guess I died...the dream was a 'redo'.  This time on the way back up, I touched the wires to my tongue to 'extinguish' the glow that caused the spark and the explosion.  I got out and went towards my car, and I found my 7th grade PE teacher to be following me.  We tried to open the car.  The keys looked like wire, not regular car keys.
