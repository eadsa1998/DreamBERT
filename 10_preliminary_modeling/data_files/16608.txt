One thing ____________ Derek gave me a p______ ____book that was kind of small, about the size of a planner, somebody's like planner book, and it was in a ring binder like a planner book would be, but it had a rubber jacket cover on it and it had this pocket on the inside, and it had a really fancy pen with it. You know how sometimes you get a pen that's super business-like and super fancy? Well, this one was like that, and apparently he got a pen with it so that he could mark on the ______ about important financial ______ what to do and the arrangement based on how you produce them and how you created your income from that __________________ sheet. And another thing that was really cool and really significant and I was going to keep it -- I don't remember if it was something that he knew, that he had, or whether it was something that he found for me and gave me because he thought that I would like. But I remember that it was, I don't know -- I mean that was all there was to it.
