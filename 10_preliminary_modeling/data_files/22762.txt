I was with a group of friends and we were going to go driving. I was in front of the car with a girl and a fat man who came close to me and wanted to grab me. He got out and I shouted: "Idiot!" and he stuck his hand through the window and grabbed. He didn't seem perturbed. The car started and the girl told me, "What a man! He probably wanted to go like this." And she started to kiss my neck and then as though she had just realized it, she became serious. I was disgusted and terrified. We arrived to some place where there was a girlfriend and a boyfriend: Charlie. I told them and they said that she was sick and the boss (lady) told me to take care of myself. Afterwards we were in a patio with Charlie and to the side there was a closed window which he opened. A noise like those in horror films came in and he asked me whether he should open it all the way. The noise was strong and he told his friend to open it all the way.
