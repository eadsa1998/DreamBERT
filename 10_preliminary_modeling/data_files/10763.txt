I was sitting in the front seat of a car with a man I cannot identify. We were in a very close embrace, but instead of kissing me, he was trying to make me stutter. His method involved my repeating certain words after him. This was supposed to make me very tense. Then he asked me some questions and told me that upon answering them I would stutter. I concentrated real hard on my answers and replied very slowly. As a result I did not stutter. He didn't seem too disappointed.
