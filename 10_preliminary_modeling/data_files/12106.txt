I somehow ended up in a new galaxy or planet. People looked slightly different. I ended up with a group of people. I remember Erik Stolhanske, Paul Soter and Sam (from Club Dread, who is played by Erik Stolhanske). Sam was the first one I'd met, and he was really nice. This killer dude was around. Some of the group got bitten by a werewolf. We had to leave them. There were then 6 of us. I got in the car with Sam. We drove away and then the car stalled. The killer came and killed him. I ran off back to the other car. I was in the back with Erik, who was also nice. Paul died at some house. Erik was saying how he "wanted us to be together" but we couldn't because I was going and he was on a different planet.
