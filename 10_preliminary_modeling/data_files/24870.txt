I was sitting at home, back in my Mom's bedroom, lying in bed. Then I heard the dog barking really loud. I yelled at my mom to ask why she was barking but I got no response. I got up out of bed &amp; no one else was home. Setting: In my house. Characters: I heard my dog, a golden retriever, and my mom. Feelings and Thoughts: Confused. It was very short, and I thought it was really strange.
