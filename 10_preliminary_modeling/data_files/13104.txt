Some time traveling people were after me. There was an old lady. David Tennant was unlocking this door (I had run out at one stage and then had run back in) and I locked it again. I, or someone, killed the old lady and put her in this air thing. David Tennant came out. There were these things which flew into your mouth, 'rape' you and give you a funny feeling in your stomach and then you die. I think I was an alien. Whoever had them made a compromise with me and would take me instead of killing me or something. They had these strips to track people. There was also this cool TOM-TOM thing and I was looking for Eugene. It said that he was in 'Spaceman' which was a suburb or a street.
