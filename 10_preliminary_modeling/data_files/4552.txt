["New TV."] I am in a building that has bleacher style seats, like in a raked theater setting. Blue upholstery. I have ordered a new TV set. They deliver two of them so I can choose which style I prefer. One is about a 35" screen and all white plastic. The other is a smaller screen, and lovely hard wood. They put the wood one in a corner that is not where I want it. I want the TV in front of my two couches. One couch is like the yellow loveseat of my old house. Charla and I sit on it to watch TV even though the bigger couch is near by. They think I want the pretty wood one, but I prefer the white one because it has a bigger screen. They thought I wanted it in a corner, but I wanted it in front of the couches. Later, I walk up to the special bleachers through a small gate up high. It is the church area. Later, I walk down to the bottom part and lie down on the bench and experience an orgasm.
