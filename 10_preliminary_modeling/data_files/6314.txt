A dream I had recently went like this. I was at a cottage on a dock we stayed at in Nantucket. I was in a room with my girlfriend and a few of my friends. We were all drinking. My girlfriend was in the room but she was wearing a bikini. All my friends were staring at her. I began to get mad but I held it in. I can remember becoming really uncomfortable. While we were all sitting around drinking I told her that she should change, but she did not listen to me. Then one by one my friends started talking to her and trying to kiss her and grab her breasts. I flew off the handle. I grabbed everyone who did this and threw them out a window into the water. (The cottage was part of the dock and it was on stilts over the water.) Then my girlfriend started to cry. I asked her why she was crying. She said because they were my friends that I threw out the window. I kept telling her that they weren't because, "They were trying to kiss you," but she couldn't understand that. I woke up, but I had the feeling that when I woke up that something was unresolved.
