A lady was drawing the sky with 2 pastels. One was sky blue. The other was periwinkle blue. She was nervous and kept peeling the paper off the ends. The 2 layers of clouds were conversations between 2 people at different altitudes. So the wind currents blew the conversation and the clouds would blend into each other meaning the conversation was incoherent and that's when things got interesting. My father was picking out a place to go hang gliding in the mountains. I had a parachute man bout 4 inches tall and green plastic, and the parachute was white plastic connected with white sewing thread. I was getting my parachute man ready to throw him up in the air. I'd been making earrings. Circles with different centers. The dimension of the inner circle was about .75 as the outer one. Other earrings were oxidized dimes on the 'heads' side coated with shiny stuff to keep rust from getting in your ears. The CIA Bomb Squad was setting up bobby traps and wiring the aluminum fold-up tables with explosives. The children liked to sit under the aluminum table and I knew the CIA was going to blow them up. There were triplets who were about 5 years old, who came to the garage to play. They were wearing footie pajamas the color of lime sherbet. There was a basketball goal but no ball. The older children came to play--unaware they were about to be annihilated. They tried to detonate the bomb underneath the aluminum tabletop. Christy was waiting on me. She did not want to go play tennis. I was playing the piano and she said she was tired of waiting on me. I had NO INTENTION of going. Instead I climbed up on the roof and looked at the shingles. My father said we had no running water till he fixed the pipes. There were lots of doors to open to the basement and different people behind each one.
