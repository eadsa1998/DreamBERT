I was in an auditorium listening to an assembly when I noticed an old friend sitting behind me. He saw me and smiled. He is about twenty years old. When the assembly was over, he stood up and said to his friend, who was sitting next to him, that I was his wife. When we started taIking, he asked me for a date. I accepted, and as we were about to leave, a man fell dead on the stage. We rushed to the stage and crowded around the man. The man turned out to be another friend of mine. When I turned around to look at my husband (I accepted him my husband now), he was grinning from ear to ear, and I was very angry.
