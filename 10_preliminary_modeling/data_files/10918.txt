I dreamt that I was crossing the street toward 107th Street by the Elysium Auto Sales when I heard some people in a car plotting a murder. Somehow I seemed to keep going back and forth across the street without seeming to be detected, and thus hearing the whole plot. A man who was a gangster was going to murder his mother-in-law. The only motive for this crime seemed to be that she had bought a hat that was too small for her. This gangster later found out that I heard the plot and was going to try to catch me. There was a man at the Elysium Auto Sales who was going to help me from being caught, however. The murderer's gang had come to the building where I was in a car. When I got in the car, it seemed to be enclosed; there was another car in front of it and the wall of the building in the back. When I did try to go, I seemed to go backwards. As the car seemed to start its slow backward motion, the dream ended.
