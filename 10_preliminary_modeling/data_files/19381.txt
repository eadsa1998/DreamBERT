Me and my friend Joe were in Las Vegas (we're going tomorrow for real), and I was filming a Street Dance Show, zooming in and out of piles of clothes on the street on the way into a casino. My view was as if I was flying very close to the ground, real fast, zig-zaggings, back and forth between people's legs. We then went to a little kiosk on the street and an older, chubby, white lady was selling stuff. I took a blue Pilot marker from Joe, who just tagged her shop, and she thought that I did it.
