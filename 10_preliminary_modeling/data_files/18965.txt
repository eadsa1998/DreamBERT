This is a two-part dream. Part one consisted of myself being inside of some type of store, and I was showing somebody or selling somebody some type of jewelry. There were two pieces. There was a mechanism about 6 inches in diameter with some sort of moving parts inside of the moving mechanism, a Marine Corps globe and anchor emblem on it. It was made out of gold, and there was also a device that resembled a cigarette case that had little bumps in it, little indentations. It was made out of silver, and I was trying to convince this person that they should buy the thing that was made out of silver, as opposed to the gold, because silver is a little bit more subtle. It doesn't shout status as gold does. <br/
