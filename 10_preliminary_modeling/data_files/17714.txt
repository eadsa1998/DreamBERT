I dreamt my family's pet cat Nina gave birth to nine black kittens.  We were upset because we'd supposedly had her spayed years ago.  The kittens were cute, but I had to take care to make sure they were all getting fed- we were feeding them with an eyedropper for some reason.  They all looked alike so I wasn't sure if they were all getting fed.  My boyfriend Jeremy asked me if we were keeping them all and I told him he was crazy, we'd keep maybe one at most.
