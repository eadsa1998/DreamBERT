Frank and I are in a strange town: on vacation. We go to some peoples' home and Frank is very friendly with the wife who is Jewish. He looks at old photos, rummages through drawers, and has trouble saying goodbye. I finally nudge him and say, "I'm tired." We leave. Then there is a drawing contest but I don't win. It was a mandala type drawing. --Frank is somewhere at a movie. I find him and he apologizes. He leaves early half way through the movie and gets his money back.
