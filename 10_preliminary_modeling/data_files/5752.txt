[1997-06-06] There were a lot of my relatives at my house from Alabama, including my little nieces, one of whom is 10 years old. We were in the living room and it was early in the morning and she was looking at some novel that she had seen at her mother's house. She asked me who it belonged to, I said I didn't know. I don't remember the name 9of it I had never heard of it. But we were talking and the television was on real low, the stereo was also on low and the radio9 was on in the kitchen. They were all on different stations. We were just talking and I got up to check the mail and as I was reaching into the mail box, someone from across the street said "Hello" and I answered him and then I realized that he wasn't talking to me and I thought "Boy that happens so often. Its so embarrassing to answer and yet you have to answer when you think someone is talking to you. I had some really clear feelings and thoughts about that. Them I got back in and realized there was a napkin stuck to the front of my pants and I thought "Oh boy, I hope nobody noticed that." Then I was talking to my niece and she said something about cutting the grass or raking the leaves or something. I said "well, do you do that at home?" and she said "yeah" and I said, "well if you want to do that here I'll pay you, I'll give you a thousand dollars if you want it just to go out and cut the grass and clean up the yard a little bit." Then we laughed.
