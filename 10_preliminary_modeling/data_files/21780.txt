I was with Margie S. She was wanted for some crime by police. I went after her thru a trap door into the attic. To my surprise she was invisible because Mr. Lasko (deceased) came up and a dog also came up and neither of them could see her or me. The two police came up, looked around, walked by us and didn't see us. Marty gave me a daily double. He showed me different doubles that won and one that seemed to stick with me was 56. I saw 75 and lot of others that won before. I looked into a movie in Rivertown. It was 10 cents and the movie was an all-night movie.
