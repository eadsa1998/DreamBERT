I am in my mother's room, trying to phone Mary's father (she and her boyfriend are in the room with me). She has called her father, but has spoken to him about something else, something about their house. What I want to do is ask him to have an armed battalion (navy), but just as I call him, I realize that he is not going to understand anything, and I hang up. Facts: Mary is a friend of mine since childhood; she is 23; her boyfriend is 22; her father is a doctor.
