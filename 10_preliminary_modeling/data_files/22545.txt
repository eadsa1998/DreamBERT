Last night I dreamed I went to the beach. It was summertime and very sunny. They came to pick me up and we went to San Bartolo in the car of my cousin's husband. I had gotten an orange bikini. It was a bikini which had rings and suited me well. We got to the beach and I ran to the shore and took off my beach robe and swam to the raft, which wasn't very far out, and felt very happy in the water. It was a beautiful dream. I was swimming for a long time and I laughed and had lots of fun. I do remember that my cousin, her husband and myself went to the beach, but once we got there, he stopped the car and I got out and went down to the beach and I didn't see them any more, but I was very happy at the beach.
