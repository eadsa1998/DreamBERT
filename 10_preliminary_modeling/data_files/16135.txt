I had a dream. I dreamt that we were in the back yard and that Lucy and Robert were planning to buy a house, and we had several rows of chairs set up in the back yard. And Lucy and Robert were looking in the window of our house, and they were going to tell the people in the back row, who were going to tell the people in the next row, who were going to tell the people in the next row until it got all the way to the front row, about the comments about our house. And it was supposed to be like a communication system without them having to yell. That was weird. And then I dreamt that we were in this hotel and this guy was kind of like overstaying his welcome. He didn't check out or something. And he wasn't supposed to be in that certain room. So they took him and they were going to take him to another room, and the other room was like a dark cellar thing like an elevator shaft, and they just threw him down the elevator shaft, and he went, "Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh....." And then I woke up. [laugh]
