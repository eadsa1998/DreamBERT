Dad had knocked down the old house and there were four small units there. The pool was still there. One of the units was 'separate' and could be bought. The others had to be rented. Dad was staying in the place he bought but was changing it. He had had it for 20 months or something. The bed was 'in' the wall, on the ground because the place was tiny. I went on Runescape and Calvin was on there and was level 106. I was shocked at this. He had been playing it quite a bit lately and I checked his account and he had only signed up 5 days ago. He had lots of level 90 stats and lots of quests done. I was annoyed, but realized something was wrong and it also said he had only played for a total of 72 hours. Ezra and I were at the shop. I bought some food with my own money. I got biscuits and Nutri-Grain as it was going to run out tomorrow. Someone asked me for money and I said that I had like $3 and managed to get rid of them. When we left, Ezra ate all the food. I asked Mom to pay me back but she refused.
