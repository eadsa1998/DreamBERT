A dinosaur. I am on its back. A large beautiful snake, green and shiny, with gold threads, is its driver. I must hold on to her head just behind the jaw to keep from getting bit and to control where to go. She tries to bite me. I have to be very strong to keep her under control. I am struggling hard and I almost can't do it. She turns to look at me and says, "'Little girls' shouldn't (or couldn't) do this." [BL]
