I was lining up for the bus and Jake was there. Calvin got on the bus before me and someone got on through the other side. I got on when the teacher wasn't looking and the bus started. People were pushing me back. I went next to Calvin and got the window seat. The bus took off and left the others behind. I was annoyed because Dmitri was on the other bus. Daryl was in the crowd.
