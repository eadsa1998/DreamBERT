 I'm at Brimson in the upstairs gymnasium. I'm sleeping or trying to sleep. People are playing basketball in the gymnasium. They include my high school teammates Carl Everson, Bill Jamison, and a man I know as J.P., who is a guard. I think he may be my coworker from Fishing Haven Jerry Parsons. The Brimson basketball players are there. They are practicing and have a team meeting. I go to the meeting because I want to join the team. There is a game then. I start as a player in the game. There is a man that is 6'10". I'm not sure whose team he is on. I block a shot, and play all right in the game.
