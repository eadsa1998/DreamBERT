 I'm at a library. I go to a desk to pay for damage that was done to books while I check them out: one page was torn out of a book and a magazine. I don't think I inflicted the damage. I sit down across from a woman at the desk. There is a pile of money in front of me that she doesn't see because it's behind part of the desk. I give it to the woman, saying someone must have left it here. I think I do this because if came back to claim the money and I had it, I would feel guilty and greedy. So, I give it to the woman at the desk. I talk to her about paying for the missing pages. It will cost about $1 per page. I'm sick: I have a cold and my nose is running. I blow my nose into my handkerchief. I feel crusty and sick.
