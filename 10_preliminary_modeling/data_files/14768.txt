I was on a plane. This German lady asked me how to ask for tickets to see a pyramid and she said she knew how to say that she had pajamas. I saw Ms Bigwood on there. Sometimes I was with Joshua Jackson, who was young. I said jokingly, "I hate that Pacey guy, every time I see his face I just want to vomit". He looked at me and we started laughing. Later, I was at home and Ezra had knocked on my door but it was locked. I was getting dressed and when I was done, I said come in. I was watching Supernatural and I had it paused on Sam making a face, so I unpaused it and paused it again on Dean. No-one came in. I continued watching then I heard a scraping and he and Mom came in suddenly. I was like 'what the hell?!'. They were looking around and they implied that they were looking for proof that I was masturbating. I was like "uh... right, can you go now I'm trying to watch Supernatural". They kept coming into my room so I didn't leave the room. The mailbox had Nurofen and other drugs in it.
