 There is a race in the winter. The participants use lawn mowers, but ride on the back of the mower like in a sled dog race. My boss Mike Hollow and my roommate Sean Williams are there. I try the mower and I go slowly. The race is on a snow-covered trail in the forest. A man I know from Brimson named Korey is there. He it talking on a pay phone to someone about fishing for Lake Trout.
