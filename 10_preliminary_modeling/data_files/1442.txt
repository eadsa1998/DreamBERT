I am walking along. I see a cute guy in a wheelchair; he's a low level quad in a manual. He invites me to sit on his lap. I do so. We laugh and enjoy hugging and being close. Someone else comes by and says they need the chair. I am upset. How rude. He needs the chair and I need this nice warm connection. I get out. It's over. I cry and cross the bridge alone.
