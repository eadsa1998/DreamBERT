I was in a room above the garage in my home. The room was used for storage. I was attempting to clean it up and in a desk I found all my notebooks and school work from the time I was in grade-school. I also found some photographs of myself at Girl scout Camp when I was 12 years old. In these photographs I had on a striped bathing suit. I was enjoying myself while looking through all my old notebooks etc. Then I came across a piece of art paper upon which was pasted a stylized primitive figure. I was very surprised for this design was exactly like a design which I have been stenciling in my Related Arts course (in real life). I had a sense of guilt because I felt that I had copied a design. The fact that it was my own design did not decrease my guilt.
