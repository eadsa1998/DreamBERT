It was early in the morning. It needed to be earlier to catch the bus to the outside parts of the city and follow people at 6 a.m. The next day I got up early so Dora could sleep and I followed the people to the Y. I left home at 5:30. When I cut through the locker-room it was full of loud, sweating, very strong women. You could see their muscles. I drew a huge, long skinny 8 the length of my forearm on the inside. I drew another line and then decided to fill it in. I wanted some paint the color of blood--but then there were so many colors of fingernail polish like blood that I painted it in with red fingernail problems. (text says "problems" instead of "polish." I was in the way of the big, strong, sweating basketball players in the locker room. Some who were already late to leave. We were waiting for the Russians to bomb us. WW III. They had a landfill on a strip which they never checked. The baseball field was nearby. There was a floating aluminum lounge chair in the water. I got 3 containers of cake icing from the freezer. Even though the Russians were gonna bomb the landfill and us I had to see the cupcakes.
