I found myself in my kitchen with a few of my girlfriends, but the only one I could recognize was one red-headed one. They were telling me to hurry with my breakfast as it was already 8:05 a.m. and the red-headed girl said that we had to leave at exactly 8:10 a.m. if we wished to make our 9:00 a.m. class. I was in a terrible state for I knew I could never possibly make it as I still had to get dressed.
