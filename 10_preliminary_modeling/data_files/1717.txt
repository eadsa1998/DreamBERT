There is a policeman and he and I are somewhere. We are going to make a report, but I have a handcuff on my left wrist, dangling unattached to anything. I ask him as a favor to take it off me before we go in because I don't want anyone to think I'm the criminal. Later we are going to go stay at a motel, but I decide we will go home instead. He is disappointed. I try to reassure him. He can still sleep with me, but it's not the same.
