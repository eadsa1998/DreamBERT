I had another kind of crazy dream about being in Jackson. I couldn't figure out if I was in Jackson or I was in a class. Believe it or not. We were doing this Jeopardy game and it was really like awful stuff. I wanted to go with some other students to go have my picture taken by the kindergarten pod at Oceanside. I felt like we were there. But yet we were in this classroom doing this Jeopardy game __________ and I don't remember what it was about. I think it was something about geography. And then the next thing I knew I was like down in Aunt Christine's basement by the washing machine, and I had a desk and a computer and I was entering _________________. And I was thinking to myself how I really, I didn't want to be down there, but I could fool myself into thinking I was just in a room and not in a basement, which is kind of how I would think when I would sneak down there. And I was hearing this story. Somebody was talking and telling me this story about an organist who played a morning service, an afternoon service and an evening service. He had like three services in a day, and he had to play them all at this organ that was in this basement. He had to come down there and ________ off in the sanctuary. That was really bizarre. And I was thinking how really I wouldn't want to be down there for that long. I guess that came from one day I was joking around about the hot water heater in our cellar, and I was saying how, you know, the ducts for the heater, "Oh, these could be organ pipes and the console could be right down here." And then I thought ______________, "I wouldn't want to play down here." And Mom said, "Well, no you wouldn't, especially if somebody shut off the light and closed the door."
