The concert was overflowing with people. Out on the stage stepped Nelson Eddy, America's favorite baritone. I had talked to him before the concert and told him that someday I would like to sing on this very stage. Imagine my surprise when he asked me to sing several numbers on the program with him, the great Nelson Eddy.
