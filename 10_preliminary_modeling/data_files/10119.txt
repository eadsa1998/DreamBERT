I am at a Conference that involves a disciplined schedule, good food and fine warm showers. I am told by the president of the Assn. that I am to give a talk on Friday, but on that day everything seems to go wrong: I take a shower with all my clothes on, can't find my notes, can't remember what I was to say... embarrassed.
