I'm in an old run-down house. The floor boards of my bedroom are rotted through and a hole is developing. I'm in bed near a stairwell. I realize some of the clothes on my floor have slid down into the hole. I wonder where my father is. He could fix the hole. I reach for the clothes and slide into the hole myself and fall under the house in a horrible pile of debris that is rotting away. I feel fear that I will rot with it. I fight my way back up into the house and walk down the hall asking where everyone is. Dwight is in his room, the furthest one away. My mother's in her room. I'm near the front door and a monster from hell comes at me. I am very afraid but stand my ground. I grab its tongue at its roots and pull, even though I know he'll bite me and it will be terribly painful. I poke his eye with a stick and drag him out of the house. He's unconscious and I crawl back to the house with a match. I light the carpet on the porch, wondering if I should go in first and get our possessions, but it is more important to torch it at once. I light it. The monster comes at me, but is consumed in the flames. I look to make sure all my family is safely out of the house. One is missing and then I see her -  Dwight, Jake, my mother, my father, Charla and me. We walk down the road and I say, "Are we homeless? And we don't even have a car to live in." [BL]
