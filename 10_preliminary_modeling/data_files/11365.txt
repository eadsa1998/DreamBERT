The dream opens in the midst of a Milton Berle rehearsal. Milton Berle gets into an argument with one of his employees. The man gets very mad, and takes out of a box a long, black, horrible snake. The snake appears to be almost human in intelligence and rationalization. Berle is extremely afraid of the snake. The man goes but he leaves the snake behind him. Every time Berlie makes a move, the snake watches him with apprehensive eyes. The snake then began to purposely annoy Berle in an almost human fashion. It would crawl toward Berle in a sort of motion, Berle would be very frightened and run and jump all over the furniture. While running he would be frantically holding on to the mike. He would be continually trying to continue the show in a horribly frightened way. It was sheer frustration at its utmost. I myself was frieghtened while dreaming it.
