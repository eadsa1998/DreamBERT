A woman is in the passenger side of a car. She has lied and said she lives in this huge blue house. So the driver takes her to the house and is waiting to see how she'll handle this. The woman stalls for time but the driver waits, knowing she lied. Finally, a woman in the house notices the car and goes out to see what's going on. She thinks someone 's come to visit her. She says hello. The woman in the car brazens it out and gets out of the car and goes into the house with her as though they knew each other. Now we're inside and I'm the woman in the car. The woman of the house puts me to work. I start doing dishes and she tells me to make a casserole for dinner. I ask for a recipe and she says, "Just do the usual, use three groups of food." I decide it is necessary to do this work for pay for her hospitality. I don't like it much. Ellie and possibly Charla are there and I'm annoyed that she's not doing her share of the work. Now Hank comes in. I bring food into the living room to serve the guests and clean up. Hank is being uppity and ridiculing me. I get angry and slap him in the face several times. He's got a beard and a chubby face (like Howard). I tell him I don't like him. I drop some food on a pillow on the floor and sit to pick it up, trying to clean it up. Hank looks on contemptuously.
