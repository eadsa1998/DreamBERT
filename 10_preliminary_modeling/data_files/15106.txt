I got two packages in the mail. One was a Brownshirt shirt except it had a picture on the front of some character in cartoon form. It said XL, but had 4XL underneath. It fit like an XL though. There was a tiny Jayne (Firefly) face in the background, and Mal was at the front. Was going to complain about it and show it to Mom.
