In this dream I think I was just an onlooker to an old-time, meaning a 17th or 16th century fight aboard a ship, like between pirates. The only thing I can remember about it was I think that the hero of the dream was hiding in a big barrel. He was hiding down in this thing, and evidently he was on board the enemy ship or something because I remember him being crouched down in this big barrel. <br/
