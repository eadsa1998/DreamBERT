I was in an alternate world. The alternate me was in Arrested Development. It kept changing to real life. I was in a kitchen with Jason Bateman and he said something and then Will Arnett came in and replied to Jason and what he said 'confirmed' that we had had sex, which he had. I was playing with Simba later. I called him Tigger and then said "No, you're Simba". Claire (Heroes) wasn't healing and was dying. She left. Ezra and I were on the side of the road and we went to find her. It was night time. She was leaning against a log thing on the side of the road. We went to her and she healed. Then all these people with cameras came. She was wearing boots and they were muddy. She said "why waste $2000 [on other shoes]". I went to this room and I looked for the number 217. I had to find a piece of paper. Snoopy was in there. The outside of the room was glass and had this thing you could lift and go in. Later a cat was sticking its head out. Mom and Ezra distracted Snoopy and I let the dogs and cats out of the room. The room was messy and my pen broke and I so did my torch. I fixed them. Mom and a friend were at a table later. Someone was making some bread things. Will Arnett was crying.
