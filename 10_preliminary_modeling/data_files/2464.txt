I am in the M City house living room, in the early morning. Howard and Pete T are there to celebrate my birthday. Howard just sits there and doesn't do much. Pete brings presents, songs and joy. He represents Mary his wife. Now I sit on the couch. Lucy is seated on my left. Four babies crawl all over us, full of energy. One grabs my breast and sucks. I'm quite surprised as I'm not his mother and I don't have milk. I pull back and tuck my breast quickly back into my bra. Apparently it had accidentally been hanging out. I see a few drops of breast milk. There are four cats on the couch with us as well. Lucy is very sad and upset. She cries and cries about how she'll be going home soon to smoke more pot. No matter how much she tries, she can't seem to stop doing it. She feels hopeless. I feel a strong desire to give her advice. I feel she is just not trying hard enough. She's wailing so much about how hard it is, she's not just "doing it." My mother is tired and I say to her, "Next year, we'll do this at my house. All you'll have to do is make your usual two pies. I'll do all the other work." I hope she's happy and she sighs, happy but not convinced.
