Mom was babysitting again, and she had two or three kids sitting in the wagon, and you know you take the front of the wagon down and you use it like a bench? Well, that's what she was doing. And I had a feeling that they were kids that I knew, but I didn't really know their names, like I don't remember who they were, but I felt like I knew them. And there was this chicken that I was holding. I was over by the chicken cage sitting in the dirt where the truck usually parks, and I was holding this chicken that was a darker brown than a Rhode Island Red, like almost black. And I had a feeling like that chicken had been either abused or terrorized in another yard at another place, either by a dog or by a person. And I was petting this chicken, trying to calm her down, and she did calm down. And I was like talking to her and singing to her, and I was going to teach her how to be a petting zoo chicken for these kids. [laugh] And, you know, that was the whole point. I think there was more, but I don't remember what the heck else happened.
