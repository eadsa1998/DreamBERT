I see Jeramy T and he is leading a men's singing group. They are doing beautiful harmonies and chants like monks. They are in a round area and I want to sing with them. I have my two daughters, Ellie and perhaps Paulina. I take them by the hand and walk around the outer walls of this area looking for an opening to go in and watch and listen. I find one and sit on a large rock and listen to the beautiful sounds. Now I am somewhere else and holding a baby who is crying and very uncomfortable because she has wet her diapers and her clothes. I lay her down and Aunt Millie and Bonnie are near and we are talking. I shush us and say, "Now they will think we are visiting," like that would be viewed as a bad thing. I try to change the baby's clothes. The diaper is a Pampers kind of thing that is transparent in places and built up in places where it is needed. I get it on, unsure of how to do it. I ask my daughter to get her blanket. I put her in a sleeper and I hold her, realizing she is now asleep. I can tell because her entire body is curled and relaxed like a cat. I know it must feel wonderful for her. I pace, holding her and look for a place to sit down, but every place is filled with people. I am a bit annoyed, but don't want to wake the baby. It feels good to hold her. Now my roommate has two tickets to two evenings of entertainment. I already got my two tickets for Tuesday and Thursday night. Hers is for two other nights. I think of going with her and getting tickets, only then I'd be going out four nights in a row and maybe we'd not get seats together. Some movie star man sits next to another man and I wonder if they are lovers.
