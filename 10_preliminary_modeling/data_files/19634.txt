I wish to learn dates of publication of certain of Montaignes' essays. Chester is trying to find out for me by inquiries at the book binder (or possible at a book store). He has come to ask some questions, and I explain that the essays, which are contained in 3 volumes, were probably written at different times. Chester says he has advised that I had better go to a librarian and get the desired information.
