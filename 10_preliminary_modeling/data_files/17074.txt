John Lennon and Paul McCartney were sitting on the floor in a hallway. They were on the second floor of their mansion. They were young with looks as if it were the late 1960's. Occasionally, George Harrison walked by and said something, but mostly John and Paul were there. Sitting next to them was a cameraman filming them. He was about their age. John and Paul kept getting annoyed with him and they'd push him by the forehead, so that he'd fall on his back. John had a guitar, and they were singing and writing a new song. They decided to live and sleep there, in the hall, naked, except for shorts made out of paper bags, with leg holes cut out of them, and the bag going up to their chests. They had a pillow inside it for a cushion to sit on. Then they poured Ruffles potato chips in their paper bag shorts, and crushed them by sitting on them. They laughed, and declared that it was for some unknown political cause.
