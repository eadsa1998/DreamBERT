 I'm at the plasma donation center. I'm there late. The cut-off time for new or returning donors is 6:00, and it's now 6:45 or so. I get in anyways. They talk to me about doing some kind of a stick or line test of some sort. I reply that I can do a Rorschach test whenever I want, and that their request is silly. I eat out of a bin of quick oatmeal. In it are oats and dried fruit. The finger prick for blood is unusually aversive to me: I fear it.
