I am at a computer working on html coding, but I don't know if I'm at my home office or at the CAS office. I found two or three changes that needed to be made throughout the document I was working on and in different places in the lines of coding. I was thinking of ways to improve the effectiveness of how I accomplish this task in the future. to get it done in less time and to require fewer edits or corrections. I thought about getting a binder and printing out the pages of coding and putting them in page protectors. I realized this wasn't a good idea but that I could go ahead and get the binder and page protectors that I'd been thinking about ordering to put together a binder of all of my quick reference sheets. I thought it would be a good to use my quick reference sheet for editing with my html code and if I put this binder together it would might be easier for me to use that particular reference sheet.
