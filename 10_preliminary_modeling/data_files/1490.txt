Something male and dark is chasing me. A small boy, possibly my brother or someone I'm babysitting is on my back. I must protect him too. I run out of the house and up a tree, carrying the boy. His arms are wrapped tightly around me. As I climb up a rope to the tree, I see a huge black panther rushing out at me. Now I'm even in worse danger. I turn and run back toward the house with the panther hot on my trail. I run in and try to slam the door shut. I can't because the panther's claws are in my arm. I pull his claws out of my skin. It is painful. I force his paws back and then I slam the door shut on his front legs. I know this will hurt the panther, but I have no choice. I put the boy down and go to the window. I lay on a mattress and look up to the sky. I see a full moon and a cherub baby asleep on a cloud, or like the decals on my dresser that my mother put there when I was little. It looks like a child's book illustration, all cutesy. Suddenly I know that my mother is dead. I sob and sob my grief. I feel sorry I never really tried to get to know her. I am inconsolable. My crying wakes Ellie and Paulina who come to me and hug me. Ellie hugs me from behind. I feel her strong arms around my chest. I am at first sorry I woke them and then glad of their support. (I wake up hearing my grieving wails and thankfully realize it was a dream. It was so real.)
