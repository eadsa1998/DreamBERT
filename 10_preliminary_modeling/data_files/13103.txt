Charlie Higson and some black guy were running for president. They were coming a tie, which was 60/60, and I was like 'eh?'. I was watching The Fast Show and there was something about utopia. I was also looking at something about Young Bond. I was thinking of Paul Whitehouse. We had an excursion. I was on the same bus as Ezra. Clayton was in front of me. Ezra and Clayton had chips and I was eating them too. It was our first excursion together. Calvin wasn't on the bus. Some of the street names were Impressive and Screenplay. Mom and Darren went to the US for some wine thing. They didn't want to stay the night.
