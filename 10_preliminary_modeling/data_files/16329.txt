We had this black chicken who was kind of learning a little bit about how to be tame with people, and kind of watching what the white chicken and the red chicken were doing. And one day they saw the chickens jumping up on me, like they do, and being friendly and wanting food. Well, this black chicken decides she's going to jump from the nest onto my arm, and hang onto my shoulder. And this chicken was so heavy, I thought I was going to die. Actually what it was, was she was perched on my arm and trying to hang on by gripping my shirt with her feet on my shoulder. And I don't know why, but I could barely hold up this chicken's weight, and so I kind of had to put her down. And then I dreamt that Serena was coming by to bring us something and she had a portable radio and she was kind of using it like a cell phone to dial toll-free numbers. I can't remember anything else; I know there was more.
