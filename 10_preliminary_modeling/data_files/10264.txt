Frank and I are at a place like the A. House in the southeastern part of the state, and there are lots of visitors. we stop to have something to eat before we leave; we can't go in by the front door, but discover open French doors that lead to the Library; Frank and I have to SQUEEZE in behind a woman librarian. When I look around I see a stream of people coming in by the main entrance; it looks like an Easter parade. We eat some hot soup and go for a hike.
