I was at Central Lutheran and I was watching Mikhail play the organ. And they had a white floor, and kind of reddish pews, which they really have. And the white floor had no carpet. And there was somebody up in the loft. And Pastor Gregg was there. And there was this woman archbishop who was guest speaking, and she reminded me of something out of Prairie Home Companion. It was like a really solemn day. She was just really flippety flippety, and I thought to myself, "Oh gee, this isn't going to bode well for Pastor Gregg ________________ and things." And she was in a red kind of a flowery pink dress and the thing of it was, is that the organ was playing itself because Mikhail was, he had this mini sequencer thing that he could call up on it, and somebody said that they wanted to hear "Phantom of the Opera" so Mikhail made the organ play "Phantom of the Opera." [laugh] And then there was something else, and the organ played some other goofy out-of-place song. And I was sitting in the back with Marilou and two other of her friends, and Mom was there too. She was supposed to pick me up. But for some reason I just sort of followed Marilou and her two girlfriends. And they were getting on a bus, so I got on a bus with them. And I asked them, "Well, where is this bus going?" And they were like, "Oh, it's going to a tanning salon in Bayfront." And I said, "I don't want to go to a tanning salon." And Marilou said, "Well no, the bus is going and my college is another state." I think it was Virginia or something. And so it seemed like there was only a _____ on that big bus, and so the driver was kind enough to pull off at the first exit that we'd come to, which was just after US 19, I think. And so I had to call Mom on the cell phone. I was sitting at like this little rest area park thing at a picnic table, and I was calling Mom and telling her where I was. And she said, "Okay, no problem, I'll be right there." And then I woke up.
