 I'm in a room like a hotel or dorm room. My classmate Diane Borders is there. It is as if we are sharing a room. She hast eh room first, and then I was placed there. Outside the deck-like screen window is a large gray metal tunnel. It is about six feet long and goes to the outside. I see and hear someone coming in. I go over to the window and see my classmate John Thomas climbing in the tunnel with a bunch of guys behind him. When he sees me he stops. I exchange words with the other men, and tell them to leave our place along. One short fat man is particularly belligerent. I can kick his ass. Back in the room, Diane and I are on separate beds and don't say much to each other. It is a little before 3:00 pm. She is trying to rest before we both need to leave at 3:15 or 3:30. I'm watching television. I use the remote control to shit the television off, but it keeps turning back on again as soon as I shut it off! I start to talk to Diane, asking her about the living arrangements at first, since I was just placed here. We start talking about other things. I realize that she looks almost exactly alike my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas. Then Diane is Annie and she has made a brief trip to Australia, stopping in Amsterdam first. There is an old, tall, dead, leafless tree. It is very large. There may be a nest in it.
