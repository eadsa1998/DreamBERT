I sat the tables were filling up and called H. then R. to hurry. She came out of the bedroom in a trim suit and J. joined us and we looked for places at the table. Before R. and J. came in I saw a small boy of 7 or 8 and asked what he was doing. "Was he a fish?" "No fisherman." "Then I won't take you, a fisherman wouldn't be good to eat, would it?" I said jokingly. When we reach the tables, only at the right hand sides of the right hand table are there three seats together. Someone has put a scarf on one next them. We sit down. Just before dessert some disturbance occurs. We get up to look, on our return find our seats are occupied by some men. We protest but they don't leave, so I seize back of one chair and tip man on the floor and say, "Now my brother needs a seat too and tip a second man out."
