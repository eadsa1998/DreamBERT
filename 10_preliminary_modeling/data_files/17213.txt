I was Sam in Quantum Leap, as a woman, in the bathroom.  I turned and was about to leave because it was cold, and a man in a towel asked me where I was going.  When I told him, he said, "No" and pushed me stomach-first to the tiled floor.  He said his genitals were warm.  He opened his towel and got on top of me.  I felt his warmth on my butt; he was preparing for anal sex.
