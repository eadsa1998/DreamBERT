I was at home and it was like the end of the world or something. I was pregnant and my boyfriend/husband was with me. I got hurt somehow and I was sitting on the grass dragging myself to the car. I got to the top of the drive way and then it was just me. I was making my way back to the house when some people came through the gate with guns. They wanted to come in and I refused. A guy pointed a gun at me but I didn't back down. Then my 'brother' was a friend of his and my brother had like taken off to the streets years before, but he told the guy to back off and they got into a fight. I went inside and ran to my room and called the police. I was whispering and saying there were people outside with guns, but an automatic message thing kept saying that I was speaking too quietly.
