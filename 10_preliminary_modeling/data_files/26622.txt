 I get into the passenger seat of a station wagon that a woman is driving. A woman who may be my wife gets in the car next to me. I hold a tiny newborn baby in my right arm. It is very small! It is clean, soft, pure, beautiful, and unspoiled. I wanted to have my wife hold the baby as I got in the car, and then I would hold it as she got in, just to be extra careful about not dropping the baby. But this didn't happen. We need to drive from the roadside on Home Avenue I Oak Valley, around the corner to our alley. It's not very far, but I don't want to take a chance of harming the baby. We make it around the corner, though the woman is not a good driver: we swerve a lot.
