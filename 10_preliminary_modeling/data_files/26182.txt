 Beavis and Butthead are in Armstrong High School. Beavis has a sexual interaction with a woman, and describes it to Butthead. My friend Kevin Simpson and housemate Stephen Ramos take a photograph of an administrator. There is a female administrator with really good film. They get in trouble. There is a dance-like activity between the junior and sophomore lockers, and many Armstrong graduates are there. It's a small party. My high school classmate Jack Miller is there. I'm in a house that is very dirty: paper and garbage are everywhere, junk. There are plastic garbage bags by an over that are melting. There is a big wood structure with long horizontal wooden pillars that move. It's a king-like structure: it seems to be made for a king.
