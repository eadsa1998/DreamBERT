I went home and Mom and Ezra were with me. Mom had cleaned my room and I was angry about it. The vacuum had picked up chicken? I locked up to leave and Mom was saying that I should leave it unlocked because Dad was inside. I went back in and he had cheese and crackers. He said he had to explain about them at something he was going to.
