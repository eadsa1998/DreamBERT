I dreamt I was walking across a bridge and just as I got across, the bridge fell in. I then kept walking along a road. Alongside were trees lining the road. I suddenly heard a tremendous thud, and when I turned around, a tree had fallen just behind me. I was walking along a road high above a ravine and just as I stepped around a curve, the road gave way behind me.
