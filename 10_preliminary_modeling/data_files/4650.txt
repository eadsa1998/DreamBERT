["The blind helping me find the bathroom."] I am walking down a graveled lane trying to get to my "room." Maybe I'm at a resort. I need to go to the bathroom. Mirabelle is walking with me. I tell her if we take the lane to the right that goes steeply uphill, we will find the accessible bathroom. She wants us to go to our accommodations first to put away the groceries. I need to pee, but agree. We get to our room. I go in. Mirabelle is outside still saying how happy she is to help me out. That's what friends are for. She asks me to hand her the salad on the counter. I look in the sink and see packages of bacon and hamburger. So I think this is supposed to be in the refridge. I look and see "keep refrigerated" on the bacon package. I carry them over and put them in the fridge. I see a few cut carrots and some lettuce on a plate and carry it to the patio door and look down (one story). A blind man (Steve) steps toward the window. I direct him verbally. Its 2 more feet, now there's a curb. He's going to also help me find the restroom.
