I was at home and there were zombies. Samantha, Calvin and Ezra were also there. Most of the windows had curtains over them. Ezra was watching TV. We were telling him to keep it down. There was a flashback of this little midget/leprechaun dude. He had snuck out of the house. I was in the laundry wondering about Dmitri. I heard a moan and I quickly ran to the family room with Calvin. He lay down on the floor and Samantha went out the back and then came back in. I tried to lock the back door but was having trouble. The zombies went to the back fridge and were hugging it. There was a newspaper and it said something about someone who had been learning to drive and the passenger had been killed. Then there were zombies at a school. There was a fridge. Someone died, who I think was Elijah, and we had the body still. Someone had gotten pregnant to a zombie.
