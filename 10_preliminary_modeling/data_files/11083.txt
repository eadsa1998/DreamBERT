There was a large group of us out in the field watching a boy ride a donkey he had just gotten. The donkey only had a halter on, but the boy was a good rider--made him run and buck. The donkey was very alert looking--had a face like my cat. We put him in the stable and went away--later I came back because I wanted to ride it secretly, and found he had grown much larger and was all bloated up from eating a pile of alfalfa that had been left in there. Boy surprised me by coming in. He was mad--thought cruel uncle had left alfalfa there on purpose. Uncle lived in house built way up in the air with dangerous steps leading up to it. He was keeping a man prisoner there by taking the man's glasses, because he (man) was almost blind and was afraid to go down the steps without his glasses. Uncle had party and man snuck out while it was going on and escaped.
