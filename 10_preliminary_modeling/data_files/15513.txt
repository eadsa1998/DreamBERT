I was watching the last season of How I Met Your Mother and it was as 12-parter with a huge budget. Barney woke up to their apartment being half blown up. He jumped into some water below and got electrocuted by a TV and made a 'shoot' joke. They said Ted's wife was Robin and saying 'just because you are gullible'. There were waves under the sea which had something to do with milk getting mixed. Later, Benjamin had a long rant about it. I think we were dating, but hadn't actually made it official. We kept saying 'moo' to each other. Gunnar had commented on some posts. Benjamin made a joke about some nudity saying 'if that doesn't get you off, you're on your own'. James posted too and said #17 was beautiful. Benjamin said 'Yeah, I kind of wish she was here with me now lol' and I was sad.
