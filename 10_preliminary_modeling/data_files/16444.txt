I was taking this music class on Saturdays from 10:00 to 11:00 at Westport College, and it was kind of put that way loosely because we could go whenever we wanted. And it was supposed to be so that it could be getting credit without actually interfering with the rest of my schedule. And so I went there and it was given by this man, this kind of older man, on this huge front porch of this building. It was almost like a stage that this class was given on. And there were like five or six people who were in a van and the rest of us who were just kind of like there. And I guess we were going to take turns being in the van or something. But he was telling us how when one person leads you have to follow them, and if they decide to do one thing or another, it's kind of disrespectful to ask them about it. It's really just the opposite. And so I think we did the Bruce Hornsby song that I've been listening to, I think that's just the way it is. And I wanted to talk to the guy, but the guy thought that I was coming over to criticize him, and he ran. And then I dreamt that my place where I was studying ethics was like up high on a cliff, and I was going to find a better place, but it was so hot. And I dreamt that Merrilee was involved in all this because she was kind of the music teacher's assistant, and they were holding this seminar on a Saturday, and they weren't sure who was coming. And I said I was coming, but I didn't know about anybody else. And that's pretty much it, I think.
