I was in a wide room, but the room was packed with assortments of furniture. There were blue colored slip covers on the furniture. There was a young lady who was sitting on the couch situated in the corner of the room near the doorway. I couldn't see her face. I could hear her voice and I could see her from the neck down. but everytime I tried to look at her face, the lights would darken making visibility poor. Then I saw an old high school classmate who kept telling me that I almost saw her. Then the dream ended.
