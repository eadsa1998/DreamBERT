I am in the M City House and looking out the pool room window at the little house. I notice it is very ornate, Victorian-like, and am surprised I don't remember it like that. I see two officials and two girl singers at the platform. The conference has begun. I go through a door to see the exhibit table. Things are all piled up. I start to spread things out so they can be seen. I try to make an attractive display. PR (marketing) is important. I notice flyers for my book and also discuss the need for a sign on the door since the door is kept shut and the speakers and singers of my organization are in there. Ellie tells me a story about Judy who is nearby listening. She (Ellie) says Judy had lots of affairs. Once she even put the picture of one of the guys on her dresser and she was still married to her husband. Judy wasn't very proud of that. She sits right in front of me as I am trying to watch the TV. I sit up and put my head resting on hers or over to the right side. We are very close. George gives me a necklace. I decide to use the beads to sell for the organization. I take the beads off the string. As I do so, Judy and I discuss how much to sell it for. She suggests $100/a pound. I say there's not very many pounds. "There's five pounds," she says. I say, "You should sell them by the beads. You'd make more." Then I see George nearby and feel embarrassed and hope he doesn't notice that I took his personal gift and broke it up to use for the organization. Judy points him out to me. I wonder if I'd done wrong, again, made an incorrect decision. When I was removing the beads and exclaimed, "There is even capro holders on this string." That was some kind of rare thing, a treasure.
