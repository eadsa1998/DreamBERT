Some people and I were in the woods and two girls and Jason Lee (except he had a munted face like Tom Cruise did in Vanilla Sky, but later he was Beaver from Dreamcatcher) went away from the rest and something happened and the two girls thought that they were "getting lucky" and they left to get their tops. They left and then Jason and I kissed and it turned out we'd been dating for a while. Then I was home around the pool and people were killing things.
