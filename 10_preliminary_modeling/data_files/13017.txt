We were driving to school. I was in the front. Eugene's car was behind us and he was sitting in the back. His brother Rodney and his father Abraham were in there too. Then Ezra and I were in the back and the car 'flipped' so that we were joined to their car by the front of the car. Rodney came into the car and was talking to Ezra. Then Eugene came and looked into the car from the front. He saw me and went a bit weird. He and Ezra were talking and I managed to join in the conversation and he was no longer uncomfortable. After school we were all walking home together. I did this flip and Eugene was like "What the hell?!" Mom told me to meet Janice off Nanovich Ave. Their mother was called Janice and their father was called Lionel. Eugene's house was number 74. The number was on the window. They were a couple of houses away from a video shop. There was a gambling place too and this black guy was guarding it. Ezra wanted to play.
