We were down in a summer camp for the blind, Mort and I and a whole bunch of other people. And for some reason we were supposed to go to someplace like Cube Island but we couldn't go because none of the vans was working. They'd all broken down, just like they did for real in 1988. I don't know how we resolved the problem in my dream.
