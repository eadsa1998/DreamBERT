I dreamed I was looking for a street called Sucre, in my car. I was with a classmate of mine (F). Though I went from place to place, we couldn't find it and at last we decided to go to La Punta. We went through a very long and narrow road. I couldn't look on the left side because the sea was there. It was a cliff. On the other side there was a mountain. We got to a store and my friend got out and went and bought some stockings, a sweater and a red purse.
