[1997-07-07] I was at my nephew John's birthday party. There were a bunch of little kids around, laughing, screaming, yelling and he was opening up his gifts. They opened up the gifts before the birthday cake because, he just was too anxious not to open the gifts first. Then we sang happy birthday and we had some birthday cake. We were out on the lawn of my brother and sister in law's house. Its a small yard but there was soft, green grass and there was enough room for all of us to sit down on the grass and eat the birthday cake. It was my favorite kind. It was chocolate cake with lots of rich, chocolate icing. My nephew got a present which he didn't like, it was a piece of jewelry and it was a heart pendant on a chain and he gave it to me and he said "Gee, why don't you take that you like to wear those." So I took it and tried it on and it was gold, it was very smooth, the chain was also very smooth with one of those little clasps on it, they call a lobster claw clasp that you open with your finger nail and slide the other clasp into it. I told him I would wear that all the time.
