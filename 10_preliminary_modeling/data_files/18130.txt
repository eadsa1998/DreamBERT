It was night, late twilight. It was in the mountains, and there was a high point from which you could stand and get a far view of the other mountains and trees and so on. I was up there with a couple of people who were strangers to me, a little older than I am. As you looked around from this vantage point, you looked down, you could see the earth, about 5 times larger than the moon usually looks, I guess, way down in a valley and not far off in the sky apparently, but very close. It was turning over and over, and it was mostly greenish and bluish, and it had a light flickering on it at various places shining off of it. It didn't seem strange to me that even though I was standing there, that I could see it down there, sort of floating in the air and turning around and moving along. My daughter got up there somehow  on top of this large sort of rock that I was standing on, and she is 14 months old, and she saw it and she wanted to get it. I had a hard time holding her back because if she would have crawled towards it, she would have fallen off the face of the rock. It wasn't exactly straight down, but she would have fallen.
