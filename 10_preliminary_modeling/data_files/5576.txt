[1997-05-23] I just remembered it was night time and I was in their backyard which you have to follow around on a sidewalk which runs from their backyard to the end. I was carrying a shopping bag full of garbage to put in the garbage barrel which was way up at the top, the end of the sidewalk, and I was walking up the sidewalk independently, I didn't need to use a dog or a cane or anything. I was bringing the garbage and yet somehow I had to go back to the house to get another bag, or put it in a plastic bag, so I was going the other way first, then I went back the other way towards the barrel.
