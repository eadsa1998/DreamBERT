I am going to go riding with Tyler and Jerome. They are on bikes. I'm on a motorbike. We go down steep stairs. Libby brings me some baskets. Co-worker Juliet is planning for the OCA conference and has brought knit dresses with markings and symbols on them so people can play interesting games. Someone brings in gifts for Libby and me, small corsages of flowers. I reach for one. It has a folded hankie on it (like the one Aunt Esther gave me when she died). I feel guilty that I reached for the best one and assure Libby I'm just looking. I see the letters POPP embroidered on one.
