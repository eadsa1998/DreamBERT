I was working in a very crowded office. It was absolutely awful. The whole floor was cubed up into these tiny spaces and they were trying to put as many people in each cube as they could. I just couldn't take it anymore. I was feeling clausterphobic big time and I knew I had to get out. Just walking to the elevator was a nightmare. So many people. <br/
