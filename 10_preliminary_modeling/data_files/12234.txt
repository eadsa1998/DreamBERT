There were aliens out the front of our house practicing stealing cars. They took Ezra, Mom and I and put us in this place with heaps of aliens. He let Mom and this alien go. We were in this place which looked like the back of a pub. But they didn't know that. We moved slightly and I said something like "This is gonna be a good night!". This guy came out and asked who said that. This girl said it was her. He didn't believe her and I walked away. He said something 'naughty' about my butt. I went to go to the toilet and he followed me. I ran out, but couldn't run fast enough. A girl had seen him before and got help. Gilbert was there.
