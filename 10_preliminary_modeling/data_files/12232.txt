George Harrison's car was in our driveway. I don't know if he was dead or alive. The car caught fire and we had twenty people from school sleeping in Ezra's room. Dad told me to wake them all and get them calm and out the back. I got them to the back door but then I went out and was getting the cats out and the rest ran off. Tinkerbell was back and I was cuddling her. Dad hadn't called the fire people.
