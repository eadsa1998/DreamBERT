Ezra had some disease. There were maggots. It came from ants. Snoopy was the one carrying it, so Dad went out and bashed him to death. Mom was trying to stop me going out there to stop him. Later this dude hit an animal and I discovered the car and then he got hit by a car. I got a needle in my foot? There were frogs and I was like 'Why are they here?". The lawn was prickly.
