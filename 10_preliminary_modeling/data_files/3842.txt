["My family destroyed."] I have returned from somewhere, maybe I have been at war. I am trying to connect with my family. I am walking down a long narrow hall with doors. I'd open a door and walk through, closing the door. Over and over and over. I get word from some man that my grandfather is now living with a General. He is having a homosexual affair. He is not interested in connecting with the family. Then I find out my "mother" is having an affair with some man and is gone. Then I find my little "sister," who is 13 years old and naked. I see her budding breasts. I am upset with her and try to talk her into getting clothes on. She laughs at me when I tell her that men come through this hall and some might rape her. She shouts out the word rape and laughs. I race down the hall, going back to find my grandfather. I open door after door and never find him.
