I woke up and saw a gate out the back was open (the house was different). Darren had three dogs and I didn't know what their names were. I had to put a chain on one of them. Later I asked Mom what their names were, they were Sam, Samson and Smith, and the first and last were girls. I was friends with a lesbian. For some reason we were lying in bed and she was naked. I can't really remember what was going on, but she was rubbing herself against me and I was kissing her bum/back area and bit in. Mom came in. She started calling me a lesbian and I shouted "I'm not a lesbian!".
