I'm in an acting class. One woman doesn't like me. I am trying to make some very colorful posters with pictures and ribbon. The top border ribbon is red and says "Mexico" on it. It looks plain and unfinished and I keep trying to make it change. Finally it is pretty. I get up on a ladder or some boxes that are off balance and I try to tie the poster to some nails. I have trouble. I use thumb tacks and have several in my mouth. Finally I get four or so of them up. The woman is angry at me because I succeeded and she didn't.
