I was at school. I had done a lab report but they didn't like my answer for one of the questions. Calvin was there and was going to copy, but I erased mine (there was something about a lion on there) and accidentally erased his too. I asked to go the library and the teacher said mine looked nice and she let us. There was a line to get in and everyone got checked.
