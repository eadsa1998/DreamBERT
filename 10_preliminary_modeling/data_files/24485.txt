I am in domestic setting. A large and powerful tiger eyes and tracks a furry pet cat. The cat attempts to dodge and escape the playful swipes of the tiger. It eventually runs up a tree but the tiger easily follows. The cat has no escape. On the ground it shows no fear as it continues to rebuff the powerful play of the tiger.
