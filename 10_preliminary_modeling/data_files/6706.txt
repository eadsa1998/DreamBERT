I was looking into a box and picked up a cape made up of peacock feathers which I stroked. It was so soft. It was about 3.5 feet long. I asked mother where it came from. She said it was part of father's Chinese costume but I couldn't remember him ever wearing it. There were also some poinciana flowers losing their petals also in the box and 2 or 3 other articles I didn't get to examine. It was getting dark and I wanted more light to write. 2 or 3 others wanted to read but the boy, J, in the center of the room didn't switch on the overhead light, only ineffective side lights. I grew impatient and went to switch at door, "Turn on this one." But when I did there was no light. He said that the company wasn't sending enough electricity. I couldn't understand.
