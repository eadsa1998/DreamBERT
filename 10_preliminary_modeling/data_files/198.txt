I'm with Lauren and Trisha, downtown, near the library - Trisha is getting a job downtown somewhere and we're talking about how we can go to lunch together. For practice we decide we'll go now, and Trisha suggests this one place that's in the Center. I propose that it's too far away, but she says there's good fast roads and the tollway you can get there by. So we go in her car and swing way out left of downtown (what would be west, since I'm looking north) and we go on some roads I don't recognize. The areas look like some other town, some much older town. There are some nice buildings here, and some nice-looking apartment buildings with vacancy signs - I'd like very much to investigate this. It would be a nice place to live. Somehow we end up not at a restaurant but at their (?) house. [It's a newer house than the one they live in, but still probably Fifties.] It's very reminiscent of houses we lived in (my family) when I was a kid, and there's not much furniture or stuff on the walls, as if they just moved in. (The light reminds me of the house in The suburbs.) [There was more after this: I think a cat was involved and something hanging on a doorknob, but it's gone now.]
