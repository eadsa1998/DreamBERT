My sister, my roommate and I all traveled to Germany together. We were in this very busy part of the country, like a downtown of a big city. We kept stopping at all the little stores. It was not a familiar place to me and I've never been to Germany, but I'm certain that that is where we were. We traveled through the city on some kind of vehicle that was kind of like a bike but it was very low to the ground and all three of us fit in it. The place where we sat in, it was more like a buggy or a big stroller. The places where we were going to were all very busy, but we never talked to anyone except for each other. Even between us though we were laughing more than we were talking. My roommate is a 20 year old female and is a very good friend of mine. My sister is 26 years old and we are also very close. Not much happened besides going to all of the shops and getting to each one from this vehicle. We did have some trouble getting up a hill one time and some young guys helped us out, but that was very vague.
