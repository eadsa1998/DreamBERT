This was sort of continued on from the last dream. We went to the old house because I had to get some stuff. Ezra was with me and he asked if I could drop him off at a roundabout to make it easier. I started at 11:30 AM and it was 10:10 AM. I started to panic so Mom came to get him. My hair wasn't straightened. I got my lab coat and there was heaps of stuff already in my bag. I left at about 10:20 AM. I was on the freeway which was different. It rained heavily and I have my wipers on. Cars were breaking a lot and it was peak hour etc. Up ahead I could see cops shining a light in all the cars. One stopped me and said to keep my radio on. I kept going and they said that a guy in a white Corvette was dangerous. The right lane was free and I saw him coming up. He sped passed and the cops followed. Everyone else sped up and followed too. He ended up getting out of his car and running. We all got out and some people chased him excitedly. A news crew were there and I watched them. I walked past and someone's shirt said 'Little Nemo'. I went to this shop and this guy was there next to me and he said his "Poppa" and I said 'oh, are you Greek?' and he said yeah. I said that I call mine Poppa too. He waved me off like 'what ever, I don't care'. He kept saying stuff like that he was better than me etc and I said 'yeah right'. I text Mom to ask if she heard anything about the guy from before. This cord got stuck under the guy in the shop and when I went to move it he got all spazzy and I yelled at him and said "I'll do it slowly if you don't trust me!". I went through some clothes at the shop. Eventually I got to University and I was early.
