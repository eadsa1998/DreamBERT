I was standing by the window in the living room looking down on the berry bushes, and suddenly acquired binocular telescopic vision. I zoomed into this big black spot I saw, and saw that it was a spider. But not a normal spider, NOOOOOOO. This spider was huge, first off. Maybe a foot across. Second, instead of having a globe shaped abdomen like normal spiders, it had a giant rectangular box. This disgusting thing was almost enough to wake me up. I drifted halfway up out of the dream (long enough to register the spider as a dream) and sank back down into it. Now a bee was crawling around in my right shoe. I was wearing my black boots, and the plastic toe shield had fallen off. I thought to myself, "Well, as long as I don't antagonize the bee, it'll be okay." I talk with my brother for a bit, and soon he asked me why I wasn't worried about the bee. I explained why, but no sooner had I finished, but the bee started stinging me over and over again on my fourth toe. I contracted my foot, to pull he tail off the bee, but I only succeeded in pulling the bee into my shoe. OH NO! Then I woke up.
