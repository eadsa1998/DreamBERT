My boyfriend Jeremy's mother coming in and finding me, since I slept at their house without permission.  I pretended to be sleeping and so she left, about to talk to Jeremy.  Jeremy came back in the room a bit later in a suit.  Then Jeremy was sick in the desert, and his mom found me in the corner, but we were both worried about Jeremy, so my being there wasn't a problem.
