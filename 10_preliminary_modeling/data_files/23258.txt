I am in Japan.  I have seen a bus come by in the shape of a water tower at a particular intersection, and by luck I am able to find my way back to that intersection, where I need to catch the bus.  At the corner where I think I should catch it there is a building called the Water Tower, but it isn't shaped like one.  Next door is a kind of arcade where bus tickets are sold.  All the signs are in Japanese, but there is a young Japanese woman (student age) at the entrance who speaks to me in English.  I'm not sure what she says, so I repeat, "Water Tower?"  She nods and takes me by the arm saying "Come with me."  "Hai." I respond.  She smiles and says, "You speak Japanese better than I do."  I laugh and say, "C'mon-only one word?  Gimme a break."  She takes me to a ticket booth.  The lady in the booth also speaks English, and tells me the fare is 30 cents.  I notice that there are a quarter and a dime on the floor.  I pick them up and put the quarter with a nickel from my pocket and give them to her.  The younger girl says, "Is it helpful to have someone who speaks English to help you?"  "It's wonderful," I respond.  "I can't think of another country in the world where you would get such service."  The lady at the booth tells me that I can pay the $10 airport tax there and save time when I leave.  At first I don't think I understand-it seems odd to pay the tax there-but I agree to do it.
