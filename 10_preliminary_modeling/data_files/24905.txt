I was Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz, and the Witch was chasing me around this pillar inside the castle. We kept going around and around for the longest time, but it was never repetitive at all. She never caught me. Setting: In the Witch's castle. Characters: Just the Witch, and my dog Toto. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, worried, hate. It's weird, because I haven't seen the Wizard of Oz for at least four years. I don't know why I had it.
