I went to some kind of an office or meeting space. I don't know why. But when I got there I realized that there was an all day conference going on and at each meeting time of the day there was only one session being held. I thought that was nice because you didn't have to choose between speakers. Jennifer K was one of the speakers. I had already missed the first couple of sessions because I didn't know this was going on. I wasn't registered so I think I went to find someone to see if I could still register. The building had a very long, very narrow hallway - barely room for more than one person in the hallway at a time. The ceiling was also very low - not much more than 6 feet. The walls and doors were all white and they had signs with very small lettering on each door to say what was going on each room.
