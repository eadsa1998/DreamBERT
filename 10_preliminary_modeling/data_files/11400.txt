My sister (19) and I are in an old dark tailor shop. I am explaining the alterations I would like to have made on a pair of pants. After this is done I walk down a flight of stairs. Suddenly I realize I am alone and go running back to see what has happened to my sister. She is sprawled out on the floor behind a counter apparently unconscious.
