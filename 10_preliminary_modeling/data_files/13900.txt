I was on an island. It was nighttime. First it was in a building and this lady got given a gun. Later a demon/dragon was on the island chasing us. I ran into the building and up the stairs to the top level. Selena was there and she got a gun. It was at the window and she shot it, but it was ok. I ended up on the roof, in a room, with it. It wanted these sheets and I had just enough and then it decided it wanted 1000 more. I tried to say we needed to call someone. Then it was a game and I was reading the guide. There were two options for this part, I could "romance it" or kill it.
