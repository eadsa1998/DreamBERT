I am a man, swimming in a river. There is danger. I swim and save Superman. We get to shore. Superman shoots arrows into the swarm of alligators that had been chasing us. He tells me I have been chosen to be the leader of a religion. I am to walk up a hill to my new temple and meet my bride. I do so but I'm uncertain. It's a steep hill and I find an old run down building. I guess it's not fancy because we are a primitive tribe and it's trying to blend in. The first floor is empty probably for meetings and dormitories. I go upstairs. It's the "church" part. On one wall is a row of small square windows letting in beams of light. The room is dark. I see the alter and feel great relief. The symbols of the god are similar to our tribal god. I go behind the alter and find a small crowded kitchen. A blond woman is working and I realize that is to be my bride. We are both embarrassed and kind of look each other over. An older woman is working too and she says she'll help out for awhile. I say, "Oh good and maybe you'll stay and do the work." She gives me an exasperated look and says, "I'm a woman and I do woman's work and I don't get paid. Everyone thinks I'll help out for free. I want to be paid." I say, "Oh, sorry! Sure."
