I dreamt that I was riding along in a big car, only it wasn't exactly a car. I was sitting in a big easy chair which had with it a long footrest. In the so called car with me was my aunt who was sitting in a chair similar to mine. Still another person was present. At one moment she resembled a classmate of mine, and yet the next moment she resembled no one T knew. I recall the sensation that we were driving over very flat and uninteresting country and that we all couldn't figure out why we didn't stop occasionally. Finally we stopped in front of a huge building of some kind, probably a gas station a little distorted. Everyone got out of the car but me, yet I recall I was the one who wanted to stop the most. Finally I was in the ladies room, the others having returned to the car. Right in the middle of the room, there was ?. big bed. I remember saying to myself that I mustn't lie down even for a minute because the others would worry. However, the next thing I remember was waking up with that awful feeling that they had gone without me, and that I couldn't comb my hair and that I was a wreck in general. At that moment I woke up.
