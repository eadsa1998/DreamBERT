I saw results paper. Water 14.90. John Tesar saw a car go by. He wrote the license number down on a piece of paper and was letting me know he was getting a hot tip. He wrote on the truck speed 10 mi. per hr. in Parma. Uncle Joe came into our kitchen. All he had on was underwear. I knew he was dead and I got the jitters. He walked over to Grandpa and bumped him with his rear twice. Grandpa just looked surprised. Audrey slapped Uncle Joe on the shoulder quite hard. Joe made a face as of pain, then he slapped Audrey real hard on her rear. She cried because it hurt. I walked with Joe and looked back. Grandpa walked off the porch and watched us in amazement. I was trying to fix a water leak in a pump.
