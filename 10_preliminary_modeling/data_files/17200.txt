Dreamt my good online friend Del came over last night.  Diddly-bopping until I said enough, let's get in bed to cuddle.  I did, and he was coming.  I moved my stuffed animals out of the bed to make room for him and just as he was about to lie down, the lights started flickering and sorting out.  We had to get up.  He disappeared and we were hosting a family.  Parents with a very young girl.  She was nervous.  She dribbled, threw up, excreted some sort of peach sauce.  They led her out of the room and she lost it in a hole in the floor, like where the posts go to block cars.   I talked to people in the hall regarding it, amused, and the hallways were like those of a theatre, fancy, and with mirrors.  At some point I was back in the dark room and I had to keep the little girl from getting lost in a dirt hole.
