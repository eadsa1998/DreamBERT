Bob and I were hunting. I shot at a rabbit and Bob shot at him when he was quite far. When he shot, the rabbit started to run and jump. His jumps were about 15 ft. high and he kept on running and jumping that high. I was going to put on my light on the car and the rod broke again. Bob and I worked on it. Finally he fixed it and pulled it again to put on the lights and it was broken again. I went to get a stovepipe and the man gave me one with a grating on it. I said this pipe is no good because the smoke and fumes will come out into the house. He looked at it and agreed, then he bawled his helper for giving me it.
