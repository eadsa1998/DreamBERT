I was in the mall at night.  I stopped in a clothing store as it was closing and was on the cell phone.  I turned around and walked the length of the mall.  I met my friend Ray and my online friend Starla at Fresh Choice.  They were only going to be open another half hour, but we still went in.  The food was harder to get- most of it was sitting on tables where people were eating.  There were some plate-sized cookies.  I ended up not taking much food.  Somehow after that, it turned into something else.  I was with my boyfriend Jeremy.  There was a small volcano, about 18 inches in diameter.  There was a sort of cardboard lining around the top that rotated.  There was some labeling on the edge of the volcano as well.  Rotating the top and climbing through the volcano was like a time portal.  The first one we went through, we appeared to be somewhere like inside a zoo.  It was a grassy field with animals around, but also a cyclone fence.  I tried some peacock calls, but we didn't feel safe and tried to leave quickly.  We readjusted the rim of the volcano to back to what we thought was home, but it was off slightly.  We appeared in a dim hallway.  At first we were compelled to go to the end of the hallway (perhaps told to?), but something was eerie.  We tried to hurry away.  Jeremy jumped in the mouth of the volcano and got sort of stuck, I was pushing his arms to get him to slide through.  Then a door off in front of us to the right creaked open.  I awoke feeling unsettled and uncomfortable being alone.
