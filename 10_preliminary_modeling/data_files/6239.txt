I was driving down Route 23 in my "dream car" (a 1979 Mustang [illegible]) and Stacy was beside me. We were going 85 mph as I looked at the speedometer. She had this look in her eyes -- a look of love and of passion. As I looked back to the speedometer we were going faster (100 mph). Then when I looked back at Stacy, she was driving and I was the passenger. We went faster and faster. Then I blacked out. I awoke to her shaking me, in her bed, and saying, "Oh please be all right . . . wake-up please." When I did I saw her beautiful face and then as she kissed me . . . I woke up.
