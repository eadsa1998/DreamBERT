I then stopped watching the movie type thing and came back into my character. I was walking through the inside of this house that was supposed to be an after-hours hangout for the media and political elite of the place. A place to network. I remember there were pictures from past events on the walls around the balcony of the multi-story townhouse (with carpet--I thought there should have been nicer wood floors); they showed men mixing with models, and there were also those career type young women in the bunch. I wondered if they resented the models, and if the models, wearing bright lipstick and tight clothes, resented the businesswomen, since they likely represented polar opposites of feminism. I came downstairs and talked to Andy Lewis, who was a pr flak who was on my side. I talked to him about a story idea I had that I wanted to pursue. Andy was a journalism friend from college who had a pr-ish nature about him. I then started talking to Kelly Newman, one of the young copy editors at the newspaper where I now work, who I get along with well and respect, about how we both agree that the stuff on this corporate structure handout being sent around is total bullshit. "I hate it when they create a bureaucracy that is supposed to approximate real life, but fails, and then they expect real life to conform to their bureaucracy."
