In a big theatre. I am watching an amateur show, supposed to be a college student night, but it turns finally into an ugly bright-colored cartoon. All of a sudden I remember I promised my aunt with whom I live here, to wait for her in front of the theatre. In haste, I rise and leave, disturbing people who mumble at me and run down the stairs, find her waiting outside. Together we enter the theatre again, sit down and watch the program. Soon it becomes boring and all the young people leave the theatre and walk by groups in a nearby park and boys and girls are wearing the costumes the actors had on for the stunt, initially. After a while everybody goes back to the theatre where a very lively ballet is given on the stage. Some people among the spectators say we missed a very good part of the program. Then we are discussing the program in the lobby and soon we are no more in the lobby but back in the park. It is summer in the park with leaves on the trees and it is warm. Outside on the street it is cold, and still winter.
