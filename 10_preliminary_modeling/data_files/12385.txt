We were at school, but it wasn't. I had sport. I had a hat. Calvin and I paired up. I had to go in this thing and I went down this hill that had a path. Ms Braun told us off. Then it was lunch time and we were standing with Elijah and Dmitri. I put something on their bench instead of ours, which wasn't our normal bench.
