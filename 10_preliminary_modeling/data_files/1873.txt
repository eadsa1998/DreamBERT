I am running down the halls of a zoo and I make a noise which causes the lions to roar, which causes the birds to chirp and screech, etc. until all the animals are making noises. Now I'm in trouble, so I run to a room to hide. Someone is after me. I go in and see a big monkey or gorilla. I try to entice a fake monkey (Dwight in a monkey suit) to sit on my lap so the real one won't. Too late. The big monkey comes at me.
