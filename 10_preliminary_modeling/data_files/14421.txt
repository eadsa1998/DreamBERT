There were races. I always won. This other girl, who was like my enemy, was annoyed about it. There was a big competition. We got to the place, which was in a big gym. Two girls hadn't come. I had a text from my enemy earlier, saying if you aim for 7th place, you would get a trophy. There were train tracks running through the gym. My mouth tasted like strong peppermint? I ignored it. A train came and I was told to get on it, so I did, which later, I realized the girl had tricked me so she could win. I didn't recognize the people on the train, and I asked about my teacher and I didn't know her name. She looked like Jenny Calendar (Buffy the Vampire Slayer). There was an earring phone. I called her and I said I'd been tricked to get a train. She I lost and I said 'yeah I noticed'. I said "races are about athletic ability and they cheated!". I got off the phone and called Mom to get me. She didn't want to drive that far. I found a train downtown, that skipped the Riverwalk and went straight to High Bridge (which in this case was after downtown going back home). I got on it and called Mom, she was breathing heavily and she told me to be quiet and I thought 'is she having sex?' and hung up. I got on a bus that was full of Asians. I had a text from the enemy girl and I was really angry. I told Ezra later and he said that it sucked. Ezra got a new DS and he showed Dad. The old one was really big and clunky. There was something about Clayton and Asians making stuff and slaves.
