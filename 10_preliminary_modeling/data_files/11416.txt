I found myself driving my car. I was leaving the neighborhood where a girl with whom I used to have dates (five years ago) lives. As I was turning the corner, I cut too sharply and ran into an old lady who was waiting at the curb for a bus. I backed up hurriedly, turned around on the front lawn of the closest house knocking down several little fences bordering the walk, and drove away from the scene. I later found myself in the garage at my mother's home. I was examining the inner-tube from the car and found that it had about six pair of evenly spaced nails in its side and each was completely forced into the tube to the head. Later I remember looking at the motor and found it to be a mess covered with heavy oil and grease. I was later pouring water into the opening for oil. I discovered my mistake and stopped pouring. At this point the dream ended.
