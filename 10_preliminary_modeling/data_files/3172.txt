I am a man who works too much, very responsible. A younger man is trying to convince me to hang out with him and have a bit of fun. I am sort of a policeman detective type person and am on a case. Just as the tiger lunges for me, I fire the shotgun in his mouth and he dies right next to me. The policeman comes and gives details of the case to his superior officer. Now I am he and wheeling down the sidewalk. The young man invites me to come to his commencement party. I say, "I can't, I have work to do." Then I say, "Oh, what the hell, why not?" and start to cross the street, against the light. I look to see if cars are coming; they aren't and I go. I see a dark sky to my left and ahead, a huge rainstorm. As I get to the other side of the street, the rains start. I hope I have my poncho to put on.
