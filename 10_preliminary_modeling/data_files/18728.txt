There was a big storm coming. The house was a huge open circle. Not a house but an open living space. In a donut shape. The hall went around in a circle. My space had no walls and I arranged the furniture in a trapezoid layout. ??? for right next to my space but I ignored it because it was not quite in my space. Around the circle before the storm hit, I looked at the art on the inner walls. Cartoon animals, most poorly done. Mine I did a good job on, though, and I liked them--but even the poorly done animals had a very endearing quality. Stephen was waiting at one spot. Our eyes met and he screamed, "What?" and I went underwater and swam away. Undercover cops were walking on the FDR Drive with walkie talkies, trying to catch a hoodlum.
