I dreamt I was in some confined space...No bigger than the back of my boyfriend Jeremy's truck.  I think my high school classmate Trina, for some reason.  I know my mother's friend Peggy was, as was her daughter Kate.  They had rented a sort of spa.  I had a sound system.  I got a chance to use the spa too.  Kate wondered something about my cords.
