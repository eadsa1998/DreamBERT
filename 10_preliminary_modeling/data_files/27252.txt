All I could remember of this dream seems to be very scant. I was riding on a horse in the woods. I was conscious of the green grass and the brown bark of the brown trees. After trotting for a few minutes the horse threw me off his back. I was very frightened and yelled. Before I could do anything else, the horse began to chew my hand. It was very sinister to watch him gnaw at the bones. I woke up as he had chewed half my hand.
