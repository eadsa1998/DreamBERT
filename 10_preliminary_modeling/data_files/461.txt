I was with a male friend flying a jet plane and landing it, because something was wrong with the plane. He wasn't supposed to be landing his plane. I felt that he wasn't supposed to be in my dream. Then I was with my boyfriend and we were walking around outside in a park, when we saw a mother with her two children holding pictures of my boyfriend playing soccer. The unusual thing about this scene was the pictures were in motion like a video picture. The baby was controlling the speed at which the video was going and my boyfriend was acting extremely goofy in the pictures with his soccer buddies. Then we went downtown and I was supposed to meet him at a bar. Then all of a sudden he came into the bar I was in with a girl with long blonde hair. She was allover him and he looked like he was enjoying it. Then I came over and he left her at once to be with me.
