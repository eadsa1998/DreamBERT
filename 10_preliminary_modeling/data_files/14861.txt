There was a movie called Ghost Ship. This kid kept seeing a ghost of a boy, who had his front two teeth missing, white skin and black stuff around his eyes. He eventually told him to go away and the ghost was annoyed. Then someone and I went on a boat. This doctor guy from the movie and a woman picked up something and they said it was ok and put it down. I read something later about this father who abused his son. The son was found dead in the ocean and had the same look as the ghost kid in the movie. I was telling Mom about it and said it was creepy. Ezra, Jayson and I were hanging out. Nana gave us books to learn different languages though they were Greek books. One of the words was "2duvduv". We watched some Greek movie on TV called Skillis and it was a comedy. We got bored quickly and started watching a 60's movie. There was weird tension between Jayson and I and I was 19.
