I had a dream last night that started out as the absolute worst nightmare I have ever had, but it was a nightmare within my dream, so that when I woke up from the nightmare, I was still in my dream. In my nightmare, I was a mule for carrying drugs across the border to Turkey, Iraq, Kazakhstan, and Israel. There was this horrible, creepy, oily, and disgusting man in his 40s, who was my boss/drug lord/drug dealer. The drugs were some weird form of cocaine and ecstasy in this red and black pill that I hid under my breasts. In order to get across the border, my boss would pretend to be fondling me while he took the drugs out. I was crying the entire time, weeping, sobbing, and doing anything to get out of it. I ran into Kingston once when I was about to leave Kazakhstan to get more drugs. I made the most helpless, pleading face, and he got the point and saved me. He grabbed me and sprinted me across the border, where the guy couldn't bother me anymore. I was so relieved that I started crying and shaking and sweating, and I'm pretty sure that was happening in real life as I woke up from my nightmare into my dream. Next, I had a dream that I was studying Michelangelo's sketches for the Sistine Chapel ceiling. The original for The Creation of Adam was not the iconic image of Adam reaching out to God, but rather a sketchy cartoon of God holding Adam as if he were giving him the Heimlich maneuver. I was confused because I know the real version so well, but apparently this was a sketch that no one had ever seen before and was the real creation scene.
