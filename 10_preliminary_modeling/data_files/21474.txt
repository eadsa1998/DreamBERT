I was lying on the floor. A lady came by. She lay on top of me and I intimated her. I sat in the house and looked on the porch. A chair moved up off the floor and I commanded it to stop in mid air and it did. Then I commanded it go near the ceiling and it did. Then my sister Ann was standing on the porch. I commanded she go up off the floor. She did, then I commanded her to stop in mid air and she did. I made her body go near the ceiling, and it did. I made her body turn in mid air and it did. There were two doctors taking blood or draining blood out of each other. They had a cavity in their hands and had tubes to drain the blood out and it made me nervous to see them spill the blood into the sink.
