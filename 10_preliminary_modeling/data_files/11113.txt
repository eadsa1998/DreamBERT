On a shopping trip my mother and I were going to buy a hat for my niece. I asked her size and it was 4. (She is now 10 years old.) After looking at a pink jacket and hat which was dirty, we went across the street to another store. Sonja, my niece, ran ahead. When mother and I got there, she had already picked out her hat and had it in a bag. As we were going in the store, I told mother that a natural straw would be nice with Sonja's coat which was bright green and I pointed out just such a hat. Sonja put on her chosen hat which was an ugly shade of green with a bonnet brim trimmed with brown ribbon. She was determined to have it so we got it. When we went to the car, we had other packages. I was afraid to have my sister see Sonja's hat because it looked terrible with the coat.
