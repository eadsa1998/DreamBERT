We are celebrating Zena's birthday party in the dream she is 5 years old; (really = 18) She runs around with balloons. I want to take her and her friends to the zoo, but Frank is too busy and disappears into a bookstore. I am angry at him. No one else can drive us to the zoo, so the kids just play at our house; OK and not angry anymore.
