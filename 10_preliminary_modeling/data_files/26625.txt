 I'm in a gymnasium where Australian people are playing basketball. I ask a man about the rules for three-point shots and slam dunks, if there are any. I easily touch the large rim here. My housemate Chase Unter and his friend Luke are playing on a team in an intramural-like league. My team plays soon. Michael Jordan is on my team. I'm very rusty and stiff as I take off my green and black warm-up pants, put on my shoes, and pull up my long socks. Michael comes over to me and kneels down next to me, to psych me up before our game. He says he is ready for me, which I think is encouragement. I say the game will be fun. I think I'll be able to play and well and my skills will allow me to dominate the other team, even though I haven't played in a while. Two acquaintances of mine, Jay and Troy, are there. Jay's bladder has somehow moved up to his neck area. Eh hasn't been able to urinate for days, and relieves himself by vomiting. I tell him that is serious and he could easily die: he should see a doctor now! He and Troy think he'll be okay until he gets back to the United States, and then he'll get it checked out. The other basketball team we're playing includes Randy Zadra. I'm the tallest player on both teams. Michael Jordan is a referee. I take my wad of gum out of my mouth; it has peppermint in it. I get a drink for as long as I can. The game is about to start. I'm really out of shape, but have the mindset that I can beat the other players.
