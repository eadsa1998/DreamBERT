[3rd dream] At some party. Father in next room is taken ill. Mother and another woman go to him. R says J and I will take the car and go home and send one back for the others. I start to pick up the mess and pack. Begin winding strands of tinsel on cardboard. Find a dilapidated rabbit on which I wind the thick strands and on another card the narrow ones and we pack the other things. Now I can't find the tinsel. Could someone have taken it?
