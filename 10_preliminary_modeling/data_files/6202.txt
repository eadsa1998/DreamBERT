My second dream included one of my biggest fears: sharks. I can only remember few details and therefore the end of the dream is quite distorted. The setting takes place on the water. I was accompanied by a "mother-figure" in her late thirties. Also, there were approximately four kids with us. The scary part occurs when a shark (the same shark from "Jaws" the movie) eats one of the kids. The rest of us jump on the closest dock for our protection and safety. The setting suddenly shifts from the dock to the cafeteria of Camp Shalom. (I attended Camp Shalom when I was a youngster.) There were townspeople from Orange Springs, Florida in the cafeteria when we arrived. It turns out that the townspeople knew about our tragedy but refused to believe us. I responded in an angry and anxious manner and then I woke up.
