["Stealing pretty things."] A man is working on some project involving little bits of things. A woman owns the store he is getting the bits from. He gives me some to make something with. I go outside and accidentally drop them. The scatter in a trail of tiny bits across the grass. I try and pick them up. They are colorful. Odd shapes. I also pick up some nicer ones like stones carved into animal shapes that I know must belong to the owner. I pick some of those up too. I like them. I feel a bit guilty. I should give them back to her. I go back into the store. She watches closely. I'm pretty sure she sees I have some of her things.
