The guy that I have been dating was standing in his room naked with one of his housemates who is a girl, and someone whom he has previously slept with. She was lying on the floor, also naked. I walked into the room and as I saw them, they both told me not to worry, that nothing was going on. I believed them and said, "OK," and walked out of the room.
