[1997-05-01] I was at a spiritual retreat weekend and there was a bunch of us sitting around a living room with comfortable chairs and soft rugs and having a relaxed discussion about our feelings and thoughts we were having and the character, Andrew the Angel of Death from the TV show "Touched by an Angel" appeared I asked him what he was doing here, he was supposed to be on the TV show and he told me he was here for me. I tried to deny him, telling him he wasn't supposed to be here and that I wasn't ready to go home yet. He said "well, touch your face." On my face were these soft, squishy things like soft pimples but they were very sore and they started to spread all over and he said "you're not going to be with us long." And I happened to hear my mother's voice saying she's dying. And I said, "this isn't fair and if you're going to do this you'll have to take care of Sammy my guide dog and make sure she gets back to my family because I don't want her to be abandoned. And he said he would and I said then it's okay to take me.
