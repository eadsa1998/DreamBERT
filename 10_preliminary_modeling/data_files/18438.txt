I recall some things about the setting, but little about the action. Setting is in a wooded area with a lake as the central point. I and my companions seem to be Egyptians, ancient Egyptians, and the time is way back in ancient Egypt. We are barefooted and wear headdresses, and occasionally seem to have some primitive weapons: spears, swords, etc. The Romans seem to be here as conquerors, but we are carrying on some kind of underground resistance activity. Several times some small (about 1 to 2' across) discs whirl across the lake and sky. At one point I hold and examine one of them. Each half of the disc is cone-shaped. One side is black with a white crescent design running thru the center. The other side is black with white, red, and yellow stripe-crescent designs on it. The view of them as they whirl through the air (power source unknown) is very impressive, for they spin. Most of my activity seems to involve slipping into the dark, shady part of the woods on the other side of the lake. Day Residue: only thing at all relevant is that I was painting last night, and the first color used was black against a white background.
