Blackson had a mask or bust. Several of us from the office stepped on to an elevator to go up. Next we were in a room containing several cabinets. One drawer of one of the cabinets was pulled out and Blackson raised his foot as if to step into this drawer. Chester calls out to him to stop. We examine contents. One item is a map of the United States with shiny, metallic (silvery) dots marking each cave which has been visited by collectors of cave insects. Chester states that Valentine was the second noteworthy cave explorer of this country -- that is, second in time, not necessarily in excellence or ability. (His predecessor was not named.) The dots extend from coast to coast in the southern part of country and up both coasts. In the same drawer was a similarly spotted map, this one a relief map, black in color, and smaller than the other one.
