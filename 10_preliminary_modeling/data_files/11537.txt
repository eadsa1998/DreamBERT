It started in the afternoon of a very important day to me. There was a big formal dance going on this night. I went to the garage to get the car and when I tried to start the car nothing happened. I looked under the hood and the motor was missing. What a surprise. I called my uncle and told him what happened -- 'someone has stolen the motor out of the car.' We looked around the garage for clues and found the motor in a vacant lot next to the garage. It had been taken apart and scattered all around. It took us two days to put it together.
