There were two sets of brother and sister. I think their parents were married. One of them was Adam Baldwin (and he looked like he does in Chuck). Then they rebelled against their parents. So the parents called the opposite set of children and came up with a plan. What was supposed to happen was someone would 'kidnap' the kids, but then the mother changed it so the father would be kidnapped too. There was sloppy food to fee them with and some others and I had to shove it in their mouths. The father wouldn't open his mouth. I kept shoving the spoon into his mouth and he eventually opened and chewed and spat it out. Then I was at a house, which I think was home. Mom had called this babysitter lady. We had mattresses on the floor and everyone was sleeping (all the kidnapped people). Rover was on the lounge. I saw the babysitters car pull up and Mom answered the door and said we didn't need her and she asked "oh, you found the puppies?" and she said "yes". But she came in anyway and had a baby with her. We were trying to get rid of her. I also saw a cop car drive by.
