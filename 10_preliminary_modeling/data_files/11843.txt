I was at the shops with The Young Ones but it was the actors, except Nigel Planer had had an accident and was in hospital, so Neil was there instead because we knew both. I think we were going out or something. We were walking with food and we tried to walk across this bar but we all fell off and said we can never get across. We all went and sat down at a table and there was a special day coming up and I was going to take Neil there because, actually I don't know, but he said "Oh, you can't take me because you're getting married to Nigel" and really quickly I was like "We're not getting married". Then I realized I was in love with Neil.
