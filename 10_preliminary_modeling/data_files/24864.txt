I was putting on my makeup and I was just about finished when suddenly it all turned into mud. I went to wash it off but it wouldn't come off. Setting: In my room and bathroom. Characters: Just me! Feelings and Thoughts: Scared. I woke up scared, I hadn't realized it had been a dream yet, so I thought I still had mud all over my face.
