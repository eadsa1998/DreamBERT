Am sitting on a curb in front of my car. A man approaches walking softly alongside car. He stops in front of me and I look up and realize he is threatening me with hand in jacket pocket which appears to hold a gun. I then realize I have seen him before and with another man. As I realize this, I stand up and am immediately aware of that other man now standing behind me, also threatening with hand in pocket. I walk away and then they follow closely behind. I turn quickly and grab both their pockets, one with each hand and twist them away so they cannot shoot at me.
