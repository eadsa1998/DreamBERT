I visit the C. dept at a meeting and don't see many people I know. I sit on a couch next to a black man who has a stop watch. He puts it on my lap and says, "Is that OK?" I say ok. Then it stops. He picks it up and restarts it. It stops again. He lays it aside. I get up and walk around. There are large appliances I crawl around on like I was kid size and they were adult size. The black man and I are teasing each other, playing like kids. He turns on a switch and a sound like a blender whirs. It gets annoying and I climb down from the top of the refridge and get footing on the toilet cover and go over and turn off the switch. The black man lays on the floor laughing. Then I hear a buzzing sound and finally figure out it is a telephone thing and pick it up, the black receiver, and I hear a male voice, like my father's. He says something and says, "Tell Willis to come to the V's, you know, like our way. And tell LoKey Junior." I write his name down, not knowing who that is.
