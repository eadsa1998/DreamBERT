There was a party being held in my honor in the basement of my birth home. There were quite a few people there. It was somewhat crowded. I was in the middle of a conversation or doing something with someone else when Ben D came in. I may have been playing a game of some sort. I was pleasantly surprised to see him and wanted very much to greet him immediately but knew that I had to finish whatever it was that I was involved in. As time passed, I kept watching him interacting with others and wishing it were me. I began to fear that he would leave before I had an opportunity to talk with him. Something happened that had put me in danger. Some of the people in attendance were discussing this and trying to figure out what to do. It seems that mostly they were afraid to do anything. About that time, I noticed that Ben D had crawled into a small, dark opening above the gas tank. [Huge horizontal gas tank people used to use to heat their homes.] I realized that he was preparing to attack the person who was trying to harm me. I overheard someone talking about some physical skill he has that he was intending to use to do this. I was surprised and impressed about this skill, but also flattered that he would make this effort to protect me. Ben D and I spent an entire day together, just doing ordinary things. We both had such a nice time. I knew I would like to do this many, many more times, but wouldn't allow myself to even think about that because I knew it would never happen.
