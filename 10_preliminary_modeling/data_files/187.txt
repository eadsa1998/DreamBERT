I'm in a garage with a girlfriend; we've just been out somewhere and are going back through town, stopping here to get the car worked on or something, and we're still in very jolly spirits (it was a fun outing) and poking around in this garage. She's looking out the window at the street and turns back to tell me she's just seen this good-looking guy that I was drooling over at wherever-we've-been, go into a store across the street! She teases me about it, saying I should go talk to him, and I'm thinking about it. In the meantime [something we do causes a big oil spill on the floor of the garage, and the men who work here come back from outside and are not happy about it.] Still, we're very lighthearted and girlish, giggling over the boy.
