I was dreaming I was eating butter and I awoke and was going to write butter for a horse. Ann and I were in bed and I noticed our door open. I got up and pushed brother Steve out. Hew as like a spook. I pushed him off the porch and he disappeared. I was driving on a rough road and was it rough. Then it turned narrow. I saw a male and female horse trying intimate. The male put down a young colt. Was he small. Hiney hung on to my legs as I flew so I came down slowly. I had a gun and we were playing shooting. I shot the air rifle and tried to shoot a horse, but the b-b didn't carry to him. Grandma drove my car and she didn't step on the brake to stop it. She just let it coast till it stopped. Mary started to yell at a lady she thought was Grandma and the neighbors laughed at her. A fellow Joe I know came towards me with a pint of whiskey. The bottle was large. When he got near, he looked at me thru the bottle and I could see his eyes.
