A large house. I notice I'd been only living in a few of the rooms and have many empty rooms I can expand into. I could have an art room, a writing room, a music room. I am having a good time finding furniture to move into these empty rooms. I choose to take the breakfast things out to a table on an outdoor landing. It will be pleasant and unusual. Ginny is there.
