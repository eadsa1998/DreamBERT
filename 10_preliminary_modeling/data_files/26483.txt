 My friend Stephen Ramos has defecated in a toilet and not flushed the toilet. I see my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas going to take a shower. I hear her thoughts as if she is speaking them. Something happens with her and keys. Some people are having dinner, which may be at my dad's house. I enter my room. There are small black pellets of ant feces covering my bed. There are ants everywhere! They are on my bed and on my bookshelf, which is the old wooden shelf grandpa Redding made for me. I'm disgusted and frightened by this. I'm going to go out and buy a lot of ant traps. I wrap my hand in some cloth to try to kill some of the insects by smashing them. There is a queen ant and a nest-like area. Upon awakening, I realize that the ants in my dream look like spiders look, but I know them as ants.
