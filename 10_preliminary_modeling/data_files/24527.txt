It's morning. I'm in a large rundown hotel room which is part of a single story complex in a rundown area. A bad smell starts to permeate the room. I open the door. Outside, my mother is washing the floor with ammonia. I yell at her.  I say, "That's ammonia. It's coming into my room. What are you doing? Why didn't you tell me?" I try to stop her. We begin to fight. She hits me in the legs with the mop. She yells, "Get out." My brother appears. We move toward each other aggressively. We're both angry and willing to fight. I say to him, "Don't do it. Don't do it." Just before we're about to fight he backs off and I leave.
