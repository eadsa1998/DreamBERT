I went back to the cabin in Castle Valley, Utah [where I lived with Lynn just before it all ended].  I don't remember any details, just I was back.  I think I was excited, happy, or anxious about being back.  I only remembered this dream later because during the dream I remembered that Mom had recently had a dream about going back to that cabin.
