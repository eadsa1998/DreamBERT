["God Chooses Me"]  I am in a huge mansion on the edge of a high cliff that drops straight down to the ocean. I feel a small shake of an earthquake. For awhile, there are only occasional small shakes, but it builds up to a nasty earthquake. I look out the window worried the house will fall off the cliff and smash into the ocean. I hear a huge crash and see that a big wave came up and broke the window on the other wall. I decide it is time to pack and leave. I think about what I should pack. What is most essential. I get my pills. Then I remember my writing and pack some of that. I find some clothes on the floor and my toothbrush. I am fairly calm and moving slowly even though the earthquake continues. Now I look up at the ceiling in time to see a tidal wave entirely engulf the house. Now I am scared and hurry. Howard comes in. We say hi and I continue rushing to pack. He leaves. Suddenly I look out the window on the ocean side again and see a tall dark figure floating toward me. It has black plastic armor on and a long black lance. The pointed end of it is coming straight at me. I realize this is God and he is choosing me for something. Now I realize I have been chosen to coordinate the writers. I gather up the empty writing books to give to the writers as they arrive. They slowly trickle in. I give each one their book. I pick up a letter Howard sent me. It begins with the word "Honey." He describes the new building he moved into. Brick with marking of circles and squares on each window. An old high school friend comes in. I find his old high school writing book and give it to him. I say he can choose to finish the stuff he started, or write new stuff. We chat about the days when we were in a writing group together. He said collaboration with me was really good. The other group member, Mary was OK, but not like we were together as a writing team.
