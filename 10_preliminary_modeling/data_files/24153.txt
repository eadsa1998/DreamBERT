This dream was in a school setting. I was in some sort of assembly. The assembly was because of some sort of theft that had taken place. I think it was stolen diamonds or something, Anyway, I was sitting there, knowing I was involved and trying to figure out what to do. I knew my fellow partners were in the room as well, so I was afraid to look at them for fear we would be caught. The speaker was threatening and seemed to allude to the fact that they knew who had done it... as in one person. The last thing I remember was walking out and glancing at my partners in crime. The funny thing is that after I woke up I was still trying to actually come up with a plan about what to do.
