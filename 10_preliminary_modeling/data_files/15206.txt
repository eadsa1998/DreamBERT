I was out with this guy and a couple. We are at a shop. There was like a party on and one section was all lit up but the rest of the shop was dark. This other guy was following me. I went off to the stationery section which was dark. He was talking to me and seemed nervous and friendly. I think he was a security guard. He walked away, but then he ran over and grabbed my arms. He was strong and pushed me to the ground to rape me and I screamed loudly and high pitched and he let me go. I had gotten changed a while back and was looking for my old clothes. Eventually the shop closed and it was just me and my friends there. It was now totally dark. The party was illegal/not allowed and there was one security guard outside who we had to avoid. We ran out to the car and the alarm went off. Their car wouldn't unlock so we got into mine and I drove off. Later, I was playing Frontierville and the 'Gold Rush' had opened. I started clearing stuff and there were some crops already planted. Jeremiah had helped out and I was like 'oh, that's why he hasn't been leveling up' (because there was a separate leveling system on 'Gold Rush' and he had been playing there instead).
