A young Native American boy has a father in a wheelchair and he likes a beautiful young girl from a rich family. I am an older woman attracted to him. He has a quick mind and I am encouraging him to realize what is happening around him, what is the metaphor of the girl, the bully and the bad father. He tells me what he thinks it is. I agree. Later he says, "No, it really was this," and I say, "Yes, but it's really all the same, just a different way of looking at it."
