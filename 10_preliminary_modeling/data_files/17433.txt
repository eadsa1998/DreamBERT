I was outside.  A group of guys started to pick on me, telling me to do something because of something I'd said just prior.  I was about to comply when I thought, no, it wasn't right.  I wanted to fight.  Moving then became difficult.  Somehow, with focus, determination, will, I was able to move.  I kicked one in the head, knocked him out.  While down, I bashed out their teeth with a rock, to keep them down, to show them who's boss.
