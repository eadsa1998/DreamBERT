Benjamin came to university with me one day and I had to organise stuff. Someone took a photo of me as I looked up and around and it was a weird picture of my neck. There was a cheese camera and I was confused as to what it was and Benjamin was annoyed and said 'a camera wrapped in cheese' and I wondered why he was so angry. We went to the cinema with Dad and Ezra. Benjamin was fine with them but was angry with me for some reason.
