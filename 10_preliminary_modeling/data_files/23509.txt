I am living on an island, going out and socializing a lot. There are all sorts of parties on the island, and big expensive houses all lit up with Christmas lights. A very festive, rich scene. I keep going to one house with a metal automatic gate (but I can just push the button and go in). The house is split into different apartments. In the front is an artistically sophisticated part with three rooms, all open to each other, exquisite art, very neat and clean. It is a meditation center, with the main room adorned with beautiful pillows and chimes. As I pass through, there are 12 people meditating and chanting there. I tiptoe, as if hoping not to be noticed. The back apartment I see only from the backyard as I look through the windows. Although I am standing there in full view, they pay no attention to me. They are two men lovingly caring for two kids, everywhere are toys, playthings, pajamas -- a child-oriented world. As I look through the window, one man is laughing with and reading to a small girl looking at her with so much love it makes my heart break. The other man comes up to them on the loft bed they are on and is strangely a big kid -- a child in a man's body. He goo's and gahs over their shoulders at the book, but his appearance is about 50 years old.
