I was winding my watch when all of a sudden it clicked and I could hear the whirring noise made by the spring inside the watch as it unwound itself. I felt very badly because I had overwound the watch. I waited a while and then just wound it once and it seemed to work all right again. Then I noticed that it was ticking as it should and the hands indicating minutes and hours were going in the right direction, but, to my horror, the second hand was going counter-clockwise. At this point it was no longer my watch I was observing, but instead, I seemed to be holding a stop watch.
