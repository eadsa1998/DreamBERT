I went into some building adjoining our house with Judy. I was looking for something when May Schneider came in. I said, "Hello, May." She said, "How are you, John?" I said, "Wonderful." I said, "Come here, May." She did and we got behind a partition from Judy's view. I put my arms around her, hugged and kissed her and then I picked up her skirt and she said no. I said, "I won't hurt you." I was ready to intimate her when my wife came in, but didn't see what I was going to do. I quickly opened a door to another room and there was an old tricycle there among some old junk. I said to may maybe she would like that old bike, just faking it, and May said, "I will tell her and she may buy it." So I got out of a tough pinch. Then we were on the lawn and there was a limb from a thorny tree on the lawn. I broke it in two and threw one part on Lattimer's lawn and the other one across the other side and this one landed on one end and stuck in the ground and sort of shipped over and hit a dog. The master looked at the dog's eye, but he seemed to be okay. He said nothing. I saw Mr. Garchew, a name of a horse. I was in Rivertown drawing coke. I went inside the of the coke oven and got all of the coke out from the rear of the oven.
