I had a dream that I was in this hall and it was almost empty. All the tables were empty except for a few people. music was still playing and my friend Wayne was there with me. He says to me, "I'm gonna dance to the 'Rockin' Robin' song." He started dancing and lip-syncing the song. I watched for a little bit and then left. Then I was in a big truck, driving with my youngest sister. It was weird because the steering wheel was on the right hand side. My sister was sitting very close to me and I asked her why she was. Then I asked her to move over. There were two guys in a car ahead of us and we were chasing them. They tried to lose us. Then I was at my friend George's work. He asked me to dilute this drink that he had. It was brownish-orange. I went over to the sink and started to dilute it. I noticed I was putting hot water in the drink, so I dumped some of it out and poured in cold water up to the top. I gave it to him and he was like, "This is VERY diluted." I said, "Well, I'm the daughter of a science teacher; when you ask me to dilute, I dilute." Then I woke up.
