I was sitting in our living room reading a magazine when I heard an unusual noise outside. So I went to the door and looked out. There was our dog fighting with another dog which was twice her size. Something had to be done to save our pet, yet I didn't quite know what to do. However, I rushed over to the two dogs and finally separated them with a stick. Then I took M--- back into the house and tried to comfort her.
