I was sitting on the steps in a huge fancy mansion-like building- it belonged to me and  my boyfriend Jeremy.  I had to go to the bathroom and was standing next to porcelain inlets in the wall.  I tried going there.  When I moved, I'd missed, but orange soda was leaking down from the ceiling.    We went upstairs.  Movie theatres surrounded a statue in the middle.  We looked around trying to find a movie we wanted to watch.  It was no longer Jeremy, but my best friend Emma.
