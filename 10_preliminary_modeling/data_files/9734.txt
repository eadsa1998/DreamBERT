Walk with Frank by the seaside: we are looking for rocks that glitter; he goes to Church with me and we sit together: Fr. James celebrates the liturgy in the side chapel; Frank says: Baptists don't need to make so many gestures or the sign of the cross; then it is quiet and a bird comes out and sits on my hand; then Fr. James talks to us how no one cooperates with him; he wants to help me to go fishing, but not enough tackle; see fish hooks on floor, not used.
