I dreamed that my father bought a very beautiful house. I might have had this dream because my parents are thinking of buying a house. The house was big and it had a huge garden. In the middle there was an "S-shaped" swimming pool. The house also had many rooms and I occupied one which had a living room next to the bedroom. The furniture in the living room was classical and there was a record player and I spent the time listening to records or swimming in the pool.
