I looked at the clock; almost 10 a.m. Must have slept after I woke at 4 a.m. Why did not they wake me? Then mother came in and I asked her if it was really 10 a.m. She said it was. I said at the Home they always came around knocking at each door to wake us. Probably I was used to that so hadn't wakened. I was nearly dressed now and asked if I could help her. Something said about bathrooms, several in this large house but I had my own. Yet I went to another and started to wash my hands but the bowl was dirty and toilet not flushed. So carrying my soap, I went to another. Came back and tossed soap into the basin. Saw father there and started to help sister with several cartons of various materials but when I left one off she told me that wasn't the one. Then she snatched up an apron for me to wear.
