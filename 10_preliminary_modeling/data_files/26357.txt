 I'm in a group of people, in my room at home. Two men my age fight with me. One of them is my cousin Archie Weber. The other person is a combination of my brother Wally, housemate Stephen Ramos, or uncle Gary Redding. I fight these two men at the same time, punching. We roll onto the floor, over a submarine sandwich from Subway. The sandwich is mine. People gang up on me and hold me down. Others people drop hot green peppers on me, and in my mouth. I spit them out. I struggle and thrash, trying to break free. I break free, and I beat the shit out of each of the two men, one by one. I punch each one repeatedly in the nose and face until they can't make sense and the world is groggy to them. Some women are in the room.
