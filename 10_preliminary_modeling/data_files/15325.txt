I went for a drive with Ezra. We drove past a weird abandoned school and kids were in there. We went in and it was a game. We had to escape the kids and find the exit. We were outside and threw something that hit the wall and it bounced off and hit my car. Something got swung around? We went to my car and it was near a big round desk.
