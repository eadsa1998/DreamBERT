 I'm in a class of kindergarten-age kids being taught by my third grade teacher Liza Minikel. I am my current age (21) and size. It is mid-quarter time, and all the kids have evaluations. I got a "D" on one aspect of my evaluation. The kids can respond to the evaluations by communicating in pictures. I think of drawing a hand with the middle finger sticking up, flipping off the evaluator, as well of other ways of protesting my low score. I comment on Liza's accent, saying it sounds better than it will seven years from now, which is the time I am from in the future, and I know from having heard her accent then. The kids giggle and comment at this, suggesting that I have sexual intentions. I'm slightly embarrassed, but shake it off, literally and figuratively. I may be drinking a beer.
