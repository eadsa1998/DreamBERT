There were frame structures held together by bolts. One of the sections came loose and caused the others to lean. I told a man who was with me that the bolts have to be tightened. Later I wanted to oil a printing press. A man was sitting on the press. He said to pour the oil into his mouth through a funnel. I did so, and he became ill.
