I was at this market, kind of like a meat frozen thing, except it was outside. And there was like fake snow on the ground in this one area, and there were these ducks and geese that were alive, and I couldn't figure out why I couldn't see them at first, because I could only just sort of barely make them out because I was not really that close. And then as I got closer, I realized that all the geese, their big bodies, were jammed into these little buckets, meaning their heads and their chest were sticking out, but their tail and their feet and their bottom were just squeezed and, what should I say, twisted and just shoved into these little buckets so that they couldn't get out. All they could do was just sit there and look at people, which I guess the point was they have their heads up to have them looking at people. But man, what a way to do it. And I think a few of the ducks were like that too, but there were a few of them that were free and were running around, and they were mallards. And I caught a mallard that was pretty tame, and I held it for a while and then I let it go back to the market thing. And that was one little scene. And in my dream I didn't feel too bad about it. I wanted to pull them all out and set them free, but I had a feeling like it was against the law to set them free because they were like livestock, I guess. And the next little scene was that Mom and I were in the garage and, you know, we were kind of whispering and stuff. And Dad heard us whispering about how Mom thought he was going to get rid of her, and he came in and said something like, "Oh, is that what you talk about. Why do you give her that impression?" or something like that, and, you know, all like that. And then I think Sandra was in town and we were riding bikes or something, and her and Dad were riding on the tandem and Mom and I were walking and we were just lagging way behind. And then I woke up.
