Dreamed that boyfriend's (20) mother (46) was married to Clark Gable. She was one of his ex-wives. This was a great surprise to me. Dreamed that I was in a bedroom. Clark Gable and present wife (not Bs mother) were sitting on a chair. She was dressed in a bright red suit and was on his leg. She was about to die. She looked over at me and stared. She had large brown eyes and they were so frightening that I woke up. (She was about 26 with blond hair.) Then I remember walking out of room with boyfriend. We were in a hotel corridor. Said to him, "R put on the lights so no one falls down the stairs."
