In my dream I was the advisor of something, viewing something, not participating, and talking to someone else. There were kind of scenes of meadows and farms and so forth. There were horses running wild and then there were cows running with the horses. The person next to me said, "Look at the horses. They're running as fast as the cows." So I said, "Well, mark down that they're running one cow an hour." So they were checking how fast the horses and cows were running by each other. Then there was a short part about the fact that there was some gala event coming up, a big wedding at the ranch or something of that nature. It was for a movie or TV show. I saw people getting makeup put on because there was some big extravaganza scene they were going to play that only lasted 40 seconds, so lots of actors were hired. So they were going to act the scene and then all the makeup would be taken off again. They're only seen once. That's all I remember.
