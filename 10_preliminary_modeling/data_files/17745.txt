I was at a cabin eating healthy Quaker cinnamon flakes.  My brother Stuart came.  Then I was at the high school in PE, looking at large pictures of "the soldier" and "feline" created on the ground.  I was apathetic.  I talked to my computer programming teacher Mrs. Lang.  She said to change things, and we took down chain segments hanging from the ceiling.  I had graduated but I was still in Mr. Johnson's math class, with math homework every other day.  I had new braces, for 22 teeth on the top and 7 on the bottom, which made me wonder, since I only have 24 teeth total.  The braces were a big, colored, plastic crescent.  Then we were at Universal Studios.  I heard earthquake waling by rides and park equipment, including swings.  It was dangerous.  I was in line- I think to go to the library.  I was standing near my dorm roommate Sally- her 'brother Michael' had died.  My brother Stuart pulled me up like Michael Jackson, dancing.  Then we returned to the line, and Martin Mull, the principal, asked for a ride home after going bowling.
