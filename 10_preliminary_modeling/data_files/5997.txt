I am walking along a dirt trail and I notice that someone is following behind. I quicken my pace but the person behind keeps up with me. Soon the trail gets wet with puddles and then it gets very muddy. I continue ahead but the mud becomes waist deep and so thick that I can barely move my legs. I am still being followed and I want to keep moving, so I grab some rocks and vines along the trail side with my hands and I pull myself forward. I repeat this a few times, moving very slowly since the trail now goes uphill. Finally I pull myself out of the mud and I see ahead a large lake at the base of a mountain, shining brilliantly in the sunlight. I feel that I have reached some sort of destination, but am disappointed in it. "This isn't the way it was described in X.'s paper", I say to myself, referring to a paper written by a male colleague at work.
