There were these babies that would blow out fires or put out fires. The mothers of the babies were both in movies. I remember one part when one mother took her baby over to the other person's house at five in the morning. That is all that I remember. Setting: In a movie studio and at a house. Characters: There were two babies (I don't know them) and two mothers (I don't know them either). I wasn't in my dream. Feelings and Thoughts: I don't remember.
