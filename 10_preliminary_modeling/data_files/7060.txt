He (someone I knew well, might be a brother but I don't know) was working at something near the tub. Said his knife wouldn't cut properly. It should be sharp on both sides. I suggest his using a brick to sharpen it. He said this bar would do but it kept graining off. He said he hoped the dust wouldn't bother bathers. I said I would use the tub after breakfast. ... I wanted to straighten up my desk. First I will arrange the pieces of lava I had gotten out for my brothers. A man, woman and child (strangers) were on the other side of the flat-topped desk and were in my way. I asked them to leave so I could use my desk. They asked when was I going to show them the rooms. I said this was a home for old ladies and would never take children. I keep wondering why the breakfast bell doesn't ring. I go out on the verandah two or three times to ask if the bell had rung and I hadn't heard it. It is almost 8 a.m. I ask Mrs. B. Then everyone is hurrying to the dining room and I wonder if I can get there in time to start my toast. There is talk of a buffet for dinner.
