I am at a meeting being conducted by an East Indian man.  When the meeting is over, I say that it seems appropriate to sing Kumbaya.  He isn't familiar with the song, so I tell him it is an African folk song, and I begin to sing it.  There is an African woman at the table, and she begins to sing it softly with me.
