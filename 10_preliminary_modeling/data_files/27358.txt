We were still fighting the Germans and I was still living in W. It was winter and everything was covered with snow. German planes began to fly over the town and I ran down to the basement to hide. Then I could tell by the sound that the German planes had gone and American planes had taken their place. I ran outdoors just in time to see one of our planes begin to fall. It crashed in our front yard and began to burn. Then I saw that the pilot was one of my friends (M-27). I tried to help him out, but before I could get there the crane disintegrated and I was standing in the snow alone.
