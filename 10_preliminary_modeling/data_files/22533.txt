In the second dream I was at the market, in a place where they sold materials and ready-made clothes. The salesgirl insisted that I should take a brocade with stones to make myself a party dress. I answered that I couldn't buy it at the moment. But the lady kept insisting and I wanted to go on my way. She stopped me, saying that she didn't mind losing the money and she gave it to me, and she showed me the material in different colors for me to choose.
