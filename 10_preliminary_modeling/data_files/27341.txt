I dreamed I was upstairs in H--- Hall making a phone call to a girlfriend. (She is 20) At times I seemed to be in a bedroom &amp; at other times the hall was being used as a dining hall. There was a large, long table at which many M--- girls were sitting. I kept talking on the phone &amp; the girls at the table kept calling for me to come eat. Then the scene was again changed to a bedroom &amp; I was still on the phone. All at once some girl came bounding through my room on her hands &amp; feet, like an ape. I thought she was just kidding &amp; then another girl stuck her head in the door &amp; and said "Did you see her?" I told her I had &amp; asked if she were just being silly. She said, "No, she's always like that!"
