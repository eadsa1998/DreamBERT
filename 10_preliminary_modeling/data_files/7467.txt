There are two women in this dream. I make love to each of them within a short span of time -- within the same day or maybe within a few hours. I don't know who the woman is that I first make love to. It may be Bonnie. I see myself making love to the second woman. I can't see her face clearly at the outset, but do see her later. I believe it is Mary. I am sure it is Mary. I do not see her face during lovemaking, but do so afterwards. We are making love in a standing position. When I attain an erection, I want to have intercourse in the "doggy" position, with her back to me. Instead of having the woman on her knees, I have her bend forward from the waist. But I lose my erection and cannot penetrate her. We are walking up Idlewoods Avenue. It is now that I see the woman's face. It is Mary.. When I had made lover to her, I told her that this was the second time I'd made love today -- that I had made love to another woman earlier. We walk past a house on Idlewoods where we had had a flat in the early years of our marriage. As we look at the house, the veranda has the appearance of a kitchen sink draining board. It is loaded with plates, one stacked upon the other. They had recently been washed and are glistening with water.
