A dream that I come with two other friends to offer gifts to my teacher in a tatami mat room. He is sitting in lotus, smiling, glowing as usual. Sam gives a shirt or some cloth, Nancy gives a beautiful bag, I help her open it to show him that it is full of marijuana, good clean stuff. I am excited about this gift, it is a good herb I feel I am offering him. I give a small ceramic pot I have made, and inside is a flower with dying, wilting petals. I am dismayed and we look at it together, and I look at the roshi as if I will cry -- will he still respect me?
