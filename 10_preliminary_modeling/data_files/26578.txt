 I wake p in an apartment room with an erection. I start to masturbate. I ejaculate quickly, but have no sensation of orgasm, so I keep masturbating. The semen forms a gooey white ball that I masturbate with. My green wool hat is pulled over my eyes a bit, partially obscuring my view. The room appears to be double, as if one wall is a mirror and there is a large reflection. I notice the door is open about ten inches. I get up and close the door. The hallway outside is dark. I continue to masturbate with the ball of semen. I hear a voice from the next room, which I recognize as my sister Heather. She says, "Kenneth, what are you doing?", in such a way that she implies that she suspects or knows that I'm masturbating. This surprises and embarrasses me. I notice the window and shades are open. I get up and close them. Still embarrassed and surprised, I pretend I'm sleep talking, mumbling words out loud. I'm scared of seeing things (in double) that aren't real in the room. I'm frightened and caught off guard by the open door and window.
