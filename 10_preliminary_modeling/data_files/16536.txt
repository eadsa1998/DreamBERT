Was a real hodgepodge of different scenes. First of all I dreamt that Mom and I were going to this concert that was put on by this band. It was kind of a blah band, but for some reason we liked them. And it was being held at the Pier because it was a benefit for some kind of senior thing, and it was like an outside thing where you see out in a little caf√© and you listen to them. Well, I was wondering, well, why can't they be at our pier sometime, at the Westport pier, and at the Bayfront Pier other times. And let's see, I don't remember exactly what, but Mom had me take a cab home from downtown Westportrsburg, and when I got, _____ and the lady was real friendly that drove me. But when I got home, she said it was like $50, and I only had like a ten and a couple ones, so I ran inside and I got some more. And I gave it to her and I was just so distraught, I couldn't believe I took a $50 cab ride, which, you know, from downtown back to here would probably only be $10 or $15 on an average. And then we were back to the Bayfront Pier, getting ready to hear this band, and it started to rain and lightning and thunder, so we went inside this library and we sat around a while. And that's about it.
