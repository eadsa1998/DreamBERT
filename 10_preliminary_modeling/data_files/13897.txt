Dad and I went to this place which had men stripping. I was wondering why the hell he brought me here and asked if we could leave. We walked and we chatted to this guy for a bit. Also the wife of the president took photos of him with some guy. We had to get frisked because of something about GTA 4. I saw the guy we were talking to in the car and when we got there he took some popcorn. He was planting evidence to say we had killed this lady. Later I was at Mom's and the middle room door wouldn't close and it was really creepy. It had been this girl's room, who was now dead.
