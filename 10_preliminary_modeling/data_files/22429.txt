This dream is a short one: I dreamt that I was in a patio where there were whole rows of men's shirts. These shirts belonged to my cousin Ulysses (23 years old) and I, together with another person (I cannot say whether it was male or female because this person just appeared by my side without my ever looking at that person at any time), were trying to put them in order. I was thinking that there were too many shirts. It seemed strange to me that they were putting them in order so neatly folded and in rows, as though they were ready to be packed or put away. I think I told my opinion to my companion. While I was ordering the shirts in tall piles (more or less a yard high), I was kneeling and almost submerged among the pile of shirts.
