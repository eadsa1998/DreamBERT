I was at school and there must be some kind of an awards ceremony in the auditorium 6th period, and I was in chorus 5th, and I told Mom to just meet me at a certain spot. And so I came down and I went past her and then I sat down in a seat, and then I remembered I left my notebook in chorus class. But instead of an awards ceremony, it was a movie, and the movie already started. And the seats were like way slanted, and so I had to really climb to get to the top and this alarm thing kept going off because I was blocking the projector thing. It wouldn't go off if I stood up in the aisle, but it went off when I was climbing over the seats that were on a deep incline. And then I sat in the back and it was too soft and I couldn't see a thing. And then this volunteer lady jumped up and helped me get down the stairs and get to the bathroom and get my notebook. And then I woke up.
