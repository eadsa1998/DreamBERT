I was shopping in a large department store. I was looking for something very definite, but I wasn't sure of where it was, or what it was. I had to go to another floor, but I was afraid to get on the escalator because it was going so fast. Finally I steeled myself and forced myself to get aboard the conveyance. I was terrified going up at this break-neck speed. Finally I reached the floor above only to find that what I wanted was in reality downstairs. I was distressed at having to go down again, and confused by the milling crowds. Finally, I managed to get away from the crowd back into a deserted dingy corner where a dingy elevator was. I waited for it to come up with some misgivings, because I recalled similar experiences, from other dream situations, in which the elevator fell or went down too fast and made my stomach feel awful. But I had to get downstairs, and this elevator seemed the only way at the moment. I got in when it came and had the same feeling of inexplainable terror as we descended. It did go too fast, but it didn't fall completely out of control as I had feared, and on the whole wasn't half so bad as I'd anticipated. I felt relieved when I got out.
