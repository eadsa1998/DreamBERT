I found myself before the class with nothing to say. But being more fertile in resources when asleep than ordinarily, I told them I would talk about geology. I laid down an argument which I considered ample to justify my departure proving that physiology presupposed a knowledge of geology. I have forgotten how I made my point. I went on to discuss the formation of Boston Harbor and the headlands of Hull and Nahant. As a natural consequence of my shortsightedness in choosing a subject, I found that twenty minutes sufficed for me to tell all I knew. Unable to think of anything further, I stood in silent distress for a while, and then slipped into a seat whence I looked at my vacant station and thought, "Seeing this is a dream, perhaps somebody will come in and finish the lecture," but no one did.
