I dreamt about the institution at which I work (a clinic) and about the patients, especially about a 23-year-old girl who is also a patient and who in real life gives me a lot of trouble. The clinic looked very old, very cold, more so than it really is. The 12-year-old kid seemed much younger, and I remember that she was going through the clinic on a tricycle. At that moment there was also a nurse who is 45-years-old, more or less, and who also works there. The corridors in the clinic were unending, extremely long, in the dream. I don't' remember any more.
