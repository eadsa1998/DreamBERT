Going to sleep last night I told myself the next time I'd be awake I would actually be asleep.  It worked.  It felt like entering a virtual reality.  I was excited that it worked.  I don't remember what I saw, but my first thought was to try out lucid control with something fun.  I was going to fly.  Up, with ease.  I had only managed several feet up before I awoke.
