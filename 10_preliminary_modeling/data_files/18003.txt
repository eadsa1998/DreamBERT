I was at the park. I had these little cars in my hand, I was riding a bicycle. The I crashed into a car. The cars in my hand got bigger and I got in them. This little girl had some in her hand and wanted to drive in them. I went into a fort and this guy didn't want us to go in it. I was in the house a lot. We were at our house. John was telling a very, very, scary story. And the car came to our house. Then I thought I was in my house in bed and I woke up in my school.  And then, my teacher said we can have drinks. I got a drink. And then a little boy came up to me and he said, What's the matter and I said my mom is missing. And then he said, want to look at JC Penney? We're at JC Penney, .and I woke up.
