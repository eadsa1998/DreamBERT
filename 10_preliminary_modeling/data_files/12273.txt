Mom and Ezra left me in her car while they went to get dinner from KFC. Her brake lights were on, which meant something about a bike. Daryl and someone came past on a bike and I had a bike so I followed them to this place. Elijah, Seamus and Dmitri were also there. I was hanging around for a while, when Ezra came with his burger. I hurried back to the car and Mom had eaten half of my burger.
