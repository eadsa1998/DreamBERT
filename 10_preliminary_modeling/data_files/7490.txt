I am in a building in which I have my residence -- and down the hall there is a hospital wing where Mary has a room. At the start of this dream I am making the bed. As I do so, I see on Mary's side of the bed the mattress is broken and it has a large hole there. Next I'm in Mary's hospital room. We embrace before I look at her face. We are standing, and while in a tight embrace, I cry, and declare my love for her, over and over again. She, too, is declaring her love for me. I then look at her for the first time. She is beautiful, and is costumed like Cleopatra (as depicted in a Hollywood movie). She is wearing a headdress and flowers in her hair. She looks absolutely gorgeous -- as she had before the advance of the disease. Mary is smiling and happy. I ask her if she is trying to say goodbye to me. Mary looks puzzled and asks why would I ask her such a thing. I explain that early in our marriage she had dressed up exactly as she is now, and for a very brief time. Now, by the manner of her dress, I wonder if she is trying to tell me something.
