I was at some hotel and Ezra went swimming with seals in this fake little beach thing they had. It had waves and all. I was all of a sudden in a hallway in the hotel, running from the water. There had been a leak and I was following four horses? I got to a door and closed it and ran upstairs and the water came through.
