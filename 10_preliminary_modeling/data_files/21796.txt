I saw Palident and a boy get into a boxcar. They had a pony with them. The pony jumped up into the boxcar and went to the corner where there was food for him. Then Palident threw out a rope and lassoed a pile of his belongings on the ground about 20 feet away and a small pile that belonged to the boy. He then tied the rope to the inside of the boxcar and went on with his work inside. Someone built a shanty on top of a boxcar and on stilts. The freight train started to move and the rope with Palident's belongings went up into the air. It was like a kite. It was sliding on phone wires along the route. I was driving on the highways in my old Plymouth. I had two boys in the back seat and Judy and someone else in the front. We were going to Ascot Park. I stopped on the way and there were some boy hitchhikers. One of them stuck his head thru the open window and looked in. It was Bob. I said, "Come in, Bob, there is room for you." He got in and we went on. My Plymouth didn't have no pep at all. Somehow I was to borrow or I borrowed $50 and Al from Dill said he owed me $16 and somebody more.
