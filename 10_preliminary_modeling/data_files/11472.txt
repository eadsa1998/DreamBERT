I was fully clad in a black cowboy suit. I was practicing paddling a canoe on some rapids. It seemed that a certain angle which I turned the canoe allowed it to drift upstream against the swift current, with no paddling required. A large snake was constructively criticizing my efforts which seemed rather successful. I watched the snake swim around a bit with its head raised out of the water. It seemed to wait on the shore downstream, behind me then as I made each trial with the canoe. I seemed to be a bit afraid of the snake, although I respected and heeded its advice. It seemed to be friendly, but I was still slightly afraid of it since it was a rather large snake. I woke up after several successful runs up the short rapids.
