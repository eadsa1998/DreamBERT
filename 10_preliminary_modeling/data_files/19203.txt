It consisted simply of a public figure, who I identify as Lyndon Johnson, and his wife, being received in a street in a reception as any reception would be out in the world. The ticker tape parade, etc. where he and his wife were always stepping out a big presidential or diplomatic limousine and being received by police and dignitaries and throngs of people. I saw this scene anywhere from 3 to 4 times, and it never varied. It was always the same.
