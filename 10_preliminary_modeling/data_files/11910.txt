Mom and I were walking and I saw a big bus which was a ferret bus thing. I looked behind this sheet and this guy looked down and asked if I wanted any ferrets. I did. You had to pull this ladder down and climb up, so I did. There were four BIG ferrets and millions of little ferrets. There was a Gizmo looking one. Then we saw some guys come with wooden boards. The guy, whose name was Alex, said they throw boards up to try and kill the ferrets. We got a hold of their boards and they left. I don't know what happened after that but Alex and I fell in love or something gay and then he was killed. I was upset and I think I killed some people but I don't remember.
