My husband and I were planning a vacation trip thru the mountains. We had maps and were figuring out different places that we wanted to go. The maps were hard to follow because they were too general and they didn't have all the details I found that we needed. But we figured out where we were going to stop the first night in some little town. While we were thinking about this and figuring it out, we were there somehow. It was just a little mountain town and we were looking or a restaurant to eat at. Also in this dream we figured out somehow that in our trip thru the mountains that we were going to see the Grand Canyon.
