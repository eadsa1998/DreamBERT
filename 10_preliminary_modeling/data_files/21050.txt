I was washing the windows on the house at 11 E. 68th St. I saw the antenna on our house and the red house. A carpenter was fixing he gutters. We moved in our old house. I looked at the kitchen floor and it was hardwood. The small strips. I noticed there was like tar between the strips. Then I looked into the dining room and the old softwood floors were there sanded down. I stepped back and a sliver came up. She picked it up. We had three beds. They were the old-fashioned steel bed. The kitchen door had a glass all the way down and we had a shade on the door. A fellow came in and ate with us. He said. "Colbusie" and something else in Slovenian, but didn't understand it. Ann was working. I walked thru the woodwork building.
