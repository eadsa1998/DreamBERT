These people, who were pioneers, heard this news that soldiers were coming into their land because it was Indian territory. The soldiers had to get them out of there because Native Americans had been moved out, and then the law said that it should be their land, not the pioneers'. They sent soldiers there, so if you didn't go, they would make you go or make you join in. The pioneers were leaving. I was watching this.
