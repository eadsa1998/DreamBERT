I was in a basement of a strange house with a 18-year-old girl whom I date occasionally. One of my fraternity brothers (some year as I am) and I were locking all the doors. I was going to sleep with the girl that night while my frat brother kept guard. Then the scene switched. Instead of sleeping in the basement we were going to sleep in a cabin on top of a 30 foot pole in the middle of a field. (The field was one in which I played football as a young child.) We climbed up a large ladder, carrying blankets to the cabin. Several other people were on the ground, watching (strangers). The girl fell to the ground from about 20 feet up the ladder and was unhurt. I remarked that, she must very athletic as she didn't get killed.
