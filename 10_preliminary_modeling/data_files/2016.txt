I am a kindergartner or first grade teacher. I can't remember which because I haven't been doing my job lately. The room is a mess. Things are all over the floor, furniture stacked. I'm talking to a woman, I think it's my mother. Archie sits on a chair and I put my head in his lap as we talk. He feels uncomfortable and gets up, still talking. He gets something and returns and sits. I sit up so he can sit in the chair and I lay my head on him again. Sensual, pleasant. I was thinking he didn't like my liking our friendly contact. I turn on lights. We are now in a kitchen. Marjie Lawrence comes by. We are shocked by her appearance. She looks a little like Thea.  She wears a scarf over her head, big 1950's glasses and heavy eye makeup. She looks sick. My mother says, "Look, here's Mabel," and I say, "I didn't recognize you." She says, "Yeah!" Her eyes are giving her trouble, some disease. I see gunk on her eyes. She's trying to cover up the bad look with the scarf and glasses. She's embarrassed. She says, "Lord! I'll probably have to talk with Jerry!" I say, "Shh! He's around the corner." She looks caught. She stands up to leave and suddenly water pours out of her, a bladder accident. She stands there, disgusted, but can't stop it so just lets it flow. A young woman walks by and stares. Mabel just shrugs her shoulders. I get up out of my wheelchair to get paper towels to help clean up. I feel good I can do this. I want to ease her embarrassment. I tell her this has happened to me before. We are cleaning up the floor and a woman says, "Can I be of help?" I say, "Sure. Come on in." She helps sweep up pieces of cut paper that are littered all over the floor.
