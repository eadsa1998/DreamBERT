 I am in a locker room area before a game. I have a band-aid on my toe which has slid down to the narrow part of the toe. I have a toe infection. I pop the infection and puss comes out of it. I have long toenails. I scrape the skin of the infected area off in a big chunk. I go to get another band-aid. There is a young kid watching me.
