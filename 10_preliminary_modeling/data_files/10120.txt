We have a Christmas Eve celebration: invite all the lonely people we know; one black man insists on sleeping in the dog house. He told me that he was no longer a counselor at the Counseling Center but a dentist, and he cleans my teeth as "payment." After much talk about counseling, I remember to light the candles.
