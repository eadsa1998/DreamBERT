["Swimming With a bird"]  I am preparing for a performance. It is almost time for it to start. I start looking for the dress I will wear. I search through the rack of clothes and can't find the one I'm supposed to wear. A woman comes over and finds the blue velvet dress. I am looking for a tape of music I might want to use, but realize that it would be a waste of time to get it now. The program is already fixed. Now I am in the dress and Bill Domhoff and Bob Van de Castle are there to examine my mind. I will go into a trance of some kind and they will analyze what is in there. They are very interested in this research. After they examined me, I suddenly jump into a swimming pool. In the pool is a small swimming white speckled bird, sort of like a penguin in shape. It is swimming around the edges of the pool. I twirl around, dress and all, and swim with him. Bill watches as I'm still in my trance state. The bird goes underwater and I follow. It is fun and the bird and I watch each other in a friendly way. We playfully swim together.
