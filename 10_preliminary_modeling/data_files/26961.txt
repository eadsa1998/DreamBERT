I was in charge of a floor in our hospital in M. One of the nurses that was working on the floor was very untidy about the appearance of her hair. I remember that it was my duty to tell her that she must do something to her hair so that it would be tidier and neater. The other nurse is about my age - maybe younger. I told her about her hair and then the dream was gone.
