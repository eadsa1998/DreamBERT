I was in the CAS office with Bill C and Jane C. At least Bill C and I were sitting at a large round table that was covered with paper. We were working on various things, discussing things that needed to be done etc. I believe we came across an invoice that was overdue. He got angry with me because he had just come back from the accountant's office and thought he should have had that with him. He told me I am responsible for making sure he has things like that on a timely basis and when he needs them. I was thinking that Jane C does the internal accounting and he pays a professional accounting firm to work with her, and I rarely even see the invoices. I wasn't sure how I could be responsible for this. He right away got angry and said something about me not thinking he should hold me responsible for this. I was getting very upset and frustrated because I didn't know what to do or say. After he left, Jane C said something to me to try to reassure me and make me feel better. It helped a little hearing her say whatever it was.
