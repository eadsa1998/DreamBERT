We were shopping as a family for some sort of character my father might use at work.  Many were Halloween costumes, Ty babies and such.  It was night in the parking lot and my brother Stuart ambled up behind.  I swung around and hit him in the groin.  I had to explain my action, that I didn't know it was him and I was being cautious.  There was chocolate and mint ice cream in a room with a fan.  Some time during all this I managed to take my socks off.  I saw my boyfriend Jeremy and someone else for a moment; I apologized to Jeremy for getting him sick.  Stuart and I were outside watching a castle(?).  It was a dark castle, and flames were shooting out from a barred window.  Then later, again.  It was Satan.  I got scared and jumped below to hide.  Stuart yelled not to, but it was too late.  Satan came out.  I saw his face and heard his voice, but I don't remember.  His fingers were twice the size of mine, blotchy and red.  His fingernails were black and extended about half an inch past his fingertips, like curved hair it was so thin- but enough to scratch.  He touched my cheek.  I was to take an orange pill he gave me, which would blind me.  My brother Stuart had to guide me and we both had to horizontally scale the length stone wall to which we were left clinging, twice.  We were doomed if we failed and fell.
