I went back in time? Cory Monteith had been in something that had gotten popular, but not at the moment. I was walking down the street and I called out to him and told him about stuff in the future to help him and also to try and get close to him. At some point a group of guys I went to knew about him and they started to fight, so I got out. Other people tried to take Cory. Later, I went to a concert and it was of someone I didn't like. This guy and a kid pushed in front and they didn't have tickets on them. My ticket counted for three people. They were getting in trouble and I said 'hang on' and I called Mom and asked if "Ezra and Ari bought tickets" and she said Ezra did and I said it was either Ari or Dad that was going. There was also some Kylie Minogue play there too.
