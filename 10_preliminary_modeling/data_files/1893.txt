I see Mabel and we walk. Then my "husband" comes over and looks at me. I say, "Did you want to go home now?" He just looks at me noncommittally. I say, "I'll be there in a minute." He leaves. I say goodbye to Mabel, but feel uneasy because she might want to stay and talk. I feel pulled in two directions. So I go down the hall and round the corner and see my "husband" seated with his buddies in a tavern. I am looking in through a window. So I signal to him. "Did you want to stay with your friends longer?" He just looks at me. I signal that I'll go back and talk with Mabel for a while. When I find Mabel, she doesn't want to talk.
