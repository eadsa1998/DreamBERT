My sister (16) and I seemed to be down by the lake and going to go in swimming. The water was beautiful and quite shallow in some spots, shallow enough that you could see green grass growing up from the bottom and out through the water. I felt that I needed exercise badly and I really wanted to go swimming on account of this. It seems that Miss Andreas of the gym department and some other gym faculty were there, but I don't remember them too clearly. Well, I was quite fearful of the snakes and other water creatures that might be hovering around in the shallow water, but I went in anyway and was very glad I did because the water felt nice. I woke up then.
