I am on a trip and have to buy groceries when I return at night: I have two huge sacks of groceries. I cannot carry them home. So I hide them in the bushes, and go to call Frank from a small grocery store when Evelyn Helgeson (former NS school supervisor) works. I put in my dime to call, but make a mistake in dialing. I say "Oh" and she gives me a second dime. The dime falls to the floor and I pick it up and dial our number: NO ANSWER. So I get my groceries and go on home by bus. When I get home, Frank has gone to shop as well; will be back soon; I also bought a lamp; blue and red wool and a big box.
