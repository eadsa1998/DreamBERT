I am in a sort of classroom, only it's sort of like my house. I am explaining to the instructor (male) that he doesn't understand, what I'm dealing with is more complex than just the English language (like parts of speeches). I am working with Natural Language Programming. As I tell him this, I am moving a broken office chair (the back rest is lopsided and partially unattached) to another room and out of the way, only where I'm putting it is sort of where my computer would be in my house.
