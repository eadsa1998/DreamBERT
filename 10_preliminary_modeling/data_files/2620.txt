I am watching a production of one of my plays. I see the audience (a classroom) is restless and I realize they do not like my play. It is long and confusing and boring. There is no action. At the end, I say, "I want feedback. It is important so I can improve. I know you don't like it, but tell me why." I feel pain and embarrassment and some pride, but I have the courage to face this. They tell me the first part is boring because it just goes through a history of self. The second part is more interesting because there is relationship and activity (action). I agree. Now I look for a bathroom and find a public one. I look over the stall doors to find one that's empty. I find one where the toilet is sideways. I go in and use it. As I go out, I remember I left my Bic cigarette lighter (green). I think of Andrea and how she's getting critiqued. I go back in and look for the lighter and find it.
