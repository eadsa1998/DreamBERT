 I'm riding a bicycle down the hill of Bauer Avenue on the east side of Jefferson School in Oak Valley. My neighbors Luke and Wanda Stalk walk near the brown corner house at the corner of Bauer Avenue and 3rd Street. Luke wants a steak and a six-pack of ___ Red. He gives Wanda $5 to get this. I ride down the sidewalk and cut the corner on the lawn of Jackson's brown house as I turn.
