We are traveling in the East, near Jerusalem. I am driving; we are with Frank and another person. We stop as a hotel in a small Arabian town and I swim and play around. We leave in a hurry: as we round a corner I remember that I forgot my suitcase, my sweater and my tote bag with all my Xerox material in it. I say "We have to go back to find my things," but I can't remember the name of the town or the hotel where we stayed. Frank reluctantly agrees, and we retrace our trip for quite a distance, and we somehow find the hotel. Two detectives from a movie scene are there, but they do not want to be recognized, so they don't answer. I find the woman who owns the place and swim over to her and show her a green sucker with a broken stick and I tell her that was the sucker I used to get when I was a young child!! I tell her of my plight and ask her to help me find my bag and esp. the Xerox material in the tote bag. She does not hold out much hope, but will help. Frank remembers to return a book he borrowed on the Armenians. -- I wake up before I know the outcome....
