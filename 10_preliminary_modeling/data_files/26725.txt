 I'm in a pub in Oak Valley where the McDonalds used to be on the southwest corner of Home Avenue and Main Street. I have a bicycle in the pub. I walk the bicycle down steep stairs. Really wild shots are served at the club for getting people really drunk. I'm going to a cabin, which may be my friend Kevin Simpson's father's cabin, which holds four people. I choose my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas and her friend Elise Rooks to go with us. I tell them about it plainly.
