A security guard is standing in front of a building. This tall muscular man walks up to him with a gun and asks where a certain office is. The guard won't tell him. He gets shot but not before he sounds an alarm that rings up to the office. I'm the doctor in the office and I round up all the women and children in the waiting room. It's a battered women's clinic. I make them all go through my office into another office and as we go, I'm deadbolting all these doors behind us. Once I've helped them all hide, I go back into my office and sit behind my desk. The man breaks into the office; he has a gun and he wants to know where a woman is. I'm holding a gun under my desk aimed at him and I have on a bulletproof vest -- I'm not afraid at all. He leaves the office. I'm surprised and relieved because I know the police are here now. But on his way out, the man has started fires in the building so now I have to get the women and children down the fire escape.
