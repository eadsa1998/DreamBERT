There were zombies (Dawn of the Dead orig.). I knew the blokes from Monty Python and Graham Chapman had been bitten and was in bed, sick. He was turning into a zombie and for some reason some things would make the people turning into a zombie, go crazy. A chicken wandered into the room and from its view, it was all bulgy and reddish. Graham went psycho, turning into a zombie and then eventually calming down. He ended up dying. I also remember that when people bit someone's finger, they would turn into a zombie. We were at someone's house, and it was scary. I wagged school and was hiding behind a tree and Dad saw me.
