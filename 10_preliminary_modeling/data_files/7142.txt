So I could go along on the tour. I ask what means of travel. Three days by steamer, three by train and three by . . . I ask how far by sea. To Trondheim. I think it will be fun to see the finished cathedral and other changes since 1939. Looking off the deck I see a steamer approaching us and aft is Diamond Head, now bluish in color but it seems to be pointing the wrong way.
