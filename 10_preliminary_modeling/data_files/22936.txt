I was in the woods with a group of people, and it began to storm.  We were all gathered beneath a tree, and nearby there was a loud crack (not as loud as a lightning strike, however) and a flash of sparks.  I was scared to remain under the tree any longer, and moved away, but the others remained.  I was exposed to the rain then (though I don't remember getting wet), but I continued through the forest until I came upon another group of people, these sitting on the ground having a picnic.  Kathy Reynault and Bonita were in one of the small subgroups.  They seemed neither hostile nor overly friendly to each other.
