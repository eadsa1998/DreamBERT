Was playing a new board game.  Someone called about a job offer.  I didn't really want to leave the game we'd just started, but I did, and listened to the spiel about leadership, and then the person wanting an answer.  I was hesitant to say no.  I asked them about the job- I had a hunch- was it poli-sci?  It was so I wasn't interested.  I went back to the game.  A man was giving a lecture and I was sitting near the front.  My parents were in back.  The man elicited strange feelings from me.  I was somewhat put off by him, yet I liked him and clung to his legs, somehow helping (demonstration?) his lecture.  After, I met with my parents.  They were holding a video the man had lent to them.  They told him how much they enjoyed his talk and returned the video to him.  Upon leaving we went to a sort of underground store and were looking for a copy of the video.  The cover was orange and yellow like a sunset, and had a picture of an old-fashioned donut on it.
