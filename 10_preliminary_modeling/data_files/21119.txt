I had a dream. Someone came to me as I was in bed and said, "You had 14 winners for a change." I played some hookups. A fellow wanted a nickel. I said no and he was going to ruin my car. I yelled John, Joe to Steve and he ran away. I had a stolen tire on my spare. The lock didn't work so good. I was playing and always win back my money.
