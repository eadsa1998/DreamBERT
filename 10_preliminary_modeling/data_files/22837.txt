I am walking along a sort of neutral ground (median strip) parking lot from Mr. Ronheiger's car.  I am with someone I know, but don't remember who.  This person tells another person who is parked along the side of the lot that there is a cigarette on the seat of Mr. Ronheiger's car with dope in it.  I am shocked at this.  I notice that the driver of each car looks terrible, like a drug addict.  I pass a policeman when I cross the street, but am afraid to say anything while within sight of the cars.  When I get to the apartment building where I live, there are police all around.  (There is a police station on the ground floor.)  I walk inside, contemplating whether to tell them, and someone tells me that Rocky Gorman wants to see me outside.  I out a side door and Rocky grabs me by the collar and warns me not to tell the police.  I tell him I only live there, but we start to fight.  I take a couple of blows but get the upper hand, and with two uppercuts to the face knock him out.  I then carry him up to my apartment.  By then he is coming to, and I try to talk him out of the drug habit, recalling that he has wanted to be a great orchestra leader and probably turned to dope because of his failure.  I put him down and give him instructions on how to get out.  When he gets down to the next floor, however, he seems to be Rover (our dog).  I can see him over the landing, and tell him to enter the open door of the elevator, which will automatically close and go to the next floor, where I will have him repeat the process.
