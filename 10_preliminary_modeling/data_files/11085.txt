It was Easter Sunday and I went to my home church where I had not been for quite a while with a girl I recognized as being from college. She reintroduced me to all the younger people who were very friendly. At one time there were three of us girls and three fellows walking somewhere. One boy was the one I had dated a while ago and one girl was from college. We were all carrying little suitcases--I had left home to come to church because of some argument at home. When we went in church, I sat with my mother and sister as part of the service, a woman came driving down the aisle in a jeep, drove up the steps to the altar, turned over as she turned around, but righted herself and drove back down. Mother was also in service somehow, but I can't quite remember how.
