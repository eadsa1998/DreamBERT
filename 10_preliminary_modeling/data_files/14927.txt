These girls were bullying this girl. I helped the girl and I think I tore something of theirs. I yelled at them. Then it was a show. This guy said his first thought was to burn the place. I had to get somewhere and I called Stephen Rea for help but he was drunk. Mom wouldn't take me. Darren was there too.
