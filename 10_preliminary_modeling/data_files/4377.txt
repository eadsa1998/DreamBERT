["House on fire save the writing."] I live in a 2 story house on the corner. My neighbor house on the left is like Lucy's rental house. It is on fire. Raging, engulfed in flames. I run out of my house and go over yelling fire. I see Reva in there and call to her. She runs out. I ask her if her child and husband are all right. She says yes. I look up at the roof of my house and see sparks and glowing red. Fire, I run and get the hose and try to wet down the roof. I am worried about my writings and manuscripts and my photos. I yell to a neighbor to call the fire department. The flames get worse. I see my bedroom upstairs going up in flames. My writings I run back around the front. Finally a fire truck comes. They are slow. The first one is working on the other house. A second one comes. They go upstairs and start on the fire. I will it to not be the bedroom with my manuscripts but the center bathroom. I run in and say to the fireman is it all right if I get some photos and book from the downstairs room? He says OK I yell at someone, a woman friend to help me. I step in as the front wall isn't there now and pick up photos of me and my kids and they are discolored from the smoke and fire damage. Piles of them laying out on the furniture. I say one copy of a book manuscript and a few other writings. The house is totally destroyed. I say to someone as I am back outside I only have the clothes on my back but at least I saved my most important writings. I am happy with that.
