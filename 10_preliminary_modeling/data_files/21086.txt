I was swimming on shallow water on a board, then I made off I was swimming up a hill on asphalt road and I went up. An old lady and a girl fell into the lake. I took of my hat and waded in sand, saved the girl and the old lady. I was going to school again. I found a $150 two 50 cent pieces and a 25 cent piece. A boy owned a restaurant and this lay on the floor by the counter. I picked it up and threw a quarter on the counter for the boy. He gave Bob and me some grapes that were flat and red.
