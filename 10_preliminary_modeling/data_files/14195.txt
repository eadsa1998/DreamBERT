There were werewolves. To prevent them going to you, you supposedly had to greet them and say their name. We were at some stands. Claire (Lost) was pregnant and was kicking one leg back and forth. This attracted them. We got to her and this girl said she'd have to have the baby. We took her to the car. She wanted to have it at the airport. Mom was getting stuff out of the boot. A werewolf came and we told her to run. Later, it showed the door of the car covered in blood.
