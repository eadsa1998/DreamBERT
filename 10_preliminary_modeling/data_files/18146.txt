I don't exactly where we were, but my brother and my sister were there and my husband. I don't believe my parents were. I and my brother and my sister must have all been about 4 or 5 years younger than we actually are because we were all acting rather childish. What we were going to do was to leave home because we thought we weren't being treated right. We had to sneak away a little bit because if these people caught us. It wasn't just our parents, it was somebody else--these big guardians. They would try to keep us from going. At any rate we were going to leave and my husband was trying to keep me from going. At any rate we were going to leave and my husband was trying to keep me from going. I said I was going because I didn't think that he really loved me. He said, "Yes, I do. I love you for your" something or other and I can't remember what, but I wish I could. I said that just shows it. You don't love me for me. So we left and we all walked down this little path until we came to this place where they were constructing a road. They were doing it in sort of a strange way. They had this road built almost over to meet this path and apparently it was going to turn and go up this path at practically a right angle. From the end of the cement over to about the path they had lain this thin flat piece of metal and some Negro men were standing at the far end of it on the path, way down on the road quite a distance another man was standing with a piece of similar metal. We knew that before we could get past these people that we would have to have little broken off pieces of the metal at the right length. We weren't quite sure how we were going to go about getting it.
