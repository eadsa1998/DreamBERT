Uppermost bookcase section tilts forward. It holds a single volume of Encyclopedia Brittanica. Angle of tilt is slight and I have no fear that the section will fall. In one of the other sections is a large volume bound in very expensive-looking, thick, brown leather. The leather shines as though varnished. There are also a couple of substantial pamphlet holders, labeled "government publications."
