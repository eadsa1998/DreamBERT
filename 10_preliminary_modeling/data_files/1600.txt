I must become more aware of the kinesthetic. I notice my left leg. I am picking up my car. It's been repaired. Now I go to pick up some foreign student who will come live with me and want to drive my car. When I pick him up, there is some confusion. I want to turn on the radio and get some news. A plastic cover (like over Marilyn's cake) is over the control knobs. I twiddle with the knobs and get an occasional weak light on. I focus on channel 12. It is a TV news station. The foreign student doesn't want to live with me, but does want to borrow the car. I feel uncomfortable with this and refuse. He is miffed.
