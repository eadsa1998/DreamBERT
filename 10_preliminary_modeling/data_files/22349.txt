I and a group of people, among which was my brother, were in a medieval tower and a sacrifice was needed so that the rest could breathe because there wasn't enough air. I made the sacrifice and cut my chest open with a knife, but started to feel panicky when I saw all my internal organs. I begged my brother to cut my aorta, but he didn't want to do it. Finally I was able to do it and experienced great relief -- after my last breath I had died, but I was still aware of what happened around me. Near a "Chinese wall." I heard people whispering that it was a Chinese wall; I didn't understand. I dreamt about Norma again. Together we looked at the ocean from my house. I saw incoherent images, dogs, cars, friends, horizons. Everything produced sadness and melancholy in me.
