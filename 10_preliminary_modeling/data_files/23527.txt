I had two counseling appointments at school -- one at the health center and one at psychological services. Then I realized they overlapped, so I had to reschedule the second one. I also was worried that I wasn't supposed to get two appointments in one day. I was at the health center going to my appointment and then calling the psychological services receptionist to change my appointment time. Then I was walking across a campus (not my school) and there was a pig in a truck. The man stopped the truck to put the pig in someone else's vehicle. They thought the pig would be belligerent but it went into the other vehicle by itself. I was walking and trying to find the truck but the roads were confusing. Trying to get into the hills above campus?
