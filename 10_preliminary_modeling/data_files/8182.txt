I went in to the CAS office. I was wearing my plaid flannel pants and a T-shirt. I went to the restroom. I felt really bad about how I looked. I wanted to hurry up and get out of there before anyone saw me. But when I went from the restroom I wanted to hurry back to my office and hoped that no one saw me. But when I got ready to walk back to the office I had to walk past two other offices and through one office. Of course, the receptionists in all three of those offices were all three women who were dressed very professionally. I think I went down there twice. The second time I realized I didn't have to go through the one office to get back to my office. There was a very narrow hallway behind the office walls. The wall was glass but at least I didn't have to walk through that office. When I went back the second time, when I got to the one office, the office was locked and all the lights were turned out. Earlier I had seen the receptionist fixing her hair and stuff. She had put some rollers in the front of her hair and taken them out. She was wearing a red business suit. When I came back the second time that office was locked, dark. Then I got to our office and the lights were all turned out. I worried for a second that Bill C had left and locked the door. Fortunately, he hadn't locked it. He had just turned the lights out. So I went in, turned the lights back on and went into my office.
