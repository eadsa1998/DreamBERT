A dark haired young woman named blossem is a prisoner. A woman guard asks me do I need to guard her as she works in the fields? I apparently own a ranch and she is the prison labor. The guard doesn't want to guard her. It takes all of her time. I think about it, going along with the guard's idea. But then I see a paper where in it, it says Be sure and guard blossem. I hesitate and then say, "Yes, you need to guard her. She escapes every chance she gets. In my mind's eye, I see her already escaping from the fields.
