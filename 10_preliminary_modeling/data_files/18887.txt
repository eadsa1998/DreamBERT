This dream took place in my front yard. It seemed to be much larger than it actually is and there was a carnival being held right in our front yard. I remember knowing that it was going to go on for 2 days and after the first day, I recall looking around the carnival grounds for money that people had lost. I collected a full handful of nickels, dimes and quarters. I remember seeing a large black bull charging into a sawdust pit. It was part of the carnival. I also recall someone walking by our house and spotting some money on the ground. I remember the person, a young kid, male, 12 or 13, looking at me and then running over and picking up the money.
