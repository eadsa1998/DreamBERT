I was with a group of people (I don't know who) in the house of an ex-classmate of mine. Everything was dark. We were sitting on the floor against the wall. Suddenly I found myself walking with people from the university by the school gate. We went into a place where there was an assembly, which looked like a movie theater. I was spending my time looking for my coat, without finding it. The people started to go and then the place was transformed into the house in which I lived up to five years ago, and we were sitting there, around a table. One of the girls said that it was already late ("five o'clock") and something about a mass. Everything was still dark. One of the boys was my boyfriend (he is really the boyfriend of a friend of mine). I was going with them up to the door, and when we were saying goodbye, I was very surprised that he did not kiss me. When I passed by the living room, I saw it all lit up and there were 6 or 8 people talking.
