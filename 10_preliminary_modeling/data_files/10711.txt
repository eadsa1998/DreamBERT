I was in biology lab and had a bag of cookies and a bag of after dinner mints. I put them on the desk and said everyone was welcome to help themselves. When I went to get some, they were all gone, so I went around to each person in the lab and made them put some back. I was perplexed because they had taken advantage of my generosity and disgusted because some of them had made such pigs of themselves.
