I was swimming in a river.  For some reason I remember my father was with me.  We started swimming or drifting a ways, but came to an area where the river was full of corpses floating around.  I was disturbed and tried to stay away from the dead bodies, but the waves splashing made would only bring them closer, so it was a struggle to get away from the 'contaminated area'.  I was afraid to be near the bodies.
