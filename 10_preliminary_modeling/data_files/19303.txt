I was flying an airplane around the playground because for some reason there was a war there. After that I somehow started to shoot basketballs off the playground equipment into shoes. The basketballs turned into little black balls in mid-flight so they would fit into the shoes. This was some kind of contest that I won since I was the only person who made it. Then I was in Disney world, but I was being held hostage by weird colored spiders and birds who could talk. I killed them by throwing water on them which made them turn to fuzz balls.
