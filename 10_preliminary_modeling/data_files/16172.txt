A security guard in the court building was showing me all kinds of devices that he had for when he was leading people into jail. And one of them was this white cup, this silver blue box with this black display in it, supposedly had a mind of its own, and it would just speak to people for no reason at all and just say things about them and stuff. And I dreamt that one of our neighbors suddenly died in her family -- I think it was her father or husband or somebody -- and we were going to have a condolences reception, like I had organized a little party for everybody. And it was like Mom totally took control of the whole thing, and I don't remember exactly how it went. But I was going to bring the sound system out in the front yard and hook it up and be the DJ, and Mom was controlling the whole thing and I just said out of, not really meaning it, but to show her what I felt. I said, "I don't have to bring my sound system out here. You guys want to control the whole thing, you go right ahead." And that's how it was. Then I woke up.
