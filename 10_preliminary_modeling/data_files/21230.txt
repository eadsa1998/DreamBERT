I was driving my car down a hill. There was snow on the ground. It stalled by Elyria garage and I let it park in front of the door, blocking it. I had to go to work, so I left it there. After work I came there and didn't see the car. I went into the garage and it was there. I told Joe to fix it. When he opened the trunk door, the trunk was full of ashes. He told me to take out the ashes, so I got a shovel and went to work. He showed me the rusted body with holes in it.
