I am outdoors in a town square. Someone tells me that there is something for me at the nearby window of a large public building -- is it the Post Office? I go there and am handed a calico cat which is the color and size of my pet A. "That's my cat", I say, and I am a little surprised. I start the voyage home with her. Somehow this involves a stop at my office at work. X. (a male co-worker) comes in and sees the cat in a carry case on the office floor. "Close the door", I say. He does this and then asks, "Does she roll around the floor [in the cage]?" "This isn't a hampster in a wheel", I answer, expecting him to know better. Then I arrive at my home with the cat, only to find that A. is already there waiting for me. "Oh, this is another cat", I realize. I put the two cats together on the living room floor to play. They look very similar, and I think to myself, "I guess I now have two cats." The new cat, however, frightens A., and A. stays away. I pick up the new one and hold her in my arms. Suddenly I notice for the first time that despite her beautiful fur, her mouth is ugly and has big teeth, reminding me somehow of a racoon. "I'll call you 'Coon'", I decide. Now Coon walks around the living room while A. sleeps. A. begins to shake and twitch in her sleep, and I realize that she is having a disturbed dream -- a nightmare? -- about being bullied by the new cat. She wakes up with a start, looks around for Coon, and moves away from her.
