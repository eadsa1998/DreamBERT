I was at Norman and Sheila's apartment in New York.  They had another guest, and to my infinite amazement, his first name was Gilbert, and his middle name was the same as my last name.  I didn't get his last name, but the name Russell kept intruding into my mind for some reason.  On top of that, they called him Charlie.  I asked him where his middle name came from, and he started telling about his father being from the north, but I don't remember anymore than that.   We all went outside, along with Wayne and Joyce, to play some game or have some other kind of activity.  Either as part of the activity or because I didn't think much of it, I was lying on the top bunk of bunk beds, in the middle of the street.  It was night, and I have the impression the street was like the one in Paris which runs along the Seine near the hotel where we stayed.   There was a fierce battle going on, though whether real or staged, I'm not sure.  There were massive waves of attacking infantry all around right there on the street, bullets flying everywhere, dozens of men being cut down, screaming with blood-curdling realism.  When it all died down, I decided I had had enough of this "game," so I started to get up and go inside.  I was naked, though, or had on pajamas or underwear at the most, so I hesitated a while longer.  When I did get out from under the cover and get up, there was a woman on the street who wore glasses (I think), was attractive, and wore a green print dress that was loose, filmy, and seductive.  Somehow I propositioned her, perhaps only implicitly by standing before her in a semi-nude state, but she stalked away.  <p
