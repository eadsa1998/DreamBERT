I was at a place like a prisoner of war camp thing. I was in a room with beds. My 'bed' was a group of people. Elijah was one of them. The people in the block next to us always yelled at them complaining about sheets. I realized one of ours had never been washed. Later the leader died. Elijah, someone else and I were talking and Elijah came to the conclusion that the replacement was going to be evil. They were standing in line and were all young females. One was really tall and Elijah was staring at her. One had a big mole. We were messing around and she tried to kick something and then realized it was hers. Elijah was annoyed because the tall girl was taller than him. Gizmo was in a cage with a lizard. I let her out. Mom let the lizard out and it bit me and I squealed. I ran and screamed and it chased me. This teacher lady gave a quiz to Fatima. I wanted to do it and she said it was mainly for guys. At the top it said to text this number to get your name. I was on IMDb and there was a 'Top 10 quotes' thing. I said "I watch 8/10 of these shows", although there were repeats. One from Grey's Anatomy was there and a Supernatural quote was number 3. The Supernatural quote had something to do with liking a sandwich and it was a Dean quote. Later I was at a table/desk and Milo Ventimiglia was next to me and I think we knew each other. There was a movie about a war with Susan Sarandon? She left to go to James Spader, then it was from his point of view but it was 'me'. He (as me) walked into a house and she was on a lounge reading. I went up to her and hugged her. There were people there watching.
