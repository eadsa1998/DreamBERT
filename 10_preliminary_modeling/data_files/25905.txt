 I'm in Australia with others. We're at a liquor store. My grade school classmate Gino Teavor exits with a six-pack of Pepsi or beer, and wants my to buy it for him, since I'm 21. I will buy it and he'll pay me back. My friend Tom Napper says he'll get 12 Miller Genuine Drafts. I say not to, and offer to split a 12-pack with him, which we agree upon. The beer is expensive. Someone finds my wallet, which is my old black wallet, on the floor. I have a lot of money in it. I think I may bring some money home after the trip to Australia. I buy the beer, and get Gino some Moosehead. There is an Australian man who is buying something after me. He is short a couple dollars and asks us to give him money. I hesitantly give him two dollars. He needs $1.50 more. Someone else has change so he shoves a dollar back in my shirt pocket angrily, and gets the change he needs from the other man. I go out of the store, turn right, and start to follow some women down the street. I hop over a green bicycle. I don't keep following them, but turn into a bar-like area that seems to be attached to the liquor store. I see my friend Jill Banks at a table with two other people, one who looks familiar. Jill starts laughing at me as I walk towards her. I know she is laughing at my facial hair. I think: I don't need this ridicule, and I turn around and leave. I walk by my high school classmate Mya Rousing at a table and say hi. I don't say anything else even though I know she'd like to talk. I keep walking. I find the table where we are sitting. My friends Stephen and Jose Ramos, Gino, Tom, Emily Zates, and others are there. I only bought a six-pack of Miller Genuine Draft; I forgot I was splitting a 12-pack with Tom. Emily got a 30-pack of "Party of Five" for $19! That is a lot of beer, cheap! I think maybe I should get some of that to hold us over. An older man there walks by. He asks us whose breath smells. Tom says something in reply. The man then says that it's Tom's breath!
