I dreamed that I was trying to turn on one of the lights in our house, but when it wouldn't  go on I began pulling harder and harder at the chain. All of a sudden the whole fixture came down and fell into a wastebasket--since the light bulb had somehow become extremely hot, I was afraid that the contents of the wastebasket would. catch fire and might possibly spread elsewhere.
