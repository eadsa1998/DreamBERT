I dreamt that I was with some friends in the living room of my home. We were strangely dressed, with cowboy boots and hats and long suede vests. We were in a row and my little brother (aged 10) appeared and made my slacks (which were light blue) dirty with a rag. In real life I have no such slacks or boots, but I do have a hat like that. This made me angry and I shoved the boy lightly so that he would go away, to which he reacted by attacking me. My mother, who ordinarily sides with him, scolded him this time, which satisfied me. I don't remember any more.
