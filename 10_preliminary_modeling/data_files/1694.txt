The Arkansas Dream. Jolene and I are somewhere. A man comes by. I tell him Jolene is going to Arkansas and I tell her he's from my Arkansas hometown. He's either an old friend or a cousin. I am also aware I've rarely or never been to Arkansas. Before she goes, we decide to go down some stairs (even though I'm in a wheelchair. It's a bumpy ride.) We get to an open place. Jim, the community college priest, is fat and smiley. He comes over and tells me he's going to buy some illicit drugs. He puts on a see through plastic bag and goes to a sale table. I am quite surprised at this. I also see a woman wearing an old-fashioned, long skirted ruffly dress in Scotts plaid. Her plastic bag has the same plaid. I can't see who she is. I say, "I think I've seen that nightgown before." I then decide to go shopping. I see rows and rows of colorful yarn - pinks, blues, whites and a beautiful Irish knit bedspread. I touch it and notice it is polyester 4 ply, lightweight and slick. But the pattern is pretty. I see several others and think I'd like to have one.
