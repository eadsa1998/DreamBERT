I am in Ireland. I am with Frank and Wendy in a green countryside. I see mountains, green lawns, hedgerows, rivers, very old and beautiful buildings. We go sightseeing; meet people from the Retreat Center. On a boat: we go under water and rise again. Restaurant: meet an old woman, with grey hair and wearing a brown dress; we eat together but Frank and Wendy disappear. I am alone and I have no money. The old woman pays for me and then she gives me a red-brown stone to keep; then she leaves and I am alone again. I can't find Frank and Wendy, but I don't panic. Finally I see them and we go on together.
