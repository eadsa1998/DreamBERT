I was going to a big dance and I was getting ready. I was going with a boy I used to date once it seemed that he was going to come and pick me up. However, before I could go, for some reason I had to go see our family doctor (about 48, male). I went up to his office and sat in the waiting room while he was finishing with the person ahead of me. Finally I went in and right away I sensed that he was dead drunk. He acted very queerly, demanded what I was there for. I told him I had to be examined so I could go to the dance. I was somewhat afraid of him. I remember there were cupboards in his office with all kinds of bottles on them. He examined me very quickly. I don't remember the details of the examination, but I knew it was very short. I left his office very puzzled.
