I am in an older woman's house. I am hungry. I eat a huge piece of chocolate cake with white frothy icing. I wish I was home. I don't like it here. I eat a few M and M's, noticing how quickly they melt in my mouth. I wonder if the sugar will affect my heartbeat but I'm not too worried about it. A small group of people come in and I want to share with them the video tapes of this years performances at the celebration. (Like E City Celebration) They become bored and I say well, then shall we look at the 1st one, 3 years ago? (I remember I'd done some performing in my sexy pink dress and want to show that.) They agree. I ask a man in the group to run the remote control. I say each segment is repeated so be sure and fast forward those parts.
