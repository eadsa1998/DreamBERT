I'm in a warehouse. There are a number of people there working. One of them is Marcia N. Some workers are coming in and asking me and someone else some questions. Marcia N and some of the others are angry because the workers are asking me and because I'm answering them. Now I'm getting upset because I really don't even want to have anything to do with any of it. I'm not guessing on my answers. If I don't know I'm telling them to go ask someone that I know will know the correct answers. Marcia N and these other people are upset because they think we're answering questions that we really don't know the answers too. There is something else about a parade. It might be more than one parade. There are these things, kind of like the large balloons they have in the Thanksgiving Day parade. Only these are made of fabric. I think I may have been responsible for one of them and one of them broke or tore or got damaged and it wasn't my fault. Yet, these employees were blaming me and someone else was defending me and trying to explain that it wasn't really my fault.
