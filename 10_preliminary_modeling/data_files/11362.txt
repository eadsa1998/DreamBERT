I was on a farm and one of the rows broke out. She was fast and I was afraid to try and stop her. But because I didn't, all of the cows started to break out of their stalls. There was great general confusion, all the other people had to come out and help round Up the herd. I was standing in a line where we were passing some small animals from one to the other toward the barn. After several of these small animals had been passed up, they started to pass up a stretcher with a dead man on it, apparently killed by a stampeding cow.
