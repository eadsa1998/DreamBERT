I was at my grandparents house and my friend Dee came downstairs to get some melatonin. Then the next day I was still at their house and this person got shot. The person that shot them looked like Jennifer Aniston (the girl from "Friends"). Then I chased after her and the dream ended. Setting: At my grandparents' house. Characters: My mom, my friend, my grandma and grandpa. I now know all of them. But I don't know the girl that was shot. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared. It was weird and I don't understand why my grandparents were there.
