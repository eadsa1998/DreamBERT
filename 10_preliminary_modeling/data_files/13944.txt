I was on IMDb and the rating of The Dark Knight was 9.5 and it was still number one and all the other movies in the list were random, new ones that wouldn't ever be in the Top 250. I was thinking that all these teenage idiots must've been rating all these lame movies because of The Dark Knight. I was annoyed that One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was now nowhere to be found.
