My dream started off with me at my house and I was walking in front of my garage to the side of my house. I saw two snow tigers in my back yard. At first they didn't do anything, but then they started clawing at the fence. The fence had a nut and bolt and the more they scratched at it, the more it came unloose, but after about one minute they had broken free and came right at me. The bigger one grabbed my left arm, the other my right. I remember sensing another one but it wasn't around. I broke my left arm free and punched the tiger, and as soon as it happened, I felt I was dead and my next dream started.
