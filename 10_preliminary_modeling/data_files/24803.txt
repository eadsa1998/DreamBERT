I had a dream I was in a supermarket and I was the last in there. They were closing, so I was leaving and the store guy says, "Just for your comfort we have Stottie Pippen and Tupac Shakur here." I played b-ball with Scottie Pippen and with Tupak, and I shook both their hands. Setting: In a supermarket, and in the next room a basketball court. Characters: Sharla, a teacher from school; my dad; Scottie Pippen, an NBA player; and the greatest rapper who is now dead, Tupak Shakur. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy. The whole dream was great and I was really excited all this happened.
