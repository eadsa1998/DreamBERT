I was talking with Kogler. He said he was giving away all his fruit this year. We walked by my home and I was showing Kogler my fruit trees. I pointed at a big black walnut tree, then a big apple tree. I looked down on the lower branches and it was loaded with red, ripe apples. Bob and Audrey came by. I said, "Look at the nice apples." They asked for one. I said, "Help yourself, eat as many as you want." We were eating apples and took another one and was this a big apple, about three inches in diameter and about 6 in. long. I was stacking up the papers on the big shot's desk and I always put the Holy Bible on the top. I seemed to be traveling on a trip. I was in Westbrook house and we did some cleaning up, redecorating. There seemed to be a dream of water of something I can't recall now. I was unloading steel bars. I dreamed of bread in some way. I had a lot of it or was looking at it.
