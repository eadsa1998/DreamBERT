I was on a vacation. It seemed like PA. I was fishing and fellows were talking of catching big fish. Then I went to a meeting. I sat on the edge on a chair. Kogler came over and stood beside me. My hands were dirty. I was scraping off the mud with my nails. I was by Grandma's. I was surprised when I looked at the home. Tthey had it enlarged and made fancy or modern. It was extended to the sidewalk and they had a small wall or fence along the sidewalk. I told Mary I would like to see it. I walked into the kitchen and it was remodeled and redecorated. Off the kitchen they had a long hall. I walked thru the hall and looked over the house. They had a lot of flowers in pots growing and the new room was beautiful. It had a nick soft linoleum. In fact, I got down and inspected it. It was a rich carpet. Then I walked into a bedroom and there was Grandpa, my father sleeping. I didn't want to awake him so I walked out, but was sort of lost in the many doors. I finally came out into the hall and started for the kitchen. I sort of skipped and glided thru the air and I heard Grandpa coming and say to Steve, "He's afraid to see me. He's running away from me." I got outside and waited and then awoke. It was at Grandma's home again and I walked into the bedroom where Grandpa was sleeping and I went out again and got into a shoot and slid down to the first floor. I was driving downtown. I thought I saw Ann. It looked like her, but when I got there it was another woman instead of her.
