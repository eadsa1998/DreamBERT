I was going to fence someone but all of the swords didn't have long blades. I asked some buy to fence and he turned out to be my friend's brother. We were talking and he told me he was taking calculus XZ. Then he smiled at me and I think I liked him. He said two nice things to me and said something about the difference in our age. Then he said, "You aren't using my sister to get to me?" I said no and he said, "I don't want my sister to get hurt." Before that, we were at camp and assigned to jobs before the feast. I went downstairs to this beach; someone was telling me about how people died in a volcano here. It reminded me of Mt. Vesuvius. Then me &amp; Jeanette went down a dark road in a car to go grocery shopping even though it wasn't my job. Then I went down stairs to the boys school where my old crush R. went to school. I was looking for him but I couldn't find him. Setting: At camp, at a beach, in Woodside, at an all-boys school. Characters: Frank &amp; R. Both were ex-crushes I had decided that I didn't like any more the night I had the dream. The two girls are my friends. I didn't know who the other person was. Frank looked different than he normally does. I met him like I met my current crush, Eli. Feelings and Thoughts: Anxious, in love, happy, sad. I woke up thinking Frank loved me until I remembered it was only a dream. I was scared when the person told me the people had died in the year 226.
