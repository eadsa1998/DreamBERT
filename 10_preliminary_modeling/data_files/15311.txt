I was at a shop with my schoolbag. I realized after a while that no bags were allowed. I brought it to the front of the store and I took my book and pen out. I took a cheese and cracker snack to eat. The fridge had a freezer section with water. I took a guy to see some creatures in it before. I thought it was 2 years ago but it didn't make sense because they were too big to fit. There were ripples in the water and it was vibrating. I asked him if he saw it and he said 'feck no'. He put his face in the water. Then it was a movie and I was this girl and she said "did you not hear what Manny told you" and he slapped her. A door opened. Manny left and the girl screamed "Manny!". I was watching a video of Greg Sestero on his phone and the acting was really bad and I wondered if I'd seen this before but I didn't think so.
