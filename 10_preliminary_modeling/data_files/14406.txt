I was with Charlie Day? I think he and I were in a place and then he went away for a bit. Someone said a friend was waiting for me and a girl. There were clothes on a rack. There were lots of these black dresses and black pants and white shirts. Then someone was coming and they forced me into a room. I was naked. I couldn't bring any clothes in as this laser thing would detect them and make them disappear. I was really annoyed.
