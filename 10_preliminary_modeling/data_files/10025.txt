I see an acquaintance from Church who is fat and wears a maternity shirt, hanging down very sloppily. She is talking to someone else and I can't talk to her.-- I am on a man's bicycle and ride through snow and slush; the left handlebar comes off and I must steady myself with my right hand with pain.
