I was at school and I got a heap of school clothes and my jumper. There were $2 coins. I put the clothes in a school bag and some in a plastic bag. I was then at a beach place. There was a tornado thing and it was going through the water and it was zig-zagging. I left the plastic bag behind but wouldn't take off my school bag which slowed me down considerably. We ran through a track. Where we were going had been destroyed. We ran back where we came from but it was collapsed in. Calvin, a girl, her brother (he looked and sounded like Chase from House) and I got trapped in this plastic tunnel thing. He liked me and kept making references to the fact. There was a tyre with a thing you blow into. It all melted later and we got out. I accidentally left my shoes. On the way back to get my shoes, Dmitri said that I sucked and kept being gay.
