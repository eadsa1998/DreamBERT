We were at the Technical College and had like 'homeroom' or whatever. Fletcher and Tristan were in the same one. Some lecturers were trying to work out which classes Fletcher had next since he changed. I was in a supermarket with Tristan and some others and we were crawling around to get out. Tristan was in front of me and struggling to get through some of the tighter areas and was going slow, so I did this kind of jump to get ahead. Later, there was an eclipse and we waited it out before the next class. Co-Worker-M-06 and Mason from work were there and I can't remember why but Co-Worker-M-06 admitted to liking me which I thought was weird since he's gay. Later we were in a room with Co-Worker-M-06, Mason, Fletcher, Marcos and someone else. Fletcher and Marcos were on opposite sides of the room, behind me. Someone asked 'ok who thinks Izzy's hot' and Co-Worker-M-06, Mason and the other person out their hand up, I nervously swung my chair around and Fletcher hadn't but then reluctantly put his hand up. Marcos was like 'wait what are we doing' and when they said 'hands up if Izzy's hot' he was like 'ok well I'm in the minority here'. Co-Worker-M-06 said the first day he met me I had 'shyly' asked 'where do I go' and he liked it. I felt uncomfortable and weird and wanted to go home. At some point during the eclipse, I was alone with Co-Worker-M-06 and he said 'we can go somewhere and do stuff' and I said 'I don't want to do stuff and a few seconds later Fletcher walked into the room and I felt awkward. Later I was making a silly short film with this Kiwi guy and wanted him to run about these fields so it would look Hobbit-y. [Fletcher changed class recently because he liked me, and people keep saying 'everyone likes Izzy'].
