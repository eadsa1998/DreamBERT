I had just a short dream in which I was a Texan and had lots of money to give away. I want to give it away to support music or something like that. I didn't like any of the radio stations I heard around Texas. I was going to go elsewhere when I turned on one radio station and heard an opera. I didn't like that particular opera, but thought that was a sign of good cultural activity, so I decided to give lots of my money to Texas radio stations.
