I was dating some guy and then we sort of broke up. Then it was One Tree Hill and he was Nathan and I was Haley. He had then slept with Brooke, in the four days they had spent apart, and he regretted it, but he didn't know whether to tell Haley. In real life, I was trying to sleep. Mom and Ezra kept waking me up. Dad came over to and woke me. I said I didn't get to bed until late. The first time they woke me up I'd only been asleep for about an hour.
