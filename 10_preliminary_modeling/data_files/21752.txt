I was watching a prehistoric monster on a street. He was like an elephant, only about four times as big. He was standing and a woman came down the street and didn't see him. When she got close, he started to move silently towards her, but she accidentally walked into a store, so he went into a store about four doors back and started to go thru doors towards the woman and he was not a monster now because he went thru regular doors. I saw Bill Grove and other people walk down the street where the monster would come out, but to my surprise I thought the monster was coming towards us and now it was a giant elephant instead and more to my surprise, he was just a big image balloon that men were carrying along. I saw 6-8 and 7-5 or was repeating it or someone told me. I'm not quite sure.
