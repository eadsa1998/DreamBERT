I was looking for Margie S. in New York City. She lived off one of he side streets and had to go thru a store to her rooms. I met her and she took me to her rooms and laughed that I would not be able to find her place. When I came out, I looked at the children playing in the street. There were tall buildings all around and I thought what a life these kids had in the stuffy city, bad air and no place to play.
