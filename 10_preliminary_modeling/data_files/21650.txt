I came to a cherry tree. It was full of black, ripe cherries. It was on a tree lawn. I went in and asked if I could pick some cherries and the woman said, "Come in," and the man said I could pick the cherries, but he would hold the ladder as I picked and we would divide the cherries. I agreed with him. I seemed to have seen deep as a winner.
