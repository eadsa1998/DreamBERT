 I'm in a Target store with my friend Kevin Simpson. There is a liquor section, which we are in, buying beer. A grade school teacher of mine, Liza Minikel, is there. I ask her if she'll buy beer for us, and she agrees. There is a police officer there. He stops Liza from buying beer for us. Liza gets a big fine of $240 or $280 dollars for attempting to buy us beer. I get a $10 fine. We all walk away. I feel guilty, and I think of offering to split her fine between her and Kevin and I.
