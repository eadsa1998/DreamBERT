We were watching some show of Ashton Kutcher's. Mom and I went to a house with others. Their TV was stingy quality. Mom saw a set of books about insects in the bookshelf and was like 'I love these!' and chatted to the people. We went to leave and Darren was asking about the TV. Mom and I drove somewhere. It was night. We went to a petrol station to get those fruit biscuits with chocolate on them. As we left, this black guy came out into the street with a knife. We drove off and went around. We came back around and another guy was there (a white guy). I got out of the car and ran. I heard a noise and I saw the car drive off. I ran back and Mom was on the ground. We saw him trying to scam some guy and we warned him. There was a Labrador puppy and we told him to warn someone else. He was actually a bad guy but he helped us. This guy shot some people and there were a few left. I said we had to help each other now. I walked past this pyramid which I had to search for a quest on World of Warcraft. Ezra wanted to go to some artifact thing.
