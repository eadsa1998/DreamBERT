 I'm in a large pole barn-like structure. It's nighttime. People are sleeping, lying on rolled out mats and sleeping pads. I go to my friend Kevin Simpson, who is asleep, and take his keys. He consents to this, sleepily. There is a wicker basket in which there are many small animals, including two white kittens. They are tiny, about the size of small rodents. They squirm around like newborns.
