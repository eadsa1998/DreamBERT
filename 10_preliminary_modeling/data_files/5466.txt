Last night I first dreamed that I had to throw another surprise party for Alondra and bake her a cake and buy her a camera. I really didn't want to since I had already thrown her a surprise party. I was in Wal Mart or something and then I realized that Sydney's birthday was coming up too. I wanted to do something for her so I bought a gluten-free cake too. Then I was at home and I think I had a test or something the next day. I was anxious about something. Drake came into my room and we were fooling around a bit. Then he left for a moment (to get water, maybe?) and I had the most intense orgasm I've ever had in real life or in dreams. It was so powerful and still going when Drake came back. I insisted that we have sex that instant, but then my parents walked in and it was horrible! Drake was mortified, and I was furious. I think my parents just tried to ignore what was happening. Drake was so embarrassed that we would have to have dinner with them later.
