I was writing down a dream about Robert Downey Jr., where he had been at Nana's (which was totally different), looking through these photo albums. He had also been driving really fast. I couldn't remember if I'd written it down or not. [When I woke up, I thought it was a dream I'd had, until a week later when I went through them and realized it wasn't].
