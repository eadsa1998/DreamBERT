I can't remember properly, but it was like, the end of the world. We were all packed on trains. They would stop now and then. There were also different trains and they would look for certain people, etc. Anyway, I was with JD (Scrubs). At one stop, we found a room and had sex. It looked like my room and we were in the dark and I was on top. It was weird, because I remember all of it. Later, I found out I was pregnant. Elliot (Scrubs) was also looking for JD because she wanted a baby, but I think when she found out about us, she just went looking for anyone. I think if you were pregnant you either had privileges or didn't have to do something. Sometimes trains would get close and you could jump to a new one. We did and ended up at a cinema. I was then with Calvin and they had this really fast rollercoaster and we got in the back of it and then quickly let go. There was a room with a stage and people were dancing. I was with Elliot now. The president, who was Laura Roslin (Battlestar Galactica) was there. A big ball of smoke came in through a vent at the top of the wall behind the stage. It then spread out we all lied down. Roslin tried to redo the dance, some dancers slipped off etc (because of the smoke). I said to Elliot that she was an idiot and then she was like "hey, I'm the president!". She then worked it out and a bunch of us were still lying on the floor. I was listening to my iPod and I took one earphone out to listen to her speak. She said that no-one was listening and I put my hand up and said "I'm listening!". We left there and I was then with Dad, Ezra, Poppa and Poppers and we were walking outside. We had to pick up "Quincy from England" and Mom from home. I asked "Are we still in America?". We found this pub/saloon thing. We went upstairs and there were two muffins. Poppers then wanted some Coke. Dad gave him a warm glass (without any Coke). I was carrying heaps of stuff and got stuck on the stairs and no-one would help.
