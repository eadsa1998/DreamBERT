I was in a mountain pass in the warlines in the 1860's. Down at the foot of the mountain was a small mining town. Some other members of the fraternity to which I belong joined me. They had been attacked and driven out of the town by members of another fraternity. I said that we should retake the town by force if necessary. I urge it even though they are better armed than we are since we outnumber them. I was abruptly awakened by my alarm clock.
