I had a kid. The house I lived at was very small but was 2-3 storeys. I was talking to my boyfriend about it saying the kid needed more room. The kid was running and I called out "Brad!" (the kid) and I was thinking 'why did I call him Brad?'. He asked me if he could say some stupid words (maybe swear words in our world?) and I said he couldn't say them in front of anyone. Then I was at Mom's. There was a bed near the kitchen. We were all sleeping in those rooms (the house was different). I decided to use my 'proper' bed tonight and I forgot there was a big window. Mom suggested I put the bed against the wall under the curtain. I said it would be too bright. I was watching 24 and Jack was watching movies and doing some US test?
