We were on a boat, I think, and we crashed, but I don't remember it. I was at some place, with the guys from Monty Python, and we were friends. We all had to climb this strange thing (like that game at the Royal Show, when you climb up a blown up thing, but it always tips over) and then press or grab something. If this bird cuckooed then we won heaps of money. We climbed up and after a certain time, it makes you fall. Terry Jones was running the whole show, but he was also climbing, so I think maybe he had a look-alike. He was falling and somehow I pressed mine and his button thing, not at the same time. I won $1.4 million. Then I was playing Neopets and it was money that I had on there. Then I had it in real life again.
