I was sitting maybe in the hallway. Trying to organize things into categories. But really it was a waste of time because the system of organization I was attempting made NO SENSE. And it would really be confusing for the girl I was suppose to leave it for--in a canvas bag. And she didn't even know me. I decided to scrap it all and start over. I noticed the window on the top floor of a high rise and on the outside of the window was another white canvas bag. This one,not sure, and I wanted it so I had to open the window and back out. A lady came out the door and needed to take the elevator down. It was making strange noises so I said, "I think you better walk down the stairs."
