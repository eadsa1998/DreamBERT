I dreamed I was at a small house. Larry and May and Paul were there, they had just got back from somewhere and were tired. Paul needed something, he was crying, but Larry and May ignored him so I went to him. He was able to talk which was very surprising. He said he wanted to go to the back porch. I told May that Paul could talk. In the living room I saw Mica and Annette. Annette was walking and I asked her if she remembered me. She said "from August." Then she turned into a curly-haired white dog running around. Then something else happened -- a sheriff was there in the house -- someone had let him in without a search warrant. Alan gave me Ned√ïs marijuana and I went out back to a barn full of furniture to hide it.
