I was coming home from church and it seemed as if I was with F. who is thirty nine years of age and with whom I used to go with, but whom I don't see any longer. It seemed he stopped to get some ice cream and I took the opportunity to go home without him. I think I felt that I didn't want him to come home with me. When I got home I took my father out to the porch. It seemed as if I just picked him up in my arms, he was so little. After a while F. came up to the house and I introduced him to my father. I felt as if I didn't want F. to see that my father was so ill. Then F. took the ice cream to the ice box. I told him I would be in in just a few minutes, but I didn't. When I did go back there was a note from him saying he had gone. I remember my father asking me if I was interested in him; he hoped not because he seemed too old for me - I assured him that I wasn't interested in him.
