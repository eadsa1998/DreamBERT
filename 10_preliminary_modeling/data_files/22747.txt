In the second dream I got on the bus that takes me to the university and I went by an avenue where there are many buildings. And I had just gone through the street, when there was an earthquake and the car stopped and the last building fell right in front of where the bus had stopped. I immediately thought of my mother, since that place is near my home. then I rushed towards my own house because in the dream my mother lived on the 15th floor, and I arrived at the building and the only floor that had cracks was that one, but nothing had happened to her.
