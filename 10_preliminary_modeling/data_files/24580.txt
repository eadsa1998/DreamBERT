My grandma came back from the dead, and took me for a ride and gave me a big toy store that was all mine. It had a cash register full of money. Setting: First in the car, second in a toy store. Characters: My grandma and me. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, sad, scared. I was happy that my grandma was back with me. Then scared that she was back from the dead, and sad because she was gone. (P.S. I'd do anything to get my grandma back and running like the day before she died. I love and loved her with all my heart forever.)
