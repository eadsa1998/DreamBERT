I drove to the vet for work experience and then remembered I wasn't going anymore and drove back home. It was raining heavily. The cars in front of me were driving slowly. Then I was doing volunteer work until 7pm and it was almost 5. I was sweaty. There was an area with famous people. There were lots of paths and flowers. Then I was at a shop. Harry, Hermione and Ron (Harry Potter) were there. A guy was doing something with them and Hermione was giggling whenever Ron was mentioned and I was annoyed because I liked him too. Ron's brothers and the three of them did something 'naughty', so a guy had emptied their bank accounts and punished them, but because Ron didn't talk back he was let off, then his brothers threatened the guy and they were allowed to go too. The guy was now Timothy Spall. Harry was in the lolly section and got some alcohol and got drunk. Something happened and this creature was released (size of the monster in Gwoemul). It burst through and we all ran. I got in the car with Mom, who had been waiting, and it put its foot on the bonnet and breathed onto the windscreen. I said "don't move" and it smashed the window, but then left. I ended up back inside with it and we were trapped in. I was hiding around and it was being mean to others, but it was not bad to me. Seamus was with me. All of a sudden, it started singing Ask the Lonely loudly, but with modified lyrics, eg "close the windows and toilets". We laughed.
