I had an excursion which was like a sequel to one we'd gone to in year 11, that I hadn't gone to. Calvin came. We were told to go to this meeting room after lunch. At lunch Calvin, Eugene, others and I were in the room. We realized no-one else was there and I said "where is everyone?" and Eugene said "I dunno". We walked out and everyone was sitting in chairs and a guy was talking. Ms Solomon gave us gel stuff to put everywhere there was hair. It made my hand look nicer. I was naked and she was putting it in my hair and I was covering myself. I was looking in a mirror and I let go and saw my boobs and quickly covered back up. Some guy with a really squished up face said hello to Calvin (first, we were in a tree along with Spaceman and had gone to run away and I had trouble getting down). He had annoyed Calvin last year but obviously didn't get in trouble for it. He kept hurting him and me to a lesser extent. He was trying to drown me at one point. I went into a room to hide. The excursion was a 'study' excursion and there was a lady in there. I told her I was doing biology study, but she made me study a map of Spain.
