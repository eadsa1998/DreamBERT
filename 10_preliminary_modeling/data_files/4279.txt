["George W. Bush Jr. cooks for me."] I am in my bed, somewhere, sleeping. I wake up to discover George W. Bush Jr. cooking some soup for me as a demonstration of his cooking skills. He is a candidate for President. I ask him at least three questions and he does not respond. It's as though he is deaf or concentrating so hard he can't hear me. I get out of bed when he pours the soup, which appears to be vegetable. I take the cup and see only a small amount of broth in the bottom. I sip it. I can not taste or smell anything but I say Oh, how good. Thank you. He still doesn't respond.
