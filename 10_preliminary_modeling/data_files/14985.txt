I was driving with Mom. There was a cop on the road and he pulled this yellow gun out. We stopped and he wanted the car. I said I didn't have shoes on and he settled for us driving him somewhere. We went to a shop for clothes. Also, Roland liked Samantha and she 'tried to be bad'. She had been pretending to date this guy and he found out and was upset.
