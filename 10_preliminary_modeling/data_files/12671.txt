I went to this school that was being rebuilt with Mom and Ezra. Ezra and I used to play there (it got burnt down). There were these twins (they were little kids) and we met one who said her name was Laura, the other was called Michelle. We went into this building. There was a movie quiz thing. I passed but hurt my feet. This guy before me got it to. There was this girl which was part of this group and they were vampires or something. I got out of the building and got to the car.
