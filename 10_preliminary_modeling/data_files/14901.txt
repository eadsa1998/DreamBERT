I was sitting in my car. I was at school. Some kids were playing around outside. I wound the windows up and locked the doors. This older girl came. One of them was a second cousin of mine. I had only known them for a while. The older girl was trying to get in the front window. I pushed her out and wound the window up. She could reach her fingers through the door handle from the outside. I got in the drivers seat and drove off. I was looking for somewhere to park it. Mom came and we left. A long time later, I went back and they had found it (the car). We gathered items for a quest, which was called Toad Hunter. The rest of my group wanted to do it tomorrow.
