 I'm riding a bicycle on the route that I used to take cutting through yards on the way to school. I don't hold onto the handlebars, but hold onto a different part of the front of the bicycle, like the brake cable. This doesn't work as well for steering. I decide I could steer better if I used the handlebars, so I grasp them. The bicycle is an old 10-speed, with fat tires. I go down the alley behind the "A" house on Bauer Avenue. I encounter my dad, who is working in the garage of a house near the "A" house. He is repairing a wheel chair over his lunch break and has to go back to the hospital soon to work. As I pull up the front tire and fork go completely wayward, detaching from the frame because of a loosened neck bolt. I talk to my dad to see if he has a 9/16" wrench handy to tighten it. I tell him I heard he was out fishing. I'm happy and excited about fishing: it's great he could go, and I'm excited to go.
