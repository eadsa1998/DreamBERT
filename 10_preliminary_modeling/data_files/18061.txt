I was at school and then aliens came in their spaceship and they said, "Pack up right now". so the kids in the my class and me got our stuffed animals and our blankets and we put them in this thing in the aliens spaceship and they said to take your sneakers off too. Then we got on the ship and we rode all the way up to the moon where the aliens lived. We had a great time there. We loved the aliens; they were really fun to play with. They were green with black eyes. The things that we had on they asked "what is that?" then we had to go back to school to the gym. I cried when we had to say goodbye but they said we will see you next time. I was glad of that because I really liked the aliens and than all of a sudden the spaceship was gone in a pack of dust but what was coming down from the spaceship was a little picture of all the aliens and of course we would see the aliens again but not today.
