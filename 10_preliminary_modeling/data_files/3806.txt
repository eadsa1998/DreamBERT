["Can't remember my Lines."] Lucy and I are driving to a gig. We pull off at the place we think the gig is supposed to be. We walk around looking for it, occasionally asking someone where it is. No one seems to know. I try to read my written instructions but it is faded and unclear. I say it must be right over there. We drive and suddenly see the freeway stops dead in it's track with a huge drop off to nowhere. We are startled and relieved we noticed it before we drove over the edge. We turn and find a place to stop. We sit down on the sidewalk to think about it. I suddenly realize I didn't rehearse or bring my scripts and desperately try to remember the ADA skit. Lucy is a bit upset with me. I say I even forgot the Evangeline hats. That really upset her. Now she wants to give up finding the place and going home. I say Katrina will be upset, what will she do? She had asked us to do this for a staff meeting. Lucy says she'll figure out something else. I want to agree but feel bad about not trying harder. I am mad at myself for not preparing better. Now a woman comes up to Lucy and sits on the sidewalk next to her. She asks if she wants a hit. I turn my head away saying no. But Lucy says yes. The woman lights up a marijuana cigarette and shares it with Lucy. But suddenly Lucy jumps up and yells get away from me. I am startled. I think that the woman made a sexual pass at Lucy.I see the woman's oddly blue-veined breast, exposed. But Lucy says "You are Sister Mary Ellen." The woman leaves and Lucy tells me in a disjointed way that she was a media victim and this woman was a part of it and she is very upset with her. Another man comes by who was a part of that time and Lucy and he talk about it. Now we agree to return home. I pick up our red car and turn it around and place it on the fast lane of the freeway back home. I tell Lucy to hurry and get in before the oncoming traffic catches up. I drive away quickly.
