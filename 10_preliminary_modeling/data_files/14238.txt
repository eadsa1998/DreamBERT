It was the future/just different. People had to be under a certain level of intelligence [watched an episode of The Twilight Zone last night like that]. We had to take tests. There were lots of Asians around. There were a bunch of people who had cheated on the test and I was one of them and we were 'rebels' against the Government or something. I was in a taxi with Mom and Darren. We were all sitting in the back. I saw Samantha walking down a road, near her house (she had a 10-15 minute walk) and I thought they were going to get her, but they didn't. Ezra was now there and he asked why she wasn't at University and I said "University hasn't started yet nub". The driver was Asian. I had this male Asian friend.
