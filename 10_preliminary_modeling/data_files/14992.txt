I was at university in a lab. It was a big class and we were separated into two groups. I ended up with eight people. We followed someone and two others and I were at the back. Then we were on a train and we had to run and jump to get on. We got to where we were going but then I realized I had forgotten my bag, but I hadn't. Then we had to do a dissection of a monkey, but it was still alive, which made me upset. Dad was watching and I cried and sobbed and he was like 'what the hell are you crying for?' and I said 'it's whimpering'. I forgot to draw it in my lab book, but I got a photo of something else. There was an online quiz and if you 'passed' you got to be lead photographer. Dad came to help me with it.
