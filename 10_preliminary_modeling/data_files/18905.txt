I was on a bus travelling on an expressway. But this bus was also a roller coaster and the expressway was its track. The only person I recognized in the bus was a casual acquaintance from school. When we reached my stop, the coaster-bus turned onto a ramp leading to the ground. Suddenly I felt the wind howl outside and the bus was pushed along faster. Someone shouted, "We're going to crash," and I felt the bus jump the end of the track. I awoke as it crashed. [anxious, afraid, unpleasant, no color]
