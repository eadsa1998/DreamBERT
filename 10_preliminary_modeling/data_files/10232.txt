At Church: long sequence of dance classes which I help teach. (Liturgical dances?) I see Father Andrew and Marissa Camden walk down a CORRIDOR: Marissa looks old and fat and senile. I reach them just as Father Andrew is about to close a folding door. He is wearing a black cassock and carries a FLASHLIGHT. I see him kiss Marissa's hand quite ardently. Then I run back UP the corridor and see a mother with a retarded child; (unknown).-I see WALLY who has cooked ham and eggs very well.
