It is Friday at 20 of 6. I am packing my briefcase to go home after a long week. I'm standing up. I see Dana coming towards my office. I feel tired and annoyed. I think, "Where's Andrea?," and I realize she's gone home and can't be reached by phone. I see I'm the only one around to help. I sigh. He comes in, sits down and sighs. He tells me how depressed and lonely he is and how he's thinking of suicide again. I resent his clinging to me emotionally. I guess he feels that he gets to talk out of the office. He says that he'll go now and maybe find someone else or maybe kill himself. I really get annoyed now because he's playing a manipulative game. I firmly yell down the hall, "Get back here! I'll work with you for 25 minutes. Quit playing these games! If you continue playing them, I'll wash my hands of you and you can do what you will with your life." He comes back angry at me. He wants sex. I say, "No, I don't want to." He says I'm mean, that I have no feelings and that I don't care for him. I say, "I care for you as a human being. I'll hug you, but that's all." He grabs me hard like he'll never let go. I hug him, truly feeling care for him. Then I release him and send him on his way. I' feeling food! I'd done what I could and left room and energy for me. I said no to a "stray kitten!" [BL]
