Something to do with the SVSDC. I know that Brandy C and Lilly H were both there. There were other people there that I didn't know. I must have been at the sleep center but I had some three ring binders that I was going through. They were my personal binders but I found some documentation in them that belonged to the sleep center. I pulled those out and gave them to Lilly H and asked her to put them back where they belong, with the sleep center files. There was something about the insurance. I had asked them who was doing that now and they said no one. I said, You mean they decided to just go back to not collecting from the insurance companies. They said they thought that the hospital had hired, maybe an outside service, to do the insurance work. Maybe even for all the departments but I don't know.
