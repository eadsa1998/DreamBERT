I am getting ready to move into Smith's apartment which he had rented to B. (a fellow research student). I go over to the apartment and look it over. It has pools of water, frogs, odd shaped rooms, partitions and many oriental carved art objects made of wood. They belong to the apartment. Smith introduces me to a woman he is walking with and I wonder what she's got that she can be so friendly with him? But then Smith takes me by the waist and we walk down together. He must leave, but later he calls on the telephone and there is a lot of noise. "What about that guy Boris?" And I realize that he is jealous. He says I want to see you before our next appointment. "I want to see you to -- love." I can hardly hear him for the terrific noise in the phone. I ask "when?" and I believe he says, "tonite." Very happy.
