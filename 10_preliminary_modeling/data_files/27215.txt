I do not know where this dream took place, only that it was in a mountainous region. I alone, was climbing up the side of a mountain with only the earth and weeds to cling to. As I climbed the earth crumbled beneath me but I did not fall. People were below watching in amazement. Only one person can I vividly remember; a girl about 32 years old with whom I worked in a shoe factors in C--. She kept saying I would not get to the top, but I did and I can remember vividly, pulling myself over the top and then being able to walk on flat land, feeling free and happy. The people disappeared and there was just I and miles of flat land ahead of me. Dream ended.
