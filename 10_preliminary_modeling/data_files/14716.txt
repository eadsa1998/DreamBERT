I was at university and it was night. I went into this shop to leave and Matilda and some guy were in there playing with a ball (sometimes they were aliens). I went to walk out one door and Matilda said to go through this other door (which would be quicker). I said that it was always locked and so went through another one. The problem with this door is that it led out onto a long path and some steps and there were no lights. People got attacked all the time on it. I text Mom to come to the back to get me and to text me when she got there. I saw Sherilynn Fenn wave at me from a window, which I assumed meant that it was safe and so started along. I was later reading something on IMDb about Dawson's Creek and whether they thought Dawson was a good filmmaker. They gave Pacey a rating of 40% on filmmaking. There was an episode where Dawson walked in on Pacey masturbating to his own sex tape. I can't remember which girl it was though.
