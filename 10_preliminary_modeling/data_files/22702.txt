The dream I had last night was horrible. A lady told me that in Europe they thought there could still be a cataclysm in Peru, because it seems that a mountain has loosened and it has to return to its place. My dream was horrible. I dreamt that there was a cataclysm and it looked like we were in the streets of France because the city streets were like alleys, narrow and with unpainted bricks. It looked more like England. I think that some people, a good many, were saved, and I was with my mother. She was desperate and I tried to calm her and told her that she had to think. Then I saw that water was coming and going, the sea had come out and everyone ran, scared. It seems that this was in olden times, the people wore long dresses (women) and the men wore hats. I remember there was a policeman and they shot at those who were running. Many people died. At that point, midnight, I awoke with panic. The dream was rather strange because I remember I also saw those streets as jails. I saw bars and I felt trapped. It was nighttime, there were lamps everywhere. It looked like a port, but it was an unknown place. Most of the people were adults. I awoke very tired and with a slight headache.
