I was doing some chemistry online. People were discussing flashcards and some were doing it on the computer and others doing it 'the long way'. I was then with Jared Padalecki and we, and some others, had to go on a flight because I had to deliver something for Nathan Fillion. The flight would take all day and we had to go to two different US states, but it was different and they were like different countries, but all together. On the way there, Jared and I were talking to someone foreign and there were subtitles. I got someone's subtitles confused with his and he got hit by a car. I apologized and his eyes went black and I realized he was a demon. I got away and grabbed Jared and said "he's a demon". I also clearly remember calling out "Jared!" at some point. Then we were near an outdoor eating place. Demons came and we hid in the bushes and Jared fought them. One came up from behind and stabbed me. Jared got angry and upset and killed them all in a rage. Then, I was watching Lost. Some others and I broke into a school. We hid in a room to hide from demons. Heaps of us were sitting around the wall. Then a few guys and girls and I broke into another place to escape. Sawyer (Lost) was there too to escape the island. There were some people there and I think we killed them. There was a big guy and one of us went to him and the big guy shot him. They took us to a room. A lady said that certain people had to go somewhere and she said she'd seen something and that "There was a blade". I had been hiding and I stood up and she was above this girl with sores on her feet. She was wearing open shoes (toes were covered, but that other bit was showing). Then she called me out to go with Jacob (Lost). I was annoyed by it. He was sitting with others on a high table. I went to climb up and they put a pineapple in the way and I was like 'how am I supposed to get up?' and then he was the actor and said sorry. Jacob was actually evil as well.
