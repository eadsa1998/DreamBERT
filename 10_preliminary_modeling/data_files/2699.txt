I am seated in the front row of the audience with friends (Bonnie, Tyler). I now get up and walk up the steps of the raked auditorium (like a school gym, M City High, the old one). I go higher and higher, noticing that the higher I go, the fewer people there are, and the "lower" the intellect and class they have. I reach the top and it's just empty seats. I walk across to the righthand aisle and walk down. Some of the steps are like steep dirt banks I have to jump. I get almost down to where I was and cross again to the left and then return to my seat. As I pass my friends, they excitedly tell me that a Fire Fair is going to happen, like I'll be thrilled, but I'm a bit annoyed because it's like when people tell me some thing about disability, I've heard it all before and I do have other interests besides disability.
