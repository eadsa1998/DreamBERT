I kept going to a locker that was supposed to have been assigned to me in a swimming pool clubhouse, but the key didn't work. The place outside was like the downtown of the town where I went to high school, with the pier 1 imports and rooms to go and other places I don't like.  I had people from work with me. I was trying to do work, but it was difficult. Some friends traveled with me as I tried to find a store that was selling the thing I needed then -- a computer or a car.
