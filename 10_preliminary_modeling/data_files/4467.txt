["Lovely visuals."] I am asked to help do a reading of a play or skit. I am in a room. Sort of a cafe. I am handed a book that unfolds like a brochure, the pages bound at the top. I leaf through it, really surprised and interested in the colorful pictures. I have a hard time finding the dialogue. The words. They are far and few between. I am with a group. After we finish that bit, we are improving bits. I am dancing and singing. It is fun. Someone has a video camera, the dream ego is looking through it as people in the room see it on them,. they respond by talking to it, even while I am doing my bits. It is all in fun.
