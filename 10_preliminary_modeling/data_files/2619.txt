There is a grand piano. A man (graduate student) is about to give a demonstration of his work. He calls out the title, "59 Flamenco Dancers" and is about to start playing, when he pauses to listen. He hears someone else playing, a ghost pianist. I listen. No, that's just the typist (I hear fast typing). Then I hear fast piano music (like Flight of the Bumblebee). I now agree, it's the ghost pianist. Now the piano position is changed and there are two of them. They are positioned closer to a stage area for performance. There are some things on a shelf on the piano - big gulp plastic cups and other things. They start to shake and move. The ghost shows us his presence. Then the ghost picks me in my wheelchair up and we fly around the room fast. I'm not afraid, but excited like on a carnival ride.
