I dreamed that the parents of a boy I have known for over a year came to our house for dinner. I have never met his parents, but I have heard much about them. We were having a buffet dinner and eating on a card table placed at the foot (sidewalk end) of the driveway. The card table kept collapsing. Finally I saw another card table top in the driveway, so I tore the present top off the wobbling legs and put the other top on. Then I noticed a deep pit where the top had been lying. I went to look for some boards to cover the hole with, and when I found some and went back to the driveway, the hole was gone. I don't know what happened to the parents.
