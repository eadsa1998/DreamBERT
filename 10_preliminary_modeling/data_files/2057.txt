I'm in a room, seated in a rocking chair in a square pen (like a play pen). I am holding a 2-year-old baby in my arms. She's relaxed and resting. I am rocking and cuddling her. We are going to nap together. My mother shows me a gift she bought for my father. She got it months ago at the Expo. It's for xmas. It's a big fold-out display with things on it. I lay down with the baby. Now we're in a tent. I place my head near the rear flap to get fresh air. Someone points out how badly the fireplace chimney is smoking. I say that's because of the high winds. Lots of smoke is coming through the vents and the fireplace/stove looks swollen like there's lots of pressure from inside.
