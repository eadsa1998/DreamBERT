I was driving to take something to Vince P and Sue P. They weren't where they used to be. Someone gave me directions to where they are living now. I couldn't believe it. It was in the poorest part of town. They were living in a little shanty, with no windows. It was a mess, with stuff everywhere. They were looking a little rough also. I hesitated to go any further because I didn't want them to be embarrassed. On the other hand, I didn't want them to think it was a big deal to me either. They seemed to welcome me easy enough. Twice while I was there I had to use the bathroom. Then it seemed as though all these little shanties shared a bathroom that had maybe three or four stalls. The stalls didn't have walls. It was all open. I just made sure I locked the door when I went in. I don't remember why I was there. I saw Steve B and Valerie B come in. I was talking a little to Valerie B. I said that this must be very difficult for her. She said that it was and that it made her fairly angry that they had done this to her business. Someone said something about the way they were living now and my coming there. I said that it doesn't really bother me at all. I told them that I have a sister that lives in a situation somewhat similar to this. I said the only thing that bothers me is that I am concerned that the person who lives here might feel uncomfortable to have me come here, that they might be embarrassed.
