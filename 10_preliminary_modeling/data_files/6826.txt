I am walking around our apartments with a visitor going up and down stairs. Finally I say I will go no further with her.  And tell a boy of 3 or 4 years old to come with me and I wipe the yellowish crusts from his eyes. Ask if it doesn't hurt, it is so much worse than mine. (Was having similar trouble with my eyes. Saw dark eye very clearly.) I dampen a Kleenex and it wipes off rather easily but one bit slips in his eye and there's a dead fly and another speck in. He complains of something in his eye. I get the last bits out easily and wonder how the child can hold his eye open so well.
