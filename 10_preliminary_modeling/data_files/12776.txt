The Earth 'died'. Dad and Ezra were at home. I was trying to lock the door, but only the chain was working. I had to stop people coming in (there were some people left). Dad said we only had to worry about that for a few more weeks. It was hard to lock the door when someone came, because they would try and barge in. I was upset because I wasted most of my life at school and was annoyed that I was never going to do anything. I was then at Mom's. Some band was playing nearby. Margarita was outside and I slammed the door in her face. Later she tried to hurt me through the cat door. I was friends with some of the band. Then I was someone else. I liked one of the guys in the band. This girl was going to have sex with his virgin brother, but she had her period and said "How about Tuesday?". 'I' was kissing some guy. This doctor guy shot himself. These soldier guys came. I went to a shop with Mom. This evil dude tried to get in the car, but I drove off. I 'fell' over curbs and stuff, but made it back.
