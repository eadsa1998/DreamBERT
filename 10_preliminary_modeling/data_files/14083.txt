I was with Mom. She had been friends with The Spice Girls. I asked her how they became friends. Then we were in a car and Feels Like I'm in Love was playing. I was singing along to it. Ezra was in the back. The guys from Entourage were in there too. Someone told Vince I had liked him when I was younger and he was teasing and flirting with me. Eric said "there's a problem, you, Vince" and I said "I was going to say that". He wanted to go to this Chinese restaurant. Turtle did something for me and I said "Thanks Turtle". This girl hurt her leg and she was a cheerleader. Some people were undercover somewhere.
