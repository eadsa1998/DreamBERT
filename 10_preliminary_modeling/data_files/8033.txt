I was with my phd classmates. I don't know where we were but it was really cold. The places that were to sleep were like long rectangular, or long cubes may be the best way to describe it. Long hollow squares. Several of us would sleep in each one, two deep and two high and two across, eight of us. These were outside. Because it was so cold we had to dress really warm. It was kind of like a survivor show. We left one at a time. About half of us were left and I was still there. I was thinking that I had a good chance of being the last one to go because I get along well with everyone and I don't cause a lot of problems. There was something about laptop computers. Carmen A and Julien D were both still there.
