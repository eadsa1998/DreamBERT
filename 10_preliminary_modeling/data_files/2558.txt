I am a part of a crowd of college graduates that are taking a traditional walk out to a point on a peninsula. There are so many of us that every inch of land is covered. We are wearing caps and gowns, all black. As we walk, different speakers give eloquent speeches of tradition - history, philosophy, etc. All the knowledge as it has been, being repeated word for word as it always has. No one can speak or interrupt or change the words. We solemnly walk to the very end. Some of the people on the outside edge, I am one of them, are almost pushed off into the water, it's so crowded. We turn and walk back. Now there are long tables set up for the banquet. I walk down (on the table) to find my place. I see Michael J. Fox seated opposite. I pause, we look at each other with speaking, glances, we love each other but I am married to Howard. He's actually the graduate here; I'm a student wife. I continue on to the end of the table. Howard and I sit. Now it is time for everyone to write new knowledge, ideas, and the best one will be chosen and read for all to hear. The male announcer says, "Doyle" (the paper chase lawyer-teacher). He stands. The announcer says, "There was a tie. One more, who isn't actually a student, but a wife." He calls my name and I stand on the table, surprised, pleased and concerned that my husband will feel outdone.
