The day after Christmas. Today I had a dream that I was at school and Dad was in class with me, kind of watching me, kind of like Mom comes in sometimes. And I was in Health class, and we had this substitute that was just, she's a black woman and she was just sitting back and letting the kids run wild. And Dad got so mad about that, he was going to call the school and everything and do everything he could to get her fired. And I said to myself, "I'm never having him come into school again." And then I dreamt that the school had this like system of boardwalks and planks and exits and levels and stuff, and I wanted to get to the very tippy top. And I can't remember exactly, but I told Dad I would meet him at 2:00 o'clock, and I was like walking around these different places and things, and I came down this dive ramp thing, I like walked down it and I was in the water. Dad was right there at the bottom of it, talking to somebody, and I like waded around in the water until it was time. And then I dreamt that I was at home and involved with concert information from Mrs. Dougherty. And I was just going to take it to the monitor and read it, and then I woke up.
