The setting was something like a museum. My roommate and I attempted to rob some money. I kept a guy busy while he snuck into anther room and took some cash. Then I was to keep the guy's attention when my roommate came into the room. He noticed him, however. All my roommate did was to take a dollar's worth of change. Meanwhile the guy had given me a ten dollar bill for a one dollar bill. I was going to tell him, but forgot. When my roommate came into the room, he looked like nobody I have ever seen. After the supposed robbery I tried to feign my innocence by asking the guy what happened, etc. Then I left the room to make my escape. I went to the courtyard (and this is what made me think it was a museum) and there was a high barbed wire fence surrounding the place. I thought of the fence to be "hot." I took a piece of paper and threw it into the fence. It burned up. I walked around the fence and came to a gate where some people were waiting to get out. I stood in their midst and left as one of them. I remember I was wearing a U. of M. t-shirt.  [anxious, unpleasant, no color]
