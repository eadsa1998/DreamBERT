["Disfigured face and cheating"]  I am at some program the children are putting on. There is a series of different skits. It is finished and I am walking to a table to get some lunch. A woman teacher sits on the right. I see several empty spots and reach for a chair. Gordon is headed for the same chair and there is some confusion. I finally ask him if he is going to be sitting there. I then sit down. The woman is watching me closely. Someone says don't leave your purse on that shelf, lined up with the rest. It's an easy mark and someone will steal it. I put my purse there anyway, as I don't believe there is a danger. Now, Mary Sue and I are standing somewhere and she has a disfigured face with many scars. I am telling her not to be so embarrassed and sensitive about it. People get used to things and they don't bother them after awhile.  I tell her that people got used  to her blindness, why is this different? She insists that this is different. She remains in hiding. Now I am seated at a table with Mary Sue and Lucy. That same woman is watching us closely. Lucy has to fill out a quiz about the program we saw earlier. She can't remember the sequence of the skits and asks me to fill it out for her. I start to and then become very aware of the woman watching. I realize I am helping Lucy cheat. I stop and say no. I can't do this. This is cheating. Somewhere in this dream, I see a small golden and white kitten seated on a blanket with a pile of clothes.
