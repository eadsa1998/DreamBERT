First I dreamed that I was in Tudor England (the class), but I didn't have the right textbooks, so Mr. Bailey gave me his old ones. Then at the end of class, it was the last day of school, because I went back to my dorm room (which I shared with my brother for some reason), and then realized I needed to gather my stuff from everywhere else. So I went back to Tudor England to get my books, returned to my dorm room, and then needed to go back to get my yearbook. When I got back to the classroom, Ian was there, and he kept trying to kiss me. I think he might have if my father hadn't been there. Apparently my father and mother were taking us out to coffee to celebrate the end of the year. So he went to wait in the car. I said good-bye to Lucas and left. I ran into Willis, whom I had a long good-bye with. He told me his sister was hurt, and for the life of me, I couldn't remember her name. I kept thinking it was Amy, and not until I woke up did I remember it was Arlie. I got back to my room and my brother was packing. I had a million emails to read, but I deleted half of them. Just then, I heard a horn honking and knew it was my mother and father outside. They told us they were taking us somewhere in the city. I was reluctant to go because the next morning was the first day of the next school year. Before we left though, I had to return to elementary school to get my writing portfolio from 4th grade. After I found Mrs. Jones and got my writing portfolio, the guy who looked like Jude Law in the airport was there and said he loved my writing. The next day was proctor retreat and I had to swim in the lake with Tuck while Mrs. Carter told me being a proctor was a useless job anyway.
