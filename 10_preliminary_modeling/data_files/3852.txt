["I'm packing, eating and planning."] I am at a house, apparently my "parents" house. I am asking my "Dad" about some plans I am making about some group event. Dad is busy setting up his music festival. He has reams of paper on the subject piled up on the file cabinets. I see food on the table and dish up a full plateful of pasta and sauce. I am not hungry but I overeat and feel stuffed. I am packing my things to go back home to work on my plans.
