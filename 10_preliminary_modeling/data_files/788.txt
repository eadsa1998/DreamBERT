I'm in an old time car (like a van). I am an old woman. My "sister" and I are being taken away. I create a diversion and jump from the moving car to the road to get help. I land on my feet by a fenced cow pasture. I start hitchhiking. Someone going in the wrong direction for me sticks their nose in the air and won't turn around to help. The next person stops to help.
