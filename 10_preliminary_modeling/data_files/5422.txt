Last night I had a really weird dream. First, my college was inside some sort of mall and the gym was also a music room. When you biked or ran, the machine produced music based on how well you were exercising. So I guess I was in there with Aaron and Rick and others when the music my machine was making started sounding really bad. I was trying to find a way to fix it, but Rick, Aaron, Jasper, Mandy, and Buddy all started squirting water bottles at me, which was funny for the first few seconds, but then got annoying. I began to cry and finally escaped. I climbed up this stepladder to a room with a glass-domed ceiling so you could see all the stars. There was light, soft music, and couples dancing slowly. I saw Aaron alone, looking up at the stars. Something told me he didn't want to be disturbed. I felt sad and left.
