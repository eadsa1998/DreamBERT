I was going to have my leg cut off. The doctor came before I was dressed. He said he would talk about an artificial leg later. He was ten minutes early. Then I was with mother waiting for him to come. He was late. J. said he was to cut off two thirds of my legs. While I was waiting, I was to be initiated. They struck me on my back with a lash made of light wire. They left for a bit and a boy of 12 or 14 said, "Come with me." He led me to a large empty room and we went behind a door. I thought I had better not hide and came out. All but one were on an upper floor. Suddenly from a window, I saw a bridge sagging. Then it broke and the water was full of drowning people; but others still kept crowding on the broken bridge.
