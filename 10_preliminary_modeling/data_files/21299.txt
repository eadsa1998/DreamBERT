I was in Rivertown. It was night. I was by the carline. I thought I would fly and see who I could see. I was flying by the carline, then I came down past the alley and I stopped by Ann. I can't recall her name now. She lived there in my boyhood days. Her daughter was there and accused me of being a drunkard, but I said, "I'm not a drunkard. I just take a shot once in a while," and Ann agreed with me. She was lying on her back with her legs spread apart. I said, "Let's take a walk." So we walked into the field and it was so dark, I couldn't see a foot in front of me. I was afraid I would run into a fence, so we stopped, and here we were sitting beside a table and a woman was slicing some beef off a roast and eating it. The beef was kind of fat. We then took off. I held her in my arms and we flew thru the night. We came back and my wife Ann was with me and the other Ann was someone else. I tapped her on the rear end when my wife was not looking. Then I tapped Barbara when she did look. A colored lady went up into a white bachelor's room and she sang melodies. She sang as what she wanted the white man to do to her and when he was doing it she sang that in words also.
