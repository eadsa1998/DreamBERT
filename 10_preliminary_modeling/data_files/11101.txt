My father, some of his friends, and I were out in the woods hunting coons. The dogs got on a coon trail and ran very fast. We ran and ran trying to keep up with the dogs, but we could never catch them. Some of the men kept falling at the side of the path, too exhausted to run any more. Finally there were just daddy and me running. He fell down and I tried to help him up, but couldn't. I started to cry and cry. The end.
