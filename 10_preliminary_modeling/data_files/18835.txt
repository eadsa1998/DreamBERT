The first scene was a coastal beach. Three whale type fish swam up on the beach and remained there momentarily stranded. They then turned around and swam out to sea quickly. Next I found myself swimming endlessly in the ocean. No place was evident as my destination. Then I found myself riding the surf towards shore. It was an exhilarating feeling. I felt very pleased with its occurrence. I only came in on a wave once. The next moment I found myself "sneaking" around an island inhabited by apparently some aliens. It reminded me of James Bond on the island in Dr. No. I was with some others, but I couldn't recall who they were. [Excited, pleasant, no color] [Beach unknown](115 words)</br
