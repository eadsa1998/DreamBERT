Merle and I are in a gym kind of room. We're trying on other people's impediments. Merle has arm braces on and then a furry fake animal fur arm covering. I am to wear the furry covering on my arms. I have a hard time putting them on. They are long and floppy and I can't do much with them on. I think it would have been better if I'd put the metal braces on.
