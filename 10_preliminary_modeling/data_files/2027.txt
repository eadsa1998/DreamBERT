I am in a house next to a larger house. A woman is afraid. Some evil man might come out of the larger house and enter my house and kill me. I lock doors and feel terror. I get in bed and suddenly realize I've locked myself in with the woman (she's in bed with me), and in fact she is the evil that is trying to kill me. I run, afraid, and fight her off.
