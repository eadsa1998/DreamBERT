I was at a summer resort. As I was going down the stairs into the beach, I saw on one part of this beach, huge cockroaches. I hurriedly ran past them and safely went into the water. There were many others in the water with me, and on the shore I saw a little dark-haired boy playing in the sand. To the left of me by the water was a public beach &amp; many were swimming there in the water. Later I went into the house, where everyone was eating. A lady and her little baby were sitting with me. I noticed that there were little bugs around the table. Everyone seemed very happy.
