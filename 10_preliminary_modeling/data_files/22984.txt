I was on an upstairs floor of a department store.  Sharon Ferguson was in the vicinity.  Somehow we got the word that there was a fire in the building-downstairs, so we couldn't get out.  Everyone was told to keep as low to the floor as possible, to avoid smoke inhalation.  So everyone sat down on the floor, not seeing much smoke and expecting the sprinkler system to start at any moment.  The floor we were on was empty, like a warehouse.  When I finally left that building, I was with Henry Kissinger and a couple of other guys, whom I knew but don't remember now.  We were going somewhere with several other people, but I chose to go with this group so that I could write home and say I had ridden with Kissinger.  When I got to their car, they were already in it -- two in the front seat and two in the back -- of a Karman Ghia.  I was disappointed and said I had better ride with someone else.  They said I could squeeze in for the short ride, though, so I piled in on top of someone in what I thought was the back seat but turned out to be the front when we drove away.  I think Gaylen Tuttleson was driving.  <p
