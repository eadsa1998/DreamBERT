Once again I was at my alma mater, at my present age.  I was in a class in which the professor was asking various students at random to give examples of something.  I was lying down and hoped desperately not to be called on.  It was at the end of the class period, at 11:25.  Suddenly the door opened and students of the next class started filing in.  I thought it was very rude, because the professor was still asking students to recite, and I thought the class was not over until 11:30.  Of course it did relieve me of the anxiety of being called on, but still I made a nasty remark to one of the girls who sat down near me, about how badly students behaved nowadays.  After I left, though, I realized that the class was supposed to end at 11:20 and the new one start at 11:30.  So it was the professor who was going over.  Still, it wasn't very polite for the new class to come in.  I was then potentially a little late for my next class.  I started to go there, but couldn't find my way.  There was a new dorm complex, with overhead enclosed walkways from one dorm to another, and there was a large outdoor food court.  I had a couple of acquaintances in that class and wanted to have coffee or lunch with them after class.  Soon, however, I realized that the door would be shut when I got there and the class under way.  I wasn't prepared for the class anyway, and decided not to go, and maybe to go meet my friends when the class was over.  I realized that I was not preparing for any of my classes, and now I was beginning to cut them, and wondered if I should just go home.  I was ashamed to tell Anita I had taken this whole semester off and spent the money just for the nostalgia of being back at the university.
