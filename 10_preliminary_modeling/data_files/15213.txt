I was at University which was different. I got Dad to bring me his laptop as he was nearby. The carpark was undercover. We went to the car. There was something about a 'crush' and it had something to do with Chris Barrie photos on my computer. A guy and a girl were near me and they had bright blue eyes and were pale. They said they were vampires and they showed their fangs. I told Dad and he was like 'whatever' but eventually he looked at them and realised. We went to leave. I wondered why no-one had known of vampires before then. We drove off and saw all these people running down the street followed by heaps of creatures. There were giant dogs, ogres (like in World of Warcraft), clouds etc. Some then decided to come our way. Then we were on foot and we ran. There were creatures everywhere. We were with some others. There was a ladder on a wall which was hard to climb and this female creature was following us easily. We got to the ground and ran. There was a big meeting on the oval for the creatures. We got past them and then suddenly there were no creatures. There were some little rooms so we went in one. We shut the doors but the windows had no glass. We got talking and realized that none of us had had sex before. One of the girl's was a 'popular' girl. We wondered why that would matter. One of us asked "why is sex always a bad thing?". Then we realized all the creatures were staring in at us. We ran. Later, it was shown that a moth had flown into the room, which supposedly made us visible because it had mated before. We got caught. They impregnated us with random guys. Tara from True Blood got impregnated by Eggs (True Blood). Sookie (True Blood) was impregnated with Sam (True Blood). This other girl liked Eggs and complained. There was this thing about Sam Trammell, which was Wikipedia like. The photos of him made him look gay. It said he was gay and also used to be a teacher. I don't know if it was true though.
