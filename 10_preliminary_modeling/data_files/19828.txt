I was with my mother and sister. We moved to another house. My mother asked me if I had any friends from our old neighborhood. I said I never had any except the Braun boys. (These were 2 German boys about 9 and 10 whom I knew as a boy in [my home state]. Our friendship ended because of something I did, but I don't recall what it was.)
