I was watching Lost. They had a way of killing off characters -- they would show them and then it would fade out (with white). They killed off Ben and I was annoyed about it and told Ezra. I accidentally read that Kate died. Then Mom and I were in Venice or something. We were at a shop and at this little shop which sold jeans. I said "I don't want girls ones". This security guard guy there laughed. We didn't know how to get to the main area of Venice. There was a big body of water outside the shop. Some guy shrunk and jumped in, but it was from my point of view. He was extremely tiny and held onto a normal sized inflatable ring so he didn't sink. It took a long time to hit the water, which caused a lot of water to splash up. I was watching Dawson's Creek at one point and I realized I thought Jack was hot. I was annoyed about this and I started cutting out a picture of him to put in my presentation. I wondered whether I should update my top 10 for this month, but I didn't want James Van Der Beek to lose the top spot. Then I was watching True Blood. Some bad vampires were after Bill. Eric and some other good vampires were with him. Something had happened and they could now go out in the sun but it made them tired and like really badly sunburnt. They had been chasing them for days, walking through this rocky place. The bad vampires eventually tired and decided to sleep. The good ones coincidentally decided to do this too. Eric just 'fell' into the ground to sleep. Then somewhere else there were two graves on a hill near a house. Some girl said her boyfriend was still alive and everyone thought she was crazy/in denial but he was actually a vampire. The graves were empty underneath the top layer and then there was a wolf skin on top of some wood and then a big area for them to sleep in. I can't remember properly, but the guy wanted to get rid of the girl, I think.
