I was lecturing/yelling at my housemate/friend for her continued involvement with her ex-boyfriend. We were in the bedroom in our apartment. We were both standing and after a while she sat down. I was telling her all of the reasons I thought she should not spend so much time with her ex. She was agreeing with all of my reasons, but said she could not get out of the relationship once and for all. She did not know why, but she couldn't. I felt angry and upset during this dream. I did not like to have to tell her the things I did, but I felt like she was being 'stupid' continuing the relationship after he broke up with her and hurt her. I don't like to see her hurt, but I was upset I was the one who had to "set her strait."
