I was staying at some house which was near a huge forest with skinny trees. I went down to the beach (through the forest). Some guy had made this chart where if someone preferred 'choice A', they would always choose 'choice B'. There were pictures of females and I was picking the most attractive one out of each lot and they mostly corresponded to the chart. Anyway, I ended up walking/swimming down the beach and was near a cemetery. It was far away from the house. I was walking back and I had no signal on my phone so I couldn't call Mom to get me. I finally got back and Darren said there was ham, but they both called it something else at first and I laughed. There was a really tall building and lights from it reflected into the water to the sky and it looked pretty. I told Ezra that Mom called Supernatural stupid and said that it was the "first episode of season 2 when they had the car crash and the Reaper is trying to rape Dean and their father dies". He was like 'aw now I feel like watching it'. I was talking to Alejandro at one point and he was talking about his passport expiring and I said I applied for one and that the furthest I'd been was the other side of the country. I was thinking that I should get him to fill out the information for the witness thing. He was talking in another language.
