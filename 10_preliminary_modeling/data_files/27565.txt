I seem to have been entertaining in a beautiful large home. People were coming and going. I can't remember the details of the dream very well but I vividly remember that I was half beast and half woman. Everything my clothes did not cover was normal and therefore no one else knew the difference. However, sometime during the evening I must have taken off my dress because some of my guests looked at me in horror and left. The others seemed to accept the fact and the evening continued.
