We are on a train that isn't on tracks, but we are about to enter a tunnel where there are tracks. We have to find American Converter seat belts. We click them on and go, but there are problems. The train engineer isn't cooperating. Cindy tells me to get their phone numbers from John. I go to John, but he won't give me the numbers. He is in mutiny and we can't get home now. I remember then that I have the numbers and I'm a pack rat and don't ever throw anything out. I find the numbers and hide them. Then we are in a train station and I want to see someone who loves me, so I conjure up Darryl. I don't really see him, but I respond as if he's there. I go over to him and he says, "You don't have to sit near me." I feel hurt and rejected. Even him! Time to go buy gifts and souvenirs. I'm not happy.
