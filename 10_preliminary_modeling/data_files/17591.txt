I went to a theatre and saw some comedy thing.  I fell asleep and woke up and watched the rest while squatting in the aisle.  Then I was in my boyfriend Jeremy's backyard.  We were going to get in a hot tub.  I was to hit the button to start the jets, but couldn't find it.  I ended up crossing over into our backyard.  There was a four-inch spider coming toward, and then a 1.5 foot one.  I yelled for help.  I moved to the garage where my father was collecting dust with a tool- it told him to adjust it.  The thicker the dust, the wider the pan.  I went into the next room and accidentally walked in front of a time-lapse camera taking a picture of Jeremy.  I apologized and ended up posing with two others, but the camera never went off.  They didn't care anymore.
