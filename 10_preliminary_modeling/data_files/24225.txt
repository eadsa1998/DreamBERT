Sue, the co-worker from the college newspaper I was attracted to, was swimming with me. It was a pool party, and there were games. People jumping in, going for a ball, or something like that. I was melancholy about something, she offered advice. We were going camping next, and she helped me set up... Later, I drove to my high school sweetheart Cindy's house on mother's day. I opened the door, went inside, and prepared to be waiting there with some pastries. I chickened out. I  left, with my dog in the car. Lauren (my high school sweetheart Cindy's sister) saw me drive away. She came out. She called me. I said I was "in the neighborhood" and wanted to say "hi." She was the first to wake up. I then went to a pool area where I found we'd got a lot of multi-colored geckos, snakes and turtles. My old turtle was hungry -- but the food had all been replaced with teeny tiny little turtles. A rainbow gecko had fallen into my turtle's tank; the turtle lunged and swallowed it nearly all the way. I expected the nippy snappy to have cut the thing in half, but it didn't. It swallowed it like a snake. But the gecko wriggled free, unscathed. I took it out and set it free. But it bit me multiple times, almost drawing blood. I touched a poison dart frog. Just brushed it. I began to feel strange almost immediately. I tried to feed crickets to some of the critters, but the bag was filled with tiny turtles. My mother came home and went out into the pool area where I was slumped down near a chair or mini bar. I said I'd been bitten by a mamba or something, but had taken the correct anti-venom; I had earlier and had the healing bite mark to prove it on my right arm.
