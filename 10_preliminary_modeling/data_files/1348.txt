I am in the M City house living room but it's sort of a classroom. A teacher is writing on the board, in English. An Arab man gets up to explain it to his people He speaks in English and writes on the board in Arabic. I hear people in the audience complain because they can't read it. I laugh and point out that now the shoe is on the other foot, now we know how they felt. Later, I'm sitting on a couch. The Arabic man is talking to his young son. He calls him B. I call the boy over and ask him what his name is. He tells me. It's not mine. I say, "Oh. I thought you had the same name as me." I am holding a cat and petting it. The boy sits in a rocking chair next to me on the couch and rocks on the cat's tail. I say, "Be careful of the cat and me." He then is careful. I pull the cat out from under my skirt. A little girl comes running in and wants to be petted too. Then she is a cat and I have both of them in my lap.
