There were slow zombies. There were patches of people still alive. I was at a school place and the kids there weren't helping out. This lady called a meeting and everyone ran to this room and sat down. The door to the room was saloon like (it was a kitchen) and it didn't close. The zombies got in and I was near the door. I told everyone to be still and the zombies just walked past, looked around and kept walking. When some of them passed, everyone scattered. A few others and I sat at some desks. The zombies just walked past again. Later, only a few of us were left. Analisa was there and I asked her about the stopover times for America and the UK. She said it was as few days for America and 15 days for the UK. Then I was in an area that had something to do with science. The rooms were full of medicine and stuff. We looked outside and lots of zombies were coming (we were like the last ones left). We went into this freezer to hide. Then it was a game. Ezra and I had this thing out the back of the old house. It was sort of like a vertical bullet and was like a TARDIS inside. It also had this tight spot with a pee box and a big toilet. People would come sometimes to trade stuff or they would just steal. We discovered a way to beam up to space. There was a call from some official people, including Poppa.
