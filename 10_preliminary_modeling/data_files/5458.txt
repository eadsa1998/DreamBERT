I had such a vivid dream about graduation in May. First I think I was in the gym doing sit-ups and Keegan came in. I saw him in the mirror and my heart fluttered. I kept doing sit-ups and all of a sudden I was at the off-campus boys lacrosse team's house with Kit. We were dancing and kissing and it was fun. Then it was senior week (the week of festivities leading up to graduation) and I was running to the library in a blue dress. I think all the seniors had to gather there. I burst through the doors in the library and realized I was drunk. It was a strange feeling, because I think what I had been nervous about before was being late, not drunk. Kit was there wearing a pink and white striped haberdashery shirt and he hugged me and bemoaned the fact that we had never dated at college. He said he wanted to see me next week after we graduated, but I didn't want to for some reason. The inside of the library was constructed in a sort of Frank Lloyd Wright-esque way, in that there were all these steel rafters and open staircase shafts. The building was minimalist and modern and blended in with the environment so perfectly that the ocean waves were swelling up and crashing into the library walls. All of a sudden, I guess the entire setting changed and we were on Pandora, the planet in Avatar. There was a huge wave swelling up about to crash over, and I had to run all the way up to the top of the wave before it crested. I think I did, but then all of a sudden I'm right back in the middle of senior week. Alondra is doing stand-up comedy, but no one is laughing. I am waiting to hear the punch line to this piece she is doing, but I can feel myself waking up. I fight consciousness so hard until I hear the punch line, which was, "The musical, Les Miserables." It makes no sense to me now, but apparently it was hilarious and fitting in the dream.
