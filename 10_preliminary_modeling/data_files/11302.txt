I was going to play tennis. Somehow I heard that some Mexican bandits were in the vicinity and had captured a man. I went to my uncle (49) to borrow his guns. He told me they were in the car. I went to the car and got them. I walked out and saw my uncle in his car with his wife; he was petting her. Another uncle (39) (he lives in Calif.) was parked in front and he pulled away, rode down the road and turned the corner. My aunt (28) remarked that he was going too fast. My uncle said he wasn't.
