I dreamed that my mother had died and my entire family was gathered in our living room after the funeral. We were all upset and everyone was very unhappy, and some of the family were crying. I was very unhappy, but was not crying , and I was talking to no one. I looked across the room and saw one of my sisters crying and very upset. I walked over to her and in front of everyone announced to her that I could see no reason why she was crying and acting as though she was upset. I told her that she of all people should never cry at my mother's death since she had done nothing while my mother was alive to make her anything but miserable and unhappy. At that point I was in the center of comments from the entire family, and I began to cry. My roommate then awakened me because I was sobbing in my sleep. All the people in my dream were members of my family. My sister is 39 years old.
