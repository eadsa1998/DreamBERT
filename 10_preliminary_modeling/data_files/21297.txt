I took a couple of doughnuts and walked towards school in Rivertown. I gave one to a boy there and it turned out to be a pair of trousers that I was discarding. He took them and looked them over. He as a rule would clean and mend them, then sell them. I was early to school so I was walking back home. I had other dreams that I can't recall now. I was in a field with a friend of mine and we had an idea there were bulls there, so we took off and were flying. He was afraid of how he would stop, so I stopped and came down to show him how easy it was done.
