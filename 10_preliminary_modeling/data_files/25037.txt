 I'm with my dad in a car he is driving. We turn from Friends Avenue in Wilmerton onto Main Street going west. There is a police car across from us. My dad went through a red light. The police car lights come on. My dad pulls over, then drives farther, and finally pulls over by Farm Store. The police officer is female. She asks my dad for license and registration. I open the glove compartment. It is cluttered with five or six ice scrapers, lots of little notebooks, and a bag of small oval insurance cars, less than a couple inches long. The cards are gold colored and have names written on them. <br/
