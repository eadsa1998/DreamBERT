There was a captive. He was tall, so there was a bayonet point put against his heart and was pushed in slowly. The man made a painful expression. I thought the point was going to hit his heart, but it was pulled out and a lot of stab wounds were made in the shoulder and at last the victim held up his hand and surrendered. The stabbing was stopped and he talked. I was walking in White's. I went in the office and talked with the secretary and the executives. We went out for lunch and it was night out. We came out to a traffic light and it was red, but there were small cars, about four of them, went through the red light. They had a lot of lights on. Mother and I were in bed. I got up and I said, "What is this?" My neckties were on the bed. I complained and the door slammed by itself. It frightened Ann. I was intoning to make the evil spirit go away. We were standing on a bridge and watching the dirty water floating by. There were boys wading and poking sticks into the water. I was told they were looking for a seven-year-old boy who fell and drowned himself. I saw Charley Porhaska on the bridge. I was driving my small car thru a different town. I found a restaurant and then I found a treasure in it. Someone said Fisher won and will win again.
