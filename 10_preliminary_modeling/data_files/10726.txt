I had a part in a play, but put off learning the lines. I kept thinking about the part and kept putting it out of my mind. Finally I was backstage, surrounded by black velvet curtains. I couldn't find the opening in the curtains to get to the stage, and I was also panicky because I had not learned my part. Just at the moment when I was supposed to go onstage, my older sister went on instead and took my part.
