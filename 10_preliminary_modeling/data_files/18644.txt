We were meeting to go on a camping trip. It was 11:14 at night. Evelyn was asleep when I called her and woke her up but I told her she could go back to sleep once we got going and sleep till we got there. It was the mountains and my father had made sandwiches for the trip. Peanut butter and jelly or peanut butter and cheese. I peeled the American cheese off, for it to be plain peanut butter. These were cut in triangle halves. PBJ's were cut in rectangular halves. WE sat in the boat at night rocking in the water. Then I was in a walk up that came out in an alley like down on Mercer Street long ago. I was with a tour group. They started singing the Mr. Rogers song, but I was the only one who knew all the words. I spotted a wad of cash and I put my foot on it to keep the wind from blowing it away. Next to it was a black plastic bag--thick plastic. It was a bag of loose money. 1's, 5's, 10's. I picked up the bag and joined back in to the Mr. Rogers song. We went back up to the hotel apartment and I had already made a mess. Clothes were everywhere. On the bed post were 2 long old old cut-up t-shirts that had belonged to a very old couple, very much in love, who had to leave quickly. They were long t-shirts faded white, thick cotton with the sleeves cut out. The man's had a neckerchief of faded navy blue, same material as t-shirt and I took them from the bed post. By now the money in the bag had turned into granola bars and peanut brittle. Grandma punched holes in a can of milk to mix with coffee.
