I was taking a shower. The shower curtain closed in on me. I was struggling to push it away so it wasn't touching me, so I had room to take a shower. It had formed a complete circle, as though it were on a circular rod. I was at home in my own shower, but there were women standing outside the shower, at least two of them were Sisters from OLGM. It might have been Sister Betty and Sister Toni. One of them showed me a different setting on the massage head that I had not known about.
