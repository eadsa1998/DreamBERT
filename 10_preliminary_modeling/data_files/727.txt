I was at cousin Patricia and husband Morton's house. They were showing me around the kitchen. It was huge. I remember a huge, carpeted room and a grand piano in the corner. Most luxurious. I thought, "How totally rich to have a grand piano in the dining room." I looked and a dining room table, most fancy, appeared as I felt it should be there. I went into another room, large, spacious, with rich red tones. I asked to see Morton's "sound room." I exclaimed at the cork on the walls, to sound proof the room. It was off-red tones. Traveled on to a "green house" room with high ceilings. Cut flowers, white, green, yellow, were up high on a ledge by a small sun light window on the ceiling. Vases, etc. were around the room. The house continued forever. I then tried to drive around. I knew myself to be in an old home town but couldn't remember the way; I kept passing the turn-offs. Driving, I said to myself, "Oh, you missed the turn off. You're headed toward A City." Pete was in the dream and so was Aunt Elaine.
