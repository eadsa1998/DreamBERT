Placido Domingo was at the front door trying to squeeze through. He had flowers in his hands. I couldn't shut the door. He followed me up to the playroom and I tried closing the door before he could come in. His face and hands were through; he was still holding the flowers. I wanted to take a shower, but a whole bunch of boys were trying to come in too. They were 8-10 years old. Everyone kept following me. At my parents' house. The playroom is where my little sister would sleep.
