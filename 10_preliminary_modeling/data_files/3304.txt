I am with Ginny and Ernie. Ernie gives me sweet glances of love. I am unsettled. It feels wonderful and I feel terrible because it isn't right. I try to avoid him. He follows me around and then finally says, "I want to kiss you." I walk away. Then he comes up behind me and hugs me gently and with love. I want to relax into it, but walk away. Ginny comes in and I don't know how to act. Ernie says truthfully and directly, "I kissed B." Ginny bursts into tears and walks away angrily. I follow her saying it won't happen again. She says angrily, "You can have him." I say, "No, he's yours." We do this back and forth.
