I was working for CAS. I was out on the road but don't know if I was calling on prospective clients, clients, or preparing to do training. I was in a parking lot and getting ready to pull through a double row so I could pull back out easily. As I was preparing to pull into a space I saw that there were a lot of children walking around, getting ready to get on a school bus or some similar vehicle. I waited for them to get on the vehicle so I wouldn't risk their safety. As I put my car in park I was thinking that I needed either a map or atlas. I don't remember which one I pulled. I wanted to look up directions to where ever it was that I was headed. Someone that I was talking to thought I was in Elmwood or coming from Elmwood. I didn't get a chance to correct them and let them know that was not right. It seems to have something to do with University technology management offices.
