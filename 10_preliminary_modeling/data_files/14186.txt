I was watching Forgetting Sarah Marshall. Jason Segel was talking to his uncle and his mother. This girl came along and his uncle went and put these two curvy balls together (which was some sexual joke). There was a laugh track and Jason Segel was looking at his mother and trying not to laugh. I was like 'what the hell is this? This isn't funny'. Later his uncle said to him that he ate "shit for you!" and then "literally. I had my legs around his waist...". I remembered something earlier with Paul Rudd jumping off a cliff.
