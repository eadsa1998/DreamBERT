["Talking Conrad out of sexual abuse."] I am on a journey down a road. I am driving something. Although I don't actually see or experience a vehicle. It's like it is invisible. I round a curve and see a large body of water on the right, like a bay. The water is also over the road by a few inches. I say Oh, Oh. And slow down, negotiating the water on the road successfully. Then the road curves and I am looking for the next turn off on the left. A female narrator is helping me. I ask her if that next one is the one and she says no, keep going. Then she yells, That one! I turn left and she warns me it will be very steep. I see that it is and continue. Then I am climbing hand over hand as the road is so steep it is turned sideways and is straight up and down. I am afraid I will lose my grip and fall. Finally I am over the dangerous part and continue on. Now I am at a cabin, inside. Conrad and a male friend of his is there. Someone mentions a 13 year old girl is there. Conrad is interested and asks me if I think its OK for him to be sexual with her. I am shocked and explain to him that is sexual abuse. He thinks it will just be fun and sexually stimulating. I tell him that a young girl's mind and self can be injured by his being sexual with her. She hasn't matured enough to make good decisions. He is disappointed and thinks I'm a bit of a prude.
