I am teaching the 3rd grade. I am in front of the class, setting up the blackboard and the audio visual aids and the wall decorations. I wrote the word "spelling" on the blackboard. One smart alec boy says she probably can't spell it. I write the word juxtaposition, thinking it would be a tough one for the smarty boy to manage. I set up the Halloween decorations on the windows. A clump of hay with tape across it to look like a hay stack with a fence. I seem to have started late. I am trying to get caught up.
