 There is a zoo with a large enclosed area for the monkeys and chimpanzees. A high concrete wall surrounds the area. The wall slants in places, and there is another wall or ledge next to it, which is not as tall. The monkeys can escape if they can figure out to jump from the ledge onto the lowest part of the slanting wall. A monkey walks along this ledge, close to the larger wall. It seems I am the monkey. I jump up onto the concrete wall and get out of the pen. I am a zookeeper and must catch the monkey that has escaped. I talk to two men, and say that I want big paws/feet so I'm able to hop, like a kangaroo, around and catch the big monkey that has escaped.
