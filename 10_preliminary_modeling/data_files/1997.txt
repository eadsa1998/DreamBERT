Bon Jori, a rock group, is playing on stage. I'm in the wings and want to rehearse with them. They do some contact improv and won't let me enter. So I go out to the audience. I'm angry and think, "OK! You just wait and see. You'll regret that." I talked to the women and then one by one and told them how they wouldn't let me join them. We all agreed to get up and walk out during their performance. We do. I step out the door and open it back up to let other women through. I hear them stop playing, in confusion calling out, "Hey lady, where are you going? What's going on?" Some men in the audience wanted me to tell them what's going on, but I chose to only talk to the women. I feel revenge. I see the audience only half full and smile.
