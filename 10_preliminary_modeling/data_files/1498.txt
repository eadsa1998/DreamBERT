Cary Grant is in a bar and he is quite drunk. (I spell his first name Gary.) A good looking, middle-aged man attempts to seduce him. Cary warms to him at first until he realizes this is a homosexual encounter. Cary feels saddened and apologetic because he likes the guy, but can't involve himself sexually. Cary tries to escape by sneaking out of the bar. He goes next door to a restaurant. The gay man follows him. Cary sneaks through the back door only to find himself in the bar again. He opens another door and sees that it leads downstairs. He hears a dance band. He decides that's no good, he finds another door. It opens into a closet. He again goes out the front door and discovers that it is very stormy and windy outside. He looks up the street and sees a Santa Claus wagon driving by. It comes to where he is. He looks in and sees a woman semi-naked in the front seat. He asks her if he can have a ride. She helps him in. The next scene, they are at her apartment. They like each other. However, Cary has a problem. He's sick from so much drinking. He goes into the kitchen and starts throwing up. She groans and tells him to at least try for the garbage can. He tries. Now she's starting to clean up the mess on the floor, muttering to herself, "Why am I doing this!" She decides she's doing it because she likes him.
