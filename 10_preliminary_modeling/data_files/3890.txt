["Showering with the girls."] I see my dream mother who is very tired. She has been working very hard. I say come on into my room and lie down and rest. She does. I walk with her and after she is lying down, I decide to change my clothes. I go to the closet and see lots of hangers laying down in a row blocking my way to the clothes. I manage to reach through and get a dress, my purple sleeveless jumper. I am looking for a blouse too. I realize most of these clothes I'd gotten at Good will and didn't recognize them Most are too small for me to fit into. I am interrupted and I decide to walk across the long hall and change in the other bedroom, the one belonging to other siblings. I decide I need a shower and take my clothes off. I notice that along one wall of this outer bedroom are shower heads or sprinklers and water is pouring down the wall. It does not occur to me that that is the shower. Instead, I open a metal door and step in to a very long and narrow metal shower stall, where three or four other women, in colorful bikini's are already in there. I am surprised and a bit embarrassed by my nakedness. One woman says to me this is a class. Oh, I say. The shower water turns on and I get my hair wet. Just as I hear a click that I suspect will be the shut off of the water, I suddenly decide to shampoo my hair and sure enough with my hair all lathered up, the water stops. The other women are not sympathetic.
