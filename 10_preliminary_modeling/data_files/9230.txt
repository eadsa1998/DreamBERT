It was a Monday in late December or early January. Very cold and dark outside with either a heavy frost or light snow. Matthew and someone else was at my house. Matthew took my trash and recycling out without my asking, which he never does. After he closed the door behind him, I made a comment about this to the other person there. As they were getting ready to leave I told Matthew that was going to take down my Christmas decorations that evening. He chuckled and asked me if I was going to climb up onto the roof. I had forgotten that he had hung lights around the edge of the roof. I told him that I had forgotten about them and asked if he could come back tomorrow to take those down. I had really hoped to have all the decorations down that evening. He said he would come back tomorrow. As they were leaving I started pulling lights off of a bush by the door. They were still turned on, but as I started pulling them off of the bush they went off. I didn't look for the end and take them off in order the way we had put them on. Instead, I just grabbed the strand and started pulling. When they went off Matthew thought they were broken. I didn't think so. I told him that they probably just came unplugged when I pulled on them. This wasn't like my waking home. The front door faced the side yard rather than the street. The bush was to my left as I stood facing outside. It was taller than it was wide.
