 I'm voting in an election. My friend Queen Billman is there. We are in the church across the street from Brimson, where we vote. The man at the voting place has a form I need to complete before I can vote. I don't understand part of it, he says. The task is for me to explain two phrases or gestures involving both hands. I have to explain what each hand is doing. In one example one hand is on top of the other, but also below it. I don't grasp the concept fully.
