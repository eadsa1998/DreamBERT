I was with family and I realized I had missed all of my 4.28.01 appointments. I looked in my appointment book to see who I would have to call and how many would need to be rescheduled. I was at a meeting. It was a large room, like a conference room, with many tables. I gathered my things along with a cup of water and tried to find a seat near the middle of the room. The speaker kept moving around and I thought I would be able to hear better there. The people didn't want me there and made that very clear. I picked up my cup of ice water and papers and moved again.
