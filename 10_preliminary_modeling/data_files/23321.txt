Among a series of vaguely remembered incidents stands out a visit to a dirty attic room containing a recently vacated bed which was teeming with insect life -- black ants with white larvae, and many other species. Concerning one kind, I asked my brother if they were "pediculi" (lice)-- nd he said they were. As we went out, I saw a black, greasy sausage-like thing crawling upon a shelf. "What is that?" I asked. "A lion bug," was the answer.
