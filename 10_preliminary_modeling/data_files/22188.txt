I was in one of the streets of downtown Lima and I had to take a bus, but since it didn't stop, I did it by just hanging on to the front door. I was unlucky enough to slip and the back wheels ran over both of my legs. When I saw this, I let go of the door and hung on to the wheel and I was, somehow, grasping the whole wheel and only my head was to one side. The bus kept going and I kept going around with the wheel, but nothing happened to me and I felt an agreeable sensation because I saw that the wheels going over my whole body, except my head, didn't harm me at all and I didn't let go until a while later.
