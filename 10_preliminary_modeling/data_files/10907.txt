I dreamed that I was in the Adelbert yard, getting a drink out of a fountain. A parade or large group of students came by and among them I saw the boy (21) whom I used to go with. I was about to go over to speak to him when I saw the girl whom he now sees instead of me. I felt very sad, lonely, rejected, and I started to sing to myself f, "O where, o where has my highland laddie gone."
