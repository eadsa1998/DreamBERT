 I'm eating dinner at my friend Annie Thomas' house. We kneel on small kneelers. I say that my dad used to make something like these, (which he did). Annie kisses me several different times before and around dinnertime. I realize we are not together when she is doing this. Her father, Dr. Bill Thomas, comes in. He asks me if that is my truck parked outside their house. I take a look. I say no, it's not mine: mine is newer and has less rust. He has socks on his arms, like I use to catch chickens. We all leave for a play. We're running a little late. I forget my shoes. Annie's sister Jessica comes and unlocks the door for me. The door is the front door on my house. I was standing on the porch when I realized I forgot them. I have a key, but Jessica got her key out quicker.
