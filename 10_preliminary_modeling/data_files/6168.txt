I had a dream that I was at home in the living room watching TV. I heard a noise in the hallway so I slowly opened the door to see if there was anyone there. (There wasn't.) I did this a few times and finally the last time I opened the door slowly again and waited to see if there was anyone around. After a few moments a shadow gradually appeared and then a man. I got really scared, but I couldn't scream in the dream. He was getting closer and closer to me. And I remember thinking I wanted the dream to end because I was so scared. I did wake up. The dream never continued.
