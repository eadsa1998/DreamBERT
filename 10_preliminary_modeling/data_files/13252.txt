We were messing around with water. We made this whirlpool thing and also this big puddle and we took a photo of it. Ezra was there. Then we were somewhere else. We made a big pool size whirlpool thing and the whirlpool took longer to disappear. Every time someone swam in it, they were sucked to the middle. Mr Haynes let me have my phone. Ezra took it and I said "Don't open it!" because I had that morphed picture of Eugene on there. Samantha went for a swim. I left, but when I came back she didn't answer me and I was thinking 'she better not be dead'. She was. She was floating upside down. I got her out and she had this mask thing on and I couldn't get it off. I blew into this phone, which blew through a hole into her mouth and was doing CPR. She started breathing but didn't wake up. I was thinking of the '101...' books and that I'd now saved a life. I was telling Mom later in the car and she was laughing. There were Indians and they were doing some Christmas thing and Christmas was on December 20th. Days later, I was on MySpace and there were all these RIP things on Samantha's MySpace. There were photos of Selena. Then it was Tiana who had died. Kaia and Classmate-F-02 had commented and there was stuff about Audrey Tautou and Ms Solomon. Samantha had a post that said that Elijah liked to be Elizabeth for The Crucible play. She asked how many kids he gave himself.
