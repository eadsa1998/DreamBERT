I'm on stage with "The Birds." My voice is back. At first I'm in the audience pretending to play a piano on the table while my father played a real piano on stage. Then I got up on stage and sang and acted, ending with a fake, but pretty good attempt to play the piano. My father and I went together, holding hands to take a bow.
