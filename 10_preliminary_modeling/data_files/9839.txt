Father Andrew has a birthday: he receives many flowers. We all sit downstairs and he reads cards he received; he invites me to sit downstairs with Marissa. He kisses her as they walk downstairs and then they sit on the same chair; close together; he lets me read his cards; smiles warmly; earlier: he telephones some instructions, so as to be first in a good fight.
