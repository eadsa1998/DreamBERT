I was at the old house alone. Something weird was going on. I saw a police car with two young guys cheering and going like "Woo!" and they pulled up at the house across the road. I closed and locked the door. I went to my room and heard a noise. They were at the front door trying to get in. One had only light blue jeans on. One looked like Ron Mael and the other looked like Russell Mael. The one that looked like Russell went to the back and tried to get in through the back door. I sent him back out. Later he was back out the back and said "I hope you know what happens at the end". I locked everything up. Then Ron came out of the toilet. I put my arms between his legs and carried him out on my back. I text Mom to say that people were trying to break in and I needed help. Then Russell was Kenny Hotz. His mother was young and really Jewish/Bronx-y sounding. He said he was on an 'island' and she misinterpreted as an actual island and said "I don't care if you fly, jump from a plane or swim". I can't remember properly but some bad guys captured me and some others. We were now actually on an island [possibly from having watched Shutter Island yesterday]. We escaped and were trying to get off the island. We were in the water and had a cannon. They tried to aim for the bomb, but missed. Then I was Rick from The Walking Dead comic and his wife was still around. She was floating? It turned out this alcohol was actually poison and everyone had drank some, but she died. Kat had moved a toilet so it would fall outside and did something to a door and this was how, presumably, they had poisoned the drink. Chuck (Gossip Girl) and his girlfriend and a guy were having a threesome. The guy kissed Chuck, and I thought it was hot.
