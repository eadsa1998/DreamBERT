Rosemary called. She sounded blue. She and I both dreamt about each other and Elliot. My dream had lots of "things" cluttering it, sneakers, blue with brass. Orson written on sneakers, size 11. It looked like Nate's shoe. Dovre and I were packing to go to Alaska. We got there. Rosemary was crying, said she was pregnant and by Elliot. We felt miserable.
