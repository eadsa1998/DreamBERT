I went into Ezra's room and he was watching season 2 of Red Dwarf. I remembered how skinny Rimmer was compared to season 7 and 8 and was thinking he was really hot. I was going through stuff on my computer later and I was in the TV shows folder and I had to scroll through everything and it was cloudy and taking ages. Ezra had downloaded the latest Heroes episode and asked me what happened to Claire in the shop and I had no idea what he was talking about and he gave the episode to me. Claire and Peter were in a flashback. I was with someone sitting on a dodgy ledge thing on the beach and we were scabbing money off people somehow. Sometimes I was with Dad. Ezra and I were playing this virtual reality type game and I was a hologram. We were trying to escape and he died. I was fighting and trying to steer this huge boat. I was having trouble controlling it and then I had to fight this guy and I was having trouble with him, so I grabbed my lightbee and was fading away, so as he punched me, he fell off the boat.
