I am in a bus and discover I haven't my blue bag. I pull cord to stop bus. It stops in a tunnel under a bridge where it should turn around. Very muddy and a building is under construction. I try two routes but can't find the way out. Return to bus and ask the way. I know they are on Wilder but how far up and how to get to the street? He indicates an arriving postman at far right where it's lighter. I see way to street but the blue bag is still missing and I can't make them understand where I want to go.
