In this dream I am Donald Duck. Me and Daisy, Hughey, Duey, &amp; Luey, and Grandma Duck are sitting at home. We are telephoned by a radio quiz show. Grandma Duck is asked some question about who she is or what she's wearing, to which she replies, "I'm a lampshade," because she's wearing a gauzy blue lampshade on her head as some kind of hat, or to fix it or something. The DJ says she's wrong and won't get a prize, and hangs up. Grandma Duck is insulted, and we all go to the radio station to argue with the DJ. We are wandering around the station, looking for the DJ and the main studio. It is a very plush place. Somebody gives me directions, but the place keeps getting plusher and plusher. Everybody in the office is sitting around at bars drinking or at tables eating very good meals and snacks. Like a continual and very expensive party. I have become myself imperceptibly by now. At one table I find Norman Guttman, my advisor.... I also sort of treat him as I would Paul Ober. He doesn't want to talk then, but I keep asking him about something or other, probably directions for the studio. I tell him I must ask one more thing and he says, "What, you want to ask for my check." I am a little surprised that they pay for the meals and drinks. There is some action after this, which I have forgotten. There was a lot of dreaming after this I don't recall. It was divided into sections by recurrent trips up to some sort of outdoor bargain shop up on Skyline Blvd., a place like Sammy K's. I was always trying to get there or meet somebody there. Also one scattered fragment of looking down some stout girl's dress and seeing her breasts and nipples -- I guess she didn't have a bra on.
