I was helping two little girls with arithmetic but instead tried positive and negative numbers thru temperatures. After easier problems, I asked what the temperature would be if from -20 it grew 30 degrees colder. Judy answered, "add them." Then time for lunch. "We have some of that rice dish you fixed left." That was so long ago, we had better heat it, put some butter in the pan and put the rice in." Then some woman brought a rice pudding, I thought, "so much rice."
