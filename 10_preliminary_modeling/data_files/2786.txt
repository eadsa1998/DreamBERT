I look up and the baby girl has gone off to talk to some people. I feel tired, but it is my duty to teach her the more disciplined way of not barging in other people's conversations. I go get her and bring her back. She is not happy about that. Soon I see that she has gone again and I get up and retrieve her again. I feel tired, but know this is the only way to assist her to get along better with others. Later, we are in our apartment. I am in a dining area and a big living room adjoins it. There is also a bedroom space where my bed is and another open space where her bed is. I walk into the bedroom area and see it's really a barn. There is a layer of hay on the floor and the whole end wall is missing and open to the outdoors. I am surprised and repeat to myself, "I live in a barn." I go back to the dining area and then feel danger. I know the elevator is going to crash through the ceiling. At first I think it is the girl that lives above us dancing too much or something. I look up and see a square and then it opens up and an open elevator crashes through with two people on it, one a boy and the other a huge fat woman. It smashes the couch and I am relieved to know I or the little girl wasn't sitting there or we'd have been smashed. [BL]
