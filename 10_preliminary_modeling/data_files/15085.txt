I got my own house which was small, but had a big yard -- it was just a big square area fenced in. There wasn't much grass, but lots of dark sand. We went to this shop with traffic lights. You had to get one item at a time, so I went through and people were moving so slowly and I rang a guy to complain and got a pack of something. I went home and went back later and it was heaps faster. Mom came over and she was like 'the yard would be good for Rover'. Ezra drove a tractor thing. The sand was poison and I wasn't able to get rid of it.
