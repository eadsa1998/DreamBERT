There was a cat, who was Widget but wasn't, and it shot itself. It had two legs. Then I was in this place and there was no-one there, except for a few people. Everyone had been put into these categories. All of the categories were full. It was spooky, and I went to this shop and Jake Gyllenhaal was there. He was angry, but I wanted to get his autograph.
