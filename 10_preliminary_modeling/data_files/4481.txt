["Naked everyone."] Jake comes into my house, only it's not my house. I don't recognize it. He is naked and lies on the floor. I sit up in bed. I then see Charla has taken off her clothes and is naked. Another woman walks around naked. I am concerned. I tell Charla she has to put her clothes on. I whisper to Jake, embarrassed to tell him, that it's not OK for him to be naked out in public where other people are. He says why. And just continues lying there. Charla gets up on the bed with me and has her clothes on now. We laugh and hug. Now I look at Jake, curious what his penis looks like. It's sort of small. I quickly look away, embarrassed by my curiosity. Now Jake gets up and walks into the next room to watch football on TV. I don't know what to do to make him get dressed. A man comes to the door. He says he hurt himself picking up my wheelchair. He wriggles his back like its injured. I am annoyed with him for over acting his injury. I didn't ask him to pick it up. It wasn't my fault.
