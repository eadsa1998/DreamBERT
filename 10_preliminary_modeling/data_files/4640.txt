I am at school, entering a class room. A young man is setting up a tall rectangular clear plastic box. Several musicians are setting up to play music. The man asks me sympathetic questions about when did I play music myself and too bad I can't do that anymore. I tell him about my Rheumatoid Arthritis and how my fingers were deformed and I had to give up playing instruments. I tell the story nostalgically and he is empathetic. Later, he and I are going to sing a song together. We'd worked on a bit. A sort of impromptu moment. We begin to sing and falter as we both forget the words. We look at each other for guidance on the next word. Finally we stop and sit down. I say to the small group of people listening "He forgot the words." Nobody seems upset or cares. I even feel relaxed about it.
