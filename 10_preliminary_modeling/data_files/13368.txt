It was Wednesday and I got to school and I didn't have my school clothes on. I went to the toilet to change. These two ladies were standing outside the toilet. They said someone had been putting students up something that killed them and they suspected me. I was like "huh?". After I changed clothes I walked home. Ezra was there. Mom and Poppa came over. Poppa was talking about a choice of a car or $200k and something else.
