We were in the house and were told when we go into the basement there's all these big monsters and I went down with my friends and we all got really scared because there was a purple scaly komodo dragon. So I started to attack it and if he touched me I would get poisoned and die, so I fought him and he was about to strike at me when I put out my fingers and I thought just stop, and I said, "be nice dragon-there's no reason to fight" and all my friends were fainted because they were scared and I got to keep the komodo dragon and the komodo dragon said to me that there are no more monsters in the basement. So we put our stuff down there.
