Don from the Get Real Challenge on Oprah was at my house. I had the impression that we were just friends but that he was interested in more than that. We were sitting in the kitchen of my birth home. He was having, maybe ill or some kind of medical problem. We went to the bathroom several times. The last time he came out he looked like he was going to fate. He leaned up against the wall, the corner, and was holding on to doorknobs. His face just got blood red, deep dark red. Blood started pouring out of his face. Primarily out of the area of his right eye but it practically covered his whole face. I didn't know what to do. I grabbed some tissue to hold onto to blot up the blood while I called 911. When I called 911. at first I was having difficulty dialing it. I kept dialing the wrong numbers because it was kind of dark and I couldn't see the numbers. Finally got the number and told them who it was and they said, Oh no, not him again. They finally did come and took him out.
