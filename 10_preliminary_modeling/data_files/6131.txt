I was in a shopping market with roller skates on my feet but I kept falling. I am usually a great roller skater. My boyfriend's brother and friends were there. I was trying to roller skate around them, but I couldn't stay on my feet. So I took off my skates and went into the bathroom. I kept falling in the women's room. But I also had no clothes on the bottom half of me. I had a shirt on, but nothing on the bottom. My shirt did cover to my knees. When I walked out of the bathroom, I just walked around the store shopping as usual. My friends were shopping then.
