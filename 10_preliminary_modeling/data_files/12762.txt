I was at Mom's and some dude sent us some money and something else. He was promoting a school that he created. I told him that I'd tell everyone about it and that it would do well. After two weeks he came back and complained. I said that you had to wait longer. Mr Reilly was saying something about the end of the year and that he looked forward to $7200. There were rides at this place and Charlene was there. Then I was at this place. The staff were all robots and robots had taken over everything. I was watching this movie where this guy went into this rocket before it exploded and he was trying to push the bomb and himself out. Mom and I were in a car. It was controlled my robots. They were putting the windows down and unlocking the doors. We decided to crash the car, so Mom went through a red light but we only got a little bit smashed and were upside down.
