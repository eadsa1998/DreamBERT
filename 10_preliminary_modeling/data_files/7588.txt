I was looking at china with you (the interviewer, a woman)., I don't know where we were. You bought this big silver water pitcher. It was a beautiful thing. The base of it was in little depressions; it was about _ inch high up, in layers, three of them. Then it went in a little. The bottom of the pitcher itself was big, the middle more narrow, and the top fluted way out. The handle was full, it was a big handle and the inside was scalloped (the part that you slip your hand through). You bought that. It was a beautiful thing, just gorgeous. I was looking at china. There was a nice plate set that I wanted. The cups were full, but delicate, and had scalloped handles. All around the plate had designs on the outer rim (raised designs). I wanted it very badly but I just couldn't bring myself to buy it. I thought it was just too high. I just couldn't afford it.
