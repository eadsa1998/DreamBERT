I was at a hospital. Simon and River (Firefly) were there. There was a black girl in a coma, there was a spike on the machine which was caused by a strong feeling - in this case, love. We realised it was because of her brother and we told her "don't touch your brother or your father". Simon was in another room and made up this thing for River to drink and it was twice the normal dose. He gave it to me and I went to find River. Then I was with this girl who could teleport. We went to a hotel lobby. I asked this lady if Boyd was staying there and someone said "what about Lynn?" and someone had a message. I told them that they were about to go out because the bad guys were coming. We saw them and teleported away. Then there were cops (or FBI) in an alley but they were dodgy. Then I was on an excursion somewhere far away. People started getting weird after a few days. The guy in charge said he didn't know the way to get back. A guy kept trying to attack me. I called Mom and asked her to pick us up -- there were 511 people. She asked how much it was going to cost. It had also cost $80 for the excursion. She said she would do it and I was thinking that I'd just take my friends and leave the rest of the people here.
