 I'm in the Big Resort Area. I go into my room. It is big, I think very big for two people. I realize more than two people are living here. There is a toilet on the ground floor in the open. The room has a loft, where I think four people will live. I meet my roommates. One is named Matt. He is a larger man in his mid twenties. My friends Niles and Tim Zelling are my roommates too. I meet some of the other employees. They are older than I, and larger. Mike looks different than I pictured: taller and scruffier. There is a lake nearby. One guy starts up a boat with a motor and makes a small circle before docking again. Someone seems to control the boat from shore. The controller seems to have a mini boat next to the shore, which goes in a small circle next to shore, and also controls the movement of the larger boat. They want me to start the motorboat. The boat is like an alpine sliding cart, made of plastic. I try to start it. There is long rope connecting the sled and I with the boat. I sink in the plastic "boat". I get help from people that live there. There is a heavy crosswind, like being on a river. I can't grip the handle, which is like the stock of a gun. Then I grip it well and the engine starts. I'm in the plastic sled and I can't make the boat move. There are loons and a bald eagle there. There is a group of canoeists on a trip singing and playing guitar. The mosquitoes and the slugs are really bad. I am wearing a yellow rain suit when I go to start the boat. I walk in the water and don't get wet except through the collar. A man I work with is carrying a girl out of the water. I am taking the rope out. The man gets pushed under the water a bit.
