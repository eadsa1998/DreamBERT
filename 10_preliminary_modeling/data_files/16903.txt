I'm taking part in a music course. The tutor is Nick Cave. Many of the other students are somewhat in awe of him because he is famous etc. I'm just a little wary of him. His course is interesting an unusual. It combines, history, theory and practice and centres around composition and writing. He gives us a reading list which contains mostly things I've never heard of - many of them classical. He takes us out of the college into a wood where we listen to the sounds of nature. He is very serious and most people don't dare to speak to him. One guy is keen to speak to him but doesn't dare, and asks me if it would be ok to call him on the telephone.
