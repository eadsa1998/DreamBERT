I am with a group of people being held by some mysterious group, maybe like the Nazi's. I want to escape. I write out a list of those who had gone before me. I am documenting things as they happened before I forget. I write the list of those who died and therefore left in a bad way. Rosalie is on the list. A deaf man is another. I also write a list of those who successfully left for good reasons. To find a home, and so on. I see the list of those who remain is small and I "Barbara" am the last one on the list, as I am younger than the others.
