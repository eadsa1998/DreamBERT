[I fell back to sleep early in morning.] I had three minutes to get to school and I was running up a graveled path and across a lawn and missed the school building and went on into bushes where an older child, Charla, was crying. Then I realized I was dreaming and suggested to myself I go up and find the creative healing source. I felt waves of energy and I easily flew up through a ceiling and up into space and then saw lots of tan-colored spots that were my DNA. I thought of maybe coming out of the trance and encouraged myself to stay with it.
