I am in court and get sentenced to a year in jail. My sister-in-law, who has cerebral palsy and has always been in a wheelchair, gets out of her chair and starts walking and getting into everything, like a baby when it first starts to walk. There is a jury, a good looking male prisoner, and a friend who owns a bookstore is the judge but the courtroom is a theatre.
