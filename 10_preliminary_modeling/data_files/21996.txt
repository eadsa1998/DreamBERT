I looked out into a field and there were holes every so far apart where they were dug to put in valves for a gas or water line. This was prepared for a new housing project location. I saw the holes down a line all the way to some woods. There was a gang from White's. We lay down some boards and lay on them. There were hot biscuits on them cooling off. Margie, Juli, Ann and some other men from White's were there. I had one biscuit and then went away and when I got back, the biscuits were all eaten. Later we were up on a construction building looking out at something or watching for something to go by. I'm not sure what it was now, but we laid down some boards and stood on them looking out of the building. George G. got a check from a fellow and wanted to cash it, but none of his friends wanted to cash it. I spoke up for him, hinting he had a check that could be cashed to some of the big boys, but they paid no heed to me or George's check.
