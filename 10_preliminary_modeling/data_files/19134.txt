There had been a lecture going on earlier about projective drawings. The instructor, who was a male, had been talking about pre- and post-test results and he had been talking about one particular case which I think was a murder or some other type of criminal protocol. Somewhere along the line I had been a subject in a hypnosis experiment and it seems as if some drawings were going to be made by me while hypnotized, but I had not achieved a sufficiently deep state of trance. I had not quite awakened, but I did not seem able to progress any deeper into the trance. The hypnotist was saying something about if I had enough confidence, I could let my eyes roll to the back of my head and this would produce the desired depth of trance. I'm not sure whether the hypnotist was also the instructor or not. Then it seemed as if I was almost awake and the instructor was holding up an ink blot to the class and asking them what factors or what determinants could be used on this particular card. He then asked this question specifically of one girl in class, but she did not reply immediately, and one of the men to her right spoke up and said that you could use color, shading and texture. The card had some purple coloring on it. The class seemed to contain about 20 or 30 adult students. Then it seemed as if a voice were reading a protocol and at the same time an ink blot was in sight, so that the students could know which areas of the card were involved as the voice described different details of the protocol. One thing mentioned was at one part of the card there were two mice that were colored purple, and then there was an explanation of how they came to have this unusual color along with an explanation of how the scoring for each dream was determined.
