I was around where they were building something and there were holes or trenches and part of them were covered and some were open. I told a fellow to buy or get me something and he would win a raffle. He did and something went wrong and he was after me. I ducked into one of the holes and he ran by me. Then I came out and I made off I was someone else. I threw away some of the end tickets and it was a winner. We were playing with a toy train. The cars would turn over and fall on one section of the track. I was told that the cars were looking for girlfriends and there was a little chipped off once in a while and that is what makes the cars wreck. I was parking a car and it wouldn't hold on a grade. I put it in gear and it held there. I bought a four-wheel cart or buggy. It had rubber wheels and I was pushing it home over the bridge and up a hill by some tough chained watchdogs. When I put on the emergency brake on the car the brake handle came out about twice as far as it does. It must have been broken because it would not hold the car on a small grade.
