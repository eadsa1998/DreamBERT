I am now returning to the acting class. I go too far down the hall to a room where ritzy, well-dressed people are. I back track and find the room. The woman teacher is there and I ask her if she would mind if I could be an assistant director. She says, "How will this help?" I start counting on my fingers how it would help. "First, for me," I say and I pause and repeat it because it felt selfish to say for me first. But I decide it is proper and I say, "For me, I would gain skills and experience. For you, after I learn blocking, I could run some of the rehearsals and you could have time off." "I'll have to ask the class," she says. I agree and point out one woman will say no. She doesn't like me. So I tell the class how I've married this Protestant. They ask if my father is angry. I say, "No because I divorced my Catholic family." Then a woman sadly says, "At first, he won't read your letters and then later, when he dies, he'll speak of you in his last words." She cries. "It was like that with her dad," someone says. "But your sister will be angry and hurt." I agree it was like that with my father. They vote me in, all except the one woman. [BL]
