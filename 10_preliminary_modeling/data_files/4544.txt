["Villainous behavior."] I am in a family. I and my "sister" are going out on a date with bad guys. I take a photo of them and us and write a blackmail letter. I am going to hold it against them. We walk out the door. The bad guy makes some aggressive threatening remark. I bluff them by ripping up the photos in small pieces but I cleverly don't throw any away. I walk back into the house and find a place to hide the pieces, knowing they will try and get them. I am a little afraid I will be hurt.
