I was showing Mom a bit of the first episode of Chuck. It was really weird. Chuck walked into a room and he said something weird and his sister was sitting in a corner with a bald head and said "Anton!" and I laughed and told Mom that I'd forgotten it started off weird. Later I was playing a game and this girl was going for a job interview and her choice of clothes was a Pokemon shirt. Then I was the girl, but not. The door to my room was back to front. I called out to Mom "I'm going to a job interview but I can't lock the door". I told Mom we had to take the keyhole off and switch it but she said it would take away the auto lock thing. I said I didn't care. While I waited for her I was going through the stuff on the shelf in there -- it wasn't my stuff. There were movies; one was the "original Red Planet. Oh there's like 1800 of them". Some of the covers were faded the rest had red covers. There was a movie that started with an 'I' (I think it was called Ilysum) and it was French sounding. The girl on the cover was from something and I told Ezra it was really weird "like almost David Lynch". There were pictures as well and one was of Malcolm McDowell from A Clockwork Orange and I said "Oh, I'm so taking these". Dad was at the table and I thought he was at my spot, but he was in the one next to it. He was eating something.
