These people were in this mental hospital. There was this worker guy and he said "6'6", blonde hair and now look at my girlfriend" or something. I was at school and it was home time. I got out later than Eugene and was walking right behind him. He walked up the Year 8 block, and I figured that he was meeting with Bradley. I got to the car and Mom and Ezra were there. Mom was asleep. She was going to take us home because she was really tired.
