["Marrying Woody Allen."] I am in my 30's and good looking and slim. A man is attracted to me and is flirting. I am enjoying the attention. Now a man like a younger Woody Allen is there. I am attracted to him. He is funny and fun to be with. We enjoy each others company. He is showing me a trick where he pours water into a pot of dirt and puts seeds in it. The water is slopping over the edge a bit as he pours. It is very runny dirt. As I watch, I notice we are in a banquet room. I decide, since this trick will take a while I'll go to my place setting and have dinner. I wear a lovely blue velvet gown, like Katie in the play. I wander down a hall to another door and go in. I see the place where my dinner should be. I don't have a chair. I go to the other side of the table and start to take Woody's chair. Then I see the nice man I'd been flirting with had moved a chair there for me. I sit. He is seated on my left. We chat pleasantly, still flirting. I feel slightly uncomfortable and point to a picture of Woody in the newspaper and say My new husband is this man. This is to alert the man I am married and I am proud of the fact. The man says he is an unstable selfish man. Did you know that? I say yes. A woman says he is a freak, always doing things differently. I say yes. That's what I love about him. I am unshaken in my enjoyment and love of my husband, even though I have to admit he is as they said.
