We were on holiday and I was at this restaurant. I think I was with Zim (Invader Zim) and he was blind. They started closing except they let us stay and then The Beatles came, though George was there and I didn't know why. Paul was, but wasn't, a girl. They said they were going to be there and George had pyjamas, a marker etc. I talked to them for a while and then I ran to shops for some paper but none of the shops had any and these bridges were delayed, and I needed to use the bridges to get from place to place. I finally got to a hotel and it was the wrong one and there was an evil person. Dad was in the pool. I got keys. The Beatles had gone when I got back.
