Driving home from work late.  There was a side road into a tunnel, a place I always almost miss, or always take the wrong turn.  I start to lose control, trying to turn too late, went up the left side of the road or tunnel, overcompensated, went up the right side.  Through this I thought, I might die now.  I didn't want to die but wondered about it, making the choice at that point about whether I wanted to die, or had survival instinct.
