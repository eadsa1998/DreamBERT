In this dream I was out of doors looking at a huge river and I was standing somewhere above the river and I could see a vast expanse of dry cracked mud between the fork of the river. I wanted to go swimming in one of the forks of the river, but couldn't decide in which one. The next thing I remember I was standing on the sand at the shore's edge. I ran, plunged into the river and swam out to a buoy. It seems I had picked the far fork or branch of the river in which to swim. I was with other people in the water, but am unable to remember anything about them (sex, age, etc.).
