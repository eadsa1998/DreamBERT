I was with Mom and Ezra in the car on our way to see someone pretty far away. All of a sudden she said "Oh shit, SHIT!" and I was wondering what the hell was going on. She was stopped on a patch of grass just off the road. I was sitting in the front and Ezra was in the seat behind me. A cop came to Ezra's window and knocked. Mom was hiding her stuff and then opened his window. He told us to get out because he was going to search the car. He handcuffed Mom to the car and we had to stand up against this fence. I didn't know what happened, but as we got back in the car Mom said he'd found some, but let her off with a warning. There was more in her shoe. The whole area was covered in cops.
