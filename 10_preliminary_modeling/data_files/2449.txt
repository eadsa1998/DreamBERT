I see a large auditorium and I go in to see the show and end up crawling over a chicken wire fence to get into the sandy pit where people can sneak in for free. Strange people are there. Two women befriend me and stand close to me, our three heads close together. I accept it, although I don't particularly enjoy it. I look beyond the pit where pretty people all dressed up are seated in chairs where they can actually see the show.
