 Many people are fishing. Some adults and kids are staying in cabins, while others are not. They may be fishing for the perfect fish. All the people huddle together in one area. I help move the kids up rocks. We're gathering because there is a big storm coming. I huddle together with two people I put my back to the approaching storm and snow: an avalanche is coming. We create air space in the middle of the three of us by the way we huddle. The storm is very powerful. It moves in from Forkville to Woodland. The avalanche pushes us along. I flip over a fence, landing in soft snow and sliding along. I'm not scared. This is fun! My friends Jill Banks and Holly Lapson, who has dreadlocks, are there. I never thought Holly would do this because it would make her hair all ratty and nasty. I say, "Yee-Ha!" as I slide. There is a fence there that I see. I am not very worried or too cognizant of it. It is past where we are. I don't know if we could get over it if we were pushed down to it. There is the danger of being trapped or crushed next to it.
