For a little while I was walking up a sidewalk on a road that needed mending. I remember climbing over piles of dirt and rocks. Then I was riding in a car with two boys, Leonard and John, with me in between. We were riding up a street lined by 2-story buildings. The outside wall of all the top stories was colored a brilliant deep sky blue. The sun was shining. The sky turned exactly the same deep shade of blue as the buildings so that there was blue, blue, blue all over. It was so bright and lovely that I almost cried. Next I was in a new, modern apartment on the first floor up on a hill. It had big light window sand pink decorations. When I walked in, I said, "This needs just a touch of blue." Then I looked around and saw at some of the little windows, flower vases, pillows, were blue. Outside was a porch, and below was a big tennis court for all the kids to play on. My brother was down there. At the time it was getting dark at twilight and I could see tiny lights in the distance.
