I dreamt about being in my college town.  I had to climb a steep rock.  I had to leave the Volvo there for some reason.  On the rock I was on, there was a lot of white rock to look like snow.  I started walking to my mother's Saturn along some railroad tracks and someone stopped and offered me a ride.  I declined and went to the doctor in a warehouse-like setting.  I stood on the broken back of a chair on a scale while they weighed me.  Then I went to a meeting for one of next quarter's classes.  Psyc 163 had an interesting pamphlet with lights all over the cover- very high tech, rich teacher, apparently.  The meeting though was for Japanese.  My teeth were loose.  Then, all of them fell out.  There were tiny ones in their place.  My mouth was full of runny blood and I didn't feel I could close my mouth the whole way- I was scared to.  I had my teeth in my hand, and I left the room.  In our garage by the attic there was a man on a telephone.  I pointed to the teeth so he might call a dentist for me.  My boyfriend Jeremy mentioned something about me.  The doctor said he could replant them but the anesthesia might make me get cancer when I'm 60.  I wondered if there wasn't another way.  I looked at the teeth- there were no roots, which would make it hard to replant them.  I looked in the mirror at my mouth.  There were tiny teeth in place.  Either get them replanted immediately or wait and see if these grew and solidified in place- I thought I recalled a tooth doing that before.
