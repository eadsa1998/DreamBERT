I was watching Lost, although I'm not sure if it was, and Locke and others (from other shows as well) had to break into this giant shed, which had planes in it, in the middle of the forest. Some of them were on a plane and Locke was trying to distract the people outside. He was then on the roof and this girl up there suspected him and threatened to tell and there was a long drop to the bottom. They were both holding on to the edge and she let herself drop but he kept edging along to the water and when he got close he let himself fall. I was then there with some others, outside and it was night, and we had to get in. There were guards, but lots of bushes and things to hide behind along the way. We slowly made our way to the shed. This girl sacrificed herself so we could go (they arrested her, and then we snuck in while they were busy). I watched some comedy movie [it was new and Apatow like]. It was ok. Jack Black was in it and they had this thing to get rid of fire, which was a gigantic grey flap thing and he said it "works like my kidneys" and it was at the door or window and it 'breathed' and sucked the smoke and flames out. I was telling Ezra if he'd seen anything else similar to it. I went to the kitchen and Mom was there. I asked her if she had some food and Darren said "pdf" and he said it stood for "do not prefer".
