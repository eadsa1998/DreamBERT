I was out with Earle Dilhon. He had a pet black snake. It must have been about 75 ft. long. He followed Earle around. I didn't trust him. I was afraid he would bite me. I always stayed far enough ahead of him to make sure he was not close enough to bite me. Earle and I got away from him. Earle told me about a fellow who would have a dream and figure out a horse that would win. I told him I had dreams that I figured the horses out. For example, I said I was sad in a dream because someone died. Then after it was all over with everybody including me were jolly and happy. So the next day Happy Queen was running and it won, paid $11.50. We walked back to where we left the snake and I looked over to the left as we walked by and I saw the black snake lying stretched out full length like dead. I called Earle back and said, "There's your snake. He's dead." Mike Arendas said he ran over his head with his three-wheel bicycle and he started to curl and twist, then tried to go under water, but he died. We went to a banquet. We had seats where it was reserved and big shots had their seats there. The boys from White's gave me a whole ham, except about a pound was missing from one end. The ham was lean and nice.
