The U.S. government has taken over several insolvent golf courses in the vicinity of Washington, D.C. One of these charges only 40 cents greens fee because of the poor condition of the course; another, called "Washington Golf Club," has same arrangement of holes as at National Women's, but with bunkers like the worst of those at Ellicot City, wide, very deep. The club is characterized by 2 striking peculiarities, 1) it charges $1.00 greens fee, 20 the bunkers are constructed with an overhang, so balls cannot be rolled out by knocking them against the bank.
