We went upstairs to a long hall with several doors on each side. Passing the first two on the right they told me that Livesay's children lived there. In the first apartment was Mary Livesay, now 40 years old and the only child of both parents. I though the others were theirs by previous marriages; but where is he? But the others had gone. In a room at the left, I saw many people seated in chairs. Concluded it must be a doctor's waiting room. I tried the door. Then someone was trying to get out. I pressed more then one part of a complicated lock, and finally she could get out. She thanked me and I asked if that was Dr. Livesay's office. She said "yes". I went in but now the room was dark and bare and a double door was at the far end. Another person and the nurse coming out took him first. I felt annoyed. Then I thought, "but why do I want to see him? He is not an M.D. Perhaps for psychotherapy but he doesn't do that." Anyway, why see an M.D. I've passed that exam for King's Daughter's home. (I did pass that physical exam soon after and moved to Home Apr. 1, 1960.)
