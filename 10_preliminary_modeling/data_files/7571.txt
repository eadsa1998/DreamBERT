I had left my office for a few minutes and when I returned there was a message for me on my desk written on a piece of white paper. The handwriting was barely legible but I could make out the message.  Mary had called while I was out but she would call me again at 4:00 pm. There was a phone number where she could be reached. I did not know whether to call her right away or wait until she called me at 4:00 pm. But I wanted to know who had taken the message and opened the door of my office to see if I could find the message taker. When I opened the door I was looking into a very large open-spaced office filled with very many desks. No one was there, except, several desks away and directly in front of me were Jerry Seinfeld, Elaine, and Kramer or George huddled around a desk. When I opened my door they just looked at me indifferently then went back to their discussion. I shut my door, returned to my desk and went on wondering whether to call Mary now or wait for her call. There were a number of plates and bowls in my office that more appropriately belonged in a kitchen. I woke up before deciding what to do about calling Mary.
