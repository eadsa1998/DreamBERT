I had remarried Darren and we were living in my townhouse. BJ and Kim H were there. Kim H started repainting living room. She had misunderstood something I said earlier about painting and started painting the wrong thing. Darren was being very mean to me. I heard BJ tell Kim H that she had never heard him talk to me that way before. I was kind of glad she had. Someone in the family finally saw how he treated me. We all started painting. I noticed on the wall behind the sofa that I had made a large rectangle out of the lighter shade of green but that it had dark green vertical streaks in it. It just looked like a messed up paint job. I didn't remember having done that or even remember it being that way. Some people weren't being very careful with the drop cloths and I was worried they were going to get paint on the floor or on the baseboard. It was getting very late and we were all very tired. Mike M called and said he would come over and help finish up if I wanted. When he first called I didn't recognize his voice so I had to ask who it was. I was so surprised and happy to hear from him. I asked him if he meant the offer and he said yes. I could tell by the tone of his voice he didn't really want to but that he wanted to be available if I really did want or need his help. I told him I really appreciated the offer but that it wasn't necessary.
