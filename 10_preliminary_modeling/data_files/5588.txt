[1997-06-03] We were at the house I grew up in and I had raised a big party. My 3 cousins who are brothers were there and we had cookies and shrimp salad and al kinds of stuff, but everything was together in the same area on one big counter and I was reaching and getting cookies to eat and talking in a very animated manner with my cousins about how wonderful my brother in law was and good he was to me, how he thinks of me and asks me if I need anything and I was saying "do you have brother in laws like that?" but of course they didn't answer, "as nice as mine are."
