I was on some kind of camping trip or something but it was sometimes Big Brother. It was late in the season and I was in there. People were playing pool outside. I was lying on ground reading something and occasionally making comments to myself. I was wearing a skirt or dress and it was tight and short. I had lost my undies so had to keep adjusting myself. Fletcher was also there and I forgot he was still here and he came and lay down next to me and I tried to ignore him. Later we went camping. Cecelia, Marcos and I went to this bridge over fast water and there was a pricier section that look like some fairy land with lots of kids playing. Cecelia find some old screwed up paper from fortune tellers and read them out. A yellow one said 'Izzy Conell' and was like 'you have go tell someone something' and I said Cecelia pre-planned this as prank. Marcos's one said he'd get arrested for drugs.
