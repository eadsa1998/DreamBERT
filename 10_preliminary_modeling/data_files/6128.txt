I dreamt I was on a beach with my family. I had a baby. It was a baby boy. I remember thinking, "I wish this were a dream," because I didn't want the baby. Then my dream skipped to my boyfriend's house. He and I were in front of the TV. Then a few of our friends came in and said that we should get married. Then I remember being in a restaurant and ordering food. Just as I was about to take a bite out of it the alarm clock went off and I woke up.
