I had joined a group at church. At first I thought it was a choral group. When I got to church I was running a little bit late. Joanne S was heading up the group. We were processing in with the priest. We had hymn books and we were singing. When it came time for the homily, Joanne S stood up and turned to face the congregation, right in front of the first pew. She had a baby with her. It was a grandchild. There was a table in front of her. She sat the child on the table. They were both wearing pink. She had this kind of a belt thing that she strapped around herself and the child to keep the child there securely while she talked. She started talking about how she prays. It was at that point that I realized the purpose of this group was to share with the congregation different ways to pray. After she finished I think one or two others shared with the congregation one way that they pray. Then after Mass, Joanne S said to me, I need to make sure that I get your phone number because I definitely want you to talk to the congregation about dreams. I pulled out a business card and gave it to her.
