 I am back in 8th grade. Things are being replayed, re-enacted. My classmate Gino Teavor is fighting Bill Shucks. I am with my friend Bubba Hacker. We re-enact the episode where I beat up my classmate Jay Heimer. This is what we do. We're in a classroom. There are three big tomatoes in front of me on the desk. I pick up one and toss it over my shoulder. I am a bit reluctant to do this at first. The tomato splatters on the desk behind me, making a mess. The teacher walks in. The teacher is my 8th grade social studies teacher Mr. Walter. He plays along with this and doesn't reprimand me for tossing the tomato. I have lasagna in front of me. When I try to eat it, it flips up and sticks on me, splattering. The teacher has put something in the lasagna. I realize I have been duped. I look up at the teacher and smile in my realization. He smiles too: he has tricked me.
