My wife Anita and I had gone to an airport at night to catch a plane.  We parked in a pretty isolated location and went into the nearest building, but couldn't figure out where to take our bags and whether to leave our car where it was.  We were early for our flight, but we were getting nervous that all the extra time was going to be consumed by solving these problems.  No one seemed to be around until an old man with a Western Union cap came up and asked if he could help us.  At first I worried that he was a panhandler or worse, but it seemed that he worked at the airport, and he was very friendly.  With his advice, we decided we would have to go to the main terminal and park in the long-term parking area.
