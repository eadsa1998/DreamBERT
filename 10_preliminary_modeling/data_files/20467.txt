I was in a place with other men. A man near me began telling me that I have feminine charms. I became angry and I told him that I have a man's body and he should leave me alone. Later all of the men took seats. (That man reminded me of someone at a printing shop I once worked in Manhasset and also a fellow student in a singing and acting school I once attended.)
