Susan J contacted me to see if I still had the things that Dorothea D had given to me as a donation for some organization that I was involved with. I don't know what the items were or what organization that was. I still have them because I had changed my mind about what I was going to do with them. Dorothea D wanted them back. It seems that a lot of it was clothes but there was something unusual about them that I can't explain. Susan J and Dorothea D came to pick them up. I think Dorothea D was trying some of the clothes on, but it seemed more like a little girl dressing up in mommy's clothing. It was certainly different that just her trying on her own clothing. Freda L also showed up. The three of them were acting very distant to me. I was very happy to see them, yet very sad when I felt the distance. I was sad that they didn't seem as happy to see me as I was to see them. It seems that we were together in a small town that we grew up in. All of the buildings in the town were being destroyed so the land could be used for something else. The people who live there were destroying their property and things themselves rather than having the company who bought the land do it. It feels as though Susan J, Dorothea D, Freda L, and I had decided that we wanted to say goodbye to our town on our own terms. There was one place in particular, a local gathering place, maybe something like a coffee shop. It was the kind of place that someone might describe as the heart of the town. It was a place where people always came together. People wanted to say goodbye to it together and on their terms not this company's terms.
