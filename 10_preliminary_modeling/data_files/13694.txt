I was at school in math. Mr Gutenberg was there. We were doing some weird results thing and it was like a 3D bar graph. There was "one drawn right and one with the right answer" -- one was mine and the other was Eugene's. It happened with another thing too. Selena was talking to Alejandro about family trees and he thought she said cheese.
