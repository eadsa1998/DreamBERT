A mission.  I was at the observatory in a sort of training institute.  I had to obtain something.  Ate some sort of cream soup and opened my locker to get some necessary items.  I checked a high ledge on the other side of the building.  I got things like a lock pick.  I crawled through a wet tunnel and swam back.  I thought about how it had been different from 'last time' as if I'd done it before.
