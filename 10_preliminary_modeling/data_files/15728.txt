I went to a forum meet-up. We were in a regular cinema seeing some movie but I'm not sure where we were. Quizzleygirl and Bignose were there. Initially I sat next to Big and I said 'hello, Bignose' but he ended up moving. I sat in the back row in the middle and no-one else was there. Benjamin was supposed to come but hadn't arrived yet. At the halfway point, he turned up and went staright to an empty seat next to Quizzleygirl. I was annoyed. Later he and someone else moved next to me. He was talking to the other preson and his arm was resting over my leg. I wondered what was going on. He moved it and later said a few words to me. After the movie, Quizzleygirl drowned or something. I took her out of the water and I was alone and I thought about just leaving her, but I thought I might as well give CPR a go and she came back on the first breath.
