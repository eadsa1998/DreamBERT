I am traveling hundreds of miles toward central (state) (or Calif.). I am on a small elephant! The freeway has become a hay field and we are walking through the mown hay in the hot summer sun. My elephant stops to get a drink and fills his trunk up with cold water and sprays it back over himself for a cooling bath. "Oh, no," I groan and try to avoid a bath. I help rub the water over his skin.
