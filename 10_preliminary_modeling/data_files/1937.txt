I'm in a car. I look in the rear view mirror and see the headdress of an Indian Chief. He's riding a motorcycle behind me. My car is borrowed from someone. It's falling apart. The fender is peeling of, the wheel is unsteady, the steering wheel ill sharpened. I'm in the passenger side steering. I ask Ginny who is in the back seat to shift to "D" for drive. She does. Then because we're all over the road, I scoot over into the driver's seat to take better control.
