I went on a retreat or to camp with others, seemed like Amwest employees.  Maria, the clerk I just hired, was there.  We got off a bus and were at this camp, for a couple weeks.  I was feeling good that there was other Latinos at this camp, so maybe Maria would meet someone.  It didn't happen, I felt like it was because she was too shy, but it was interesting I was trying to find her someone.  When we got back, I was inside the bus, and Jeff was outside, I could see him through the bus window.  It seemed like we were on a street in my childhood neighborhood, in Richardson.  Some big guy came over and picked Jeff up and made some comment about him being short or small, some dwarf reference, or some midget saying or voice.  I was incensed, so mad the guy would do this to Jeff.  Jeff gave the rest of us a look like, what the hell, why do guys do this to me, why all through my life do people have to make fun of me being short?  I felt really bad for him, but felt like there was little I could do.
