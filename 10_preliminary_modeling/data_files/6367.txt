I am at this party and Melanie is there. There are lots of people. I am going somewhere that Melanie's friend is going, so Melanie asks me if I'll take her friend for her. I said that I will let her know when I am leaving. I walk around this party and it is in such a big building. I walk down the stairs and then the building was also a store. I was looking through the soaps and some other girl in the aisle was looking for shower gel. She wanted Lemon cream flavored, but she couldn't find it, so she asked someone that worked there. They told her to go to Woolworth's and they might have that flavor. They said, "Look on the ground level at Woolworth's." Then I went to find Melanie and when I found her, I told her I was ready to go. She had decided that she was going to the place that I was going to. She asked me if I could still take her friend to where she needed to go. I said, "I will still take her, but we need to leave when I say I need to leave. I can't wait around for her all night," and Melanie said that it was no problem.
