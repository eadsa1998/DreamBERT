This dream took place partially in the loft-like area of an apartment building. It was like in the city where I now work, but surrounded by what seemed like a rural ranch-like setting. Like a summer camp. It had something to do with work. Like for a story. I tried to log on to Facebook, via my laptop or someone else's , but I found the files came out all strange and coded. At first I thought that it was an error, but when more people started to see the same problem, it became apparent that there was a virus -- and I had accidentally uploaded it somehow. Or at least I was used by someone else to help upload the virus. I went to the top of the building, and inside the space, I found the culprit. This setting was part of some organization from an earlier part of the dream that I can't remember well. I helped fix the problem, and was rewarded by being given a new laptop. It was an alienware . Very different than anything I'd get on my own. It was giant, though I could watch it from essentially across the room. And the speakers were loud. I went back to my apartment, which was a little like my real one, especially during the rainy evening hours when the light is gray and dim, and I went to sleep watching it. Though there were roommates around making me uncomfortable. I was excited about something, which was why I had a hard time drifting off.
