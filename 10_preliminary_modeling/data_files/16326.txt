My graduation party was in a week already, and that I was in there kind of inspecting and looking around to see how the tables and stuff were. And they had this like, they had made up a long head table, but it didn't seem they had put any table cloth on it yet, and it was this blue table that could seat three. And then they inter_____ these little square tables that can seat four. They put a blue one and two yellow ones together. So as a total, it could seat eight people. Well I thought that we could get more chairs if we took the yellow table and moved it over to the side, and we put Jeff and Nikki and Bart and Quinn over there, and then we could seat -- one, two, three, four, five, six -- we could seat six at our little table that we had joined and then we could have a total of ten seats. [laugh] That was kind of odd. And then we went up to this, oh, and in this ballroom they had like couches around the perimeter for some reason. And then in the, we were up at the counter and they gave us our, all the food for the buffet to take home so that we could keep it cold. That was strange.
