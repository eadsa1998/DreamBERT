 I'm at a Dairy Queen with a male police chief to my left. I order a peanut buster parfait. A young girl makes it. It has strawberry Quik-like powder on top, which I am not impressed by. To pay, I take out the wad of bills in my wallet and give them all to the girl. She takes a $10 bill from the stack and I take the rest of the bills back. For my change she gives me a $10, $8, $7, and $5 bill. I look at them and wonder if I'm not aware of the new $7 and $8 bills. So I say to the chief, "Look at this!" From the look on his face I know the two bills are counterfeit. I tell the girl to take the bills back and give me real change. She gives me genuine bills, which are playing cards in a cardboard box. The counterfeit bills she gets by breaking cards off a strip of cards that are connected. There are fish in the box. I may dump or strain out some of the water in the box. The girl working casts a fishing rod, and the line goes out into the water around us. The police chief and I try to promote this: her fishing, as opposed to her counterfeiting. Her lure is a fly-like Mister Twister type jig.
