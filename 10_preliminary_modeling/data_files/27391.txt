In my dream I am in a two-room doctor's office. The doctor's sex seems to fluctuate between male and female. There are two other patients in the office. One of the patients is my cousin (a girl of 23), the other a middle-aged woman unknown to me, accompanied by her two children. The doctor examines the middle-aged woman and tells her bluntly she has cancer of the pancreas. He then examines my cousin and tells her she has cancer of the breast. My cousin burst out crying and ran into the next office. The rooms of the office are doorless. The doctor examines me and makes no comment. I go to the next room and see my cousin. She is holding a ring box and crying. A woman is combing her hair and comforting her. The middle-aged woman offers to drive the doctor (now a woman) home. The doctor asks the woman if she will also drive me home and she hesitatingly answers in the affirmative. It seems that she and I live in the same neighborhood. She drops us off at the corner of my street.
