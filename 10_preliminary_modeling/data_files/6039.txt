I dreamt I was working as a hairdresser for this woman's private business in her home. I don't remember what this woman looked like or if she was a friend of mine, but in the dream we were best of friends. I only remember cleaning the shop and sweeping the hair off the floor in the beauty parlour. I remember her saying that she would teach me how to cut hair and for now I could just sweep. I remember feeling excited that I was going to cut hair. It was as though it was the only thing I ever wanted to do in the dream. (I have never desired to be a hair dresser in my life.) That is all I remember.
