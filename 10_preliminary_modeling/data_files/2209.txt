I am fighting a man. He's shooting at me with a pistol. If I stand still, he misses me. I am very angry at him, and I stand over him with a huge knife and want to kill him. It's all I can do not to kill him, but I force myself to calm down. After this ordeal I lay down and a man is there. I ask him if we can hug. He cuddles his head in my shoulder and I lay there with my arms around him like he's my child, only it was me that needed the comfort. Then he's Howard and he's sexually aroused and wants to make love. I refuse him and then say, "It's not sex that is the problem, it's that I never even wanted to kiss you the first time. I didn't even like that." I hoped I didn't hurt his feelings. I remembered he owed me $116.00
