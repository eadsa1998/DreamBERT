 I am in a car. My sister Ramona is driving. She is going the wrong way down the shoulder of a busy highway, at a speed of 50 or 60 miles per hour. I am going nuts!! I am very nervous and scared. We go to park the car. We're on a hill. The car is a stick shift. Ramona has trouble parking the car. The house we are at is that of people who have more money than we do. They have two vehicles, and a third tiny truck smashed in the garage. My brother Wally says he'll lock the door, because it's important to do that right. My truck is there. It is green. My dad is there and is going to drive it but he can't figure out how to do so. Ramona or my sister Heather is in the truck as well. There is another vehicle driving home. We have traveled to home earlier in the day.
