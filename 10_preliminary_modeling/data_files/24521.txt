I'm at a grungy bar. I'm told that the people who want to harm me would like to make a peace offering of 1000 roses. I say that doesn't sound right and point out the cost. A very tall impoverished black man (an Army vet?) enters the bar. He goes from one person to the next asking for money or cigarettes. He comes to me, and blocks my way out. I get up and deliberately walk toward him and tell him, "No," I have nothing to give him. I'm not intimidated by him. I'm going to walk right past him. Then I wake up.
