All of us students at the university were gathered in groups of 5 students. Each group had to present a piece of work related to the theology course. We were all in the classroom and the priest was present when suddenly we all started to undress slowly, boys and girls, until we were all naked. Each one did whatever he wanted, but in my dream the priest was no longer there. I was with two girls on some kind of sofa. We weren't ashamed of anything. I remember that everyone said that it was better to spend time making love than presenting a theology paper and so we did. This dream seemed so real that I felt pleasure and joy. That's all I remember about the dream.
