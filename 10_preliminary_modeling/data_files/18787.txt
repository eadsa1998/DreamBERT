I was over at the Bagg's house (friends of the family) just talking when we started talking to my brother who then came in. We found out his girlfriend was mad at him because instead of buying her a pair of boot-shoes for her birthday he gave her a pair of old boots that he had cleaned up which resembled the fashion boots women are wearing today. He did not want to go to the expense of buying her boots when his were good and we all thought it funny that he got away with it for a while.
