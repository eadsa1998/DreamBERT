I was watching Ugly Betty. Lindsay Lohan was back on but as a different character. Betty was hiding in a house and to be with Lindsay (I can't remember if she liked her or not). They had knocked the house down. These garbage guys said they'd been doing disposals for two people and something happened twice in 20 years (can't remember). Someone had been mean.
