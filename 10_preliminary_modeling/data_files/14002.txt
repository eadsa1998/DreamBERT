I was at school. In period 2 I decided I wanted to go home so I text Mom and I said to pick me up before 10, so I would miss out on lunch 2. I left class and Mom came and she said the office ladies had been really rude and they were going to make us talk to Ms Pascal. I was trying to explain that I was sick, because of those headaches I keep getting, but they wouldn't listen. Ms Southwell was also there. I got angry and pushed all the paper off the desk and went and sat in the car.
