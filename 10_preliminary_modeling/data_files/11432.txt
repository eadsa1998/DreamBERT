The beginning of the dream is rather indefinite, but it seems that out of the haze I had the impression that a fellow by the name of Dave Kats, 19-year-old and a sophomore at Ohio State, had spent the weekend at our fraternity house here on campus. Yet the frat house looked like one that is pieture in the movies. In reality and in the dream Dave Katz was dating a girl who I was very serious about. Dave was leaving the house, thanking me for the weekend and driving away still not knowing who I am and my relationship to the girl. [Note: the strange part about it was that in the dream his build, hair, large nose, etc., were quite distinct and accurate despite the fact that I have never met this fellow, seen his picture, or heard anything about him other than his name.]
