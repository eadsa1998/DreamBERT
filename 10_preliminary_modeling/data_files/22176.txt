My dream of last night could be called a series of scenes. First I was in a big field, alone, and nothing happened. Then my dream was interrupted by another scene in which I was in my room preparing my things for the university and having breakfast, and then worried about not getting to the university on time. Then I saw myself visiting a friend whom I hadn't seen in a long time. After this I awoke and had some trouble making order of the different scenes in my dream, without being able to relate them to each other. That's all.
