I was with my girl friend and my family, when someone came out and started shooting everyone. But we tried to get away. We couldn't do it. My parents didn't get out in time and were blown away. But the both of us got out and couldn't save anyone. We were in the hot downtown by the capitol. The sky was blue and it was hot, really hot.
