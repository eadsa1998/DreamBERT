 There is another trip to Australia. More people are going. The night before I go I call my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas. She isn't there and I talk to her sister Jessica. Jessica says Annie is leaving soon. She is rude on the phone, as if Annie is too good to talk to me on the phone. My brother Wally is going to Australia. I'm with my parents. We're leaving at the same time as the last trip to Australia: 11:00am. It is 9:30am now. It takes one and a half hours to get to the airport, because we're in Wilmerton. I have not yet packed, and am not prepared for the trip at all. I've waiting until the last minute thinking I've done this before and it's no big deal. I run with my dad to get ready. I have him pack near the inside corner of the L-shaped building where I live, which may be a school. My high school classmate Wyatt Belzer runs along side of me. I'm in a job employment office. It turns out that we leave at 5:00pm, not 11:00am. I look for my name on a card, to get some information about the flights. My cousin Rich Redding is going. I talk to a man about a job. He knows I am interested in sleep and dreams. My classmate Rebecca, from Brimson, is there. I have a long thin line of burned skin on my left arm. It is like a scar, but it is raised up. I'm at home, and the answering machine is flashing indicating eight messages. Wally is there and is all packed up. He tells me to check message number 11 on the machine. My mom's voice recorded the outgoing message, which I hear. On it, she confuses Wally and I, mixing up what we are doing in our lives. I'm with my mom. We are walking and talking in a large house. My aunt Sheila Redding is there watching television. I am sleeping in a room. It may be the night before we leave. My dream notebook is full of holes from a pen when I awaken! I am very angry when I see this! I tell my mom, and explain I want to use these dreams for a book. She comments, but seems not to care, implying I can have more dreams and use those dreams.
