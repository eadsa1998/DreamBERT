These aliens were from a planet with no emotion and looked like humans. I didn't believe them. At first, there was one, then there were a few. I did this thing to make a portal, but it didn't work. This guy and his friend tried to kill me with these big rocks. I threw them back. One hit the guy and bounced off him and hit the other guy. They were rapists too. Elijah was there. There were lots of houses and I was walking down the street. I was calling "Eugene!" because I thought that he'd been with me earlier. I went to this place which was where I worked, and it was creepy.
