I had to move or I was moving out of my apartment. But the new apartment that I was moving into wasn't ready yet. I was having a sense that I was moving with someone and that I wasn't. I don't know which it was. We were trying to find a place to live while we were waiting for our new place to be ready. There was like an old shed on the property that we were moving from so we were just going to move in there. We went to one side of this shed and someone was living in there. It turned out that it was somebody who had just moved their things in there without permission. When we told her that we had to move in there she left. Then we went to the other side and saw that there was room there also. It sounds like a duplex but the doors were on opposing walls. That side was full of junk. There was some kind of concern about maybe something we needed not being there. I'm not sure. Maybe there was no bathroom in it or no kitchen maybe. I just don't know. I went to check on the progress of my new apartment and they had the floor down but no walls up or anything like that. I started moving things over there, small things like lamps and such. They weren't in boxes, though. I was simply taking them over there and sitting them on the wood floor. I was talking to a couple of the workmen. I thought Oh well. I have all this stuff all over the floor now. Now there is no room to bring the furniture in.
