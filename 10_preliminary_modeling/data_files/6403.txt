I'm walking around downtown in my raincoat and hat, not really knowing what to do. A woman comes up to me and asks me for change, but I remind her that she's already asked me twice today. She groans and takes off to a group across the street. "Wow!" I exclaim to myself, "Amy is over there!" I hadn't seen her since Junior High, so I walk over to her and say hello. She gives me a partial hug and we talk for a while. After a brief conversation, I pretend to be a Mafioso, and I look across the street at all the brand new seventeen story magnificent gleaming coffee places. I hop across the street, and take off my jacket. An old lady walks up, and I whisper something to her in Italian. She nods knowingly, and disappears. I put my coat back on, look around shiftily, and go inside and get an espresso.
