I was in a back yard and it was raining. The back yard was sectioned off into two parts and the children that attend the preschool that I volunteer at are there. They started running towards a pool and I was struck with fear when I saw what the children were doing. I thought that they would fall into the pool and drown and that it would be my fault. I was afraid for their safety. The children told me it was OK for them to get so close to the pool, but I knew that it wasn't.
