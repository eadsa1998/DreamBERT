A man named Nate is addicted to some cough medicine. He is crazed by it. He grabs me and forces me into a lake. He needs to get across to get his next fix. He forces me to drink the medicine. I pass out  in a stupor and he drags me across the lake. When we get across, there is a cabin. We go in and I am passed out. Time has passed and he is starting to come out of the stupor. He holds me in his lap and takes off my wet clothes. He falls in love with me and begins to make love to me. Because of this love, he fights the addiction and doesn't take the medicine. It is painful for him, but he does it. I am in love with him and help him.
