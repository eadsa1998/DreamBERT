I was in the US on an exchange. I was walking down the street and saw Raquel and she asked if I wanted to come to the lake tonight. I said no. I went through a park with a lake and it had fish in it. I dipped my shoe in. I started back and it was around peak hour, but it was called something else like 'drinking time'. Everyone was rushing back. The school I was staying at had a 'hotel' lobby. There were four elevators. Others were waiting. One came and it was like leathery and wobbly. A woman said 'do any of you bother to help it before pressing the button? No? You die'. Someone joked about it going down and setting on fire. I slowly worked my way down. Each level was open. I got onto one level and a dark skinned adult guy was in this office. He led me to the woman's section on the third floor. A lady accused me of having stolen goods? I said I only just got the key for this level.
