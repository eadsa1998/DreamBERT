I dreamed I was in N__ Y__ with my family. We were out at a big building which someone said was M-- S-- G--. It was dark green with the sides open and extended for miles. We stood beside it for a while and then got on the subway to go back to the center of town. The subway was run on the same principle as a roller coaster. We went on a level for a while and then zoomed up an incline. Every time we stopped I was tilted to the side. Finally we got off the "subway" and stood looking at a large wall map of C-- painted as a mural and put on a cement wall. From there the dream is a blur. I remember my Mother sat in the seat beside me, however, on this "subway", and my Father was in front.
