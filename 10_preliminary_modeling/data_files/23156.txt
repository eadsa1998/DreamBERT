I took a jigsaw puzzle of the United States out of the floor of a closet and took it to another room where I was trying to glue it to a blackboard or some other kind of mounting surface.  But I found that at least half the states were missing, and I didn't remember seeing any more in the closet.  But when I went back, I started finding the pieces one at a time.  I remember in particular finding Arizona and a piece with all the New England states on it.
