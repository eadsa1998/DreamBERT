I had a huge dorm room.  I opened one door and it led into a large storage pantry with a fridge.  I put something in and went back, starting to kiss my boyfriend Jeremy.  All of a sudden bunches of people came in wanting to use the fridge or something.  It messed things up.  Somehow got them out, but my dorm mate Ray came in wanting to borrow something, and I had to hold back from yelling.  I explained I was not mad at him but at people in general.
