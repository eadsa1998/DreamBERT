My husband was planning to murder me. The first time I had the dream I let the whole thing play out and he was successful and it was a very frightening dream. I had escaped. I had managed to get out of the house without his knowledge. I was on the road for quite some time and then he found me, took me home, and tortured me for awhile. I escaped again. That time when he found me he killed me.
