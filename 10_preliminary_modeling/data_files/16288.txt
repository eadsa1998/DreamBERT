I remember I had a bizarre dream and I didn't put it on this tape for whatever reason. Maybe I did. I dreamt that Mrs. Dougherty had long, bushy hair and that we were going to sing at the pier. We were singing, "When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie, that's amore." And there's this -- as we were singing it -- there's this part that goes, "Ticka ticka too, ticka ticka too, ticka ticka too" and for some reason I got scared and I started grabbing people, anybody I could find. And Melinda was there; I think I grabbed her. And I had this basket of Easter candy I was trying to keep track of, and I was dropping things out of it. This was around Easter time anyway. And then when we were finished with the song, they clapped and they cheered for us, and it was just deafening, and that scared me even more. And then I woke up.
