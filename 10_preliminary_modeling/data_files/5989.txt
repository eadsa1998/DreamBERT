I am seated in an auditorium with many other people attending a seminar or training program. An announcement is made that the program is concluded and it is now time for all attendees to pick up their diplomas. A queue forms, and the person standing next to me in the line says, "You have to show the card you got when you paid the registration fee." "Oh", I reply, "I left the card in my room." I rush out of the auditorium and run through the hallways of what turns out to be a large hotel. I arrive at my room, and find my "roommate", X. (a male friend from college) there. "I'm getting my registration card", I tell him, but I do not find it there. Sensing that the card is back in the auditorium after all, I begin returning that direction. In the hallway I encounter Y. (a male colleague from work) walking past. "It's almost over", he informs me. "You'd better hurry." I run back to the auditorium to find it almost empty. A Strauss waltz is playing as a wooden partition or curtain is slowly being lowered over the stage. I run to my seat and see my receipt card lying there on top of my papers. Grabbing the card I cry out, "Wait! Wait!"
