During a nap I dreamt the phone rang, and it was my boyfriend Jeremy, as expected.  I commented on thinking so, and my roommate Chelsea mentioned that he only put one message on the answering machine out of the five.  It was him, though, and she was sitting on the bed.  I went for the phone but she refused to give it to me.  I grabbed her wrist and applied all my pressure in attempt to get her to drop it.  I was pressing hard.  I woke up to the phone ringing.
