I had to go to the laundrateria up at the corner. I took the streetcar (there is no longer a streetcar, it is replaced by a bus) and it was very crowded. I was standing right at the door, and I found that I was standing next to a former boyfriend of mine who I dislike at present and whom I was going with until September. He suggested that I get off with him to attend some kind of meeting. I did so. The meeting was outside on the corner. There was a mixed group with no one there whom I knew. Then another fellow came up who was the chairman, I believe. He offered to take me to the laundrateria. I accepted, and we drove over. We stopped the car and sat talking. I had never met him before. It was not where it is. It was a couple of blocks away, but we knew where we were going. It was set back from the street and was modern yellow brick.
