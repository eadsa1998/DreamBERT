I was in a department store, and a young saleslady was leaning casually against a package talking friendly with me. Outside the store a little later I met a girl about 19. We walked toward a grassy area, but a watchman stopped us and said no one is allowed there. We walked along the sidewalk. As we passed a wooded area, she said, "Let's go in those bushes. We can have some fun there."
