I was in a pub type of building and there were two floors. Benjamin was there, but I was on Skype and went to send him a message and it said something like 'user doesn't exist'. I decided to not send him a message on the forum, but instead leave a note. I asked the bartender guy to tell him he had a note and it said "Did you delete Skype?? WTF. Thanks. P.S. We need 1 new member to hit 500, I count it". Then I left and got in my car. I could see him through the window and saw him reading the note and he looked like a young Jeremy Davies. He took out his phone and mine was on silent, but I pulled it out of my pocket and he was calling. He looked at me through the window and he said he didn't delete it and mentioned that he was doing an assignment (which was why he hadn't been online). I started driving out and then I was walking and a guy flew over this hill and kept spinning around and bouncing off the ground and I was like 'oh my god, oh my god!' and hung up when the guy stopped. A bunch of people ran over and picked him up and straightened him out. He looked screwed, but he was alive. I called an ambulance.
