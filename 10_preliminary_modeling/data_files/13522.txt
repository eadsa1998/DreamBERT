I was with Mom somewhere. I was showing her TV shows. She liked Pushing Daisies and I was thinking that Lee Pace was hot. I was saying that season 1 concentrated more on character relationships and character. Chuck was barely in season 2. Then it was real and Mom didn't like Chuck and I think she liked Ned. I was somewhere else and it was the day before my birthday and I complained because of school and that I'd only watched two movies. I was then at Nana's with Aunt Sally and the others. We were playing cricket on an oval. Braden ran after the ball, but it was too far and she called him back. Ezra was telling Bryson about the first time he did something about South Park. The sink was full of dishes. There were some Kiefer Sutherland cards?
