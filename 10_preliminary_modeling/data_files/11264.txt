I dreamt I was in a church about to get married to a girl I work with. In the middle of the service I left the altar and went to the organ to sing a wedding song. After I sang, I came back to the altar and the service went on. I don't remember whether the service was finished, but the one thing that sticks in my mind is that I didn't get married.
