I was at home which was really different. Ezra and a friend called Andrew had had a fight and there was danger of Andrew killing Ezra and Dad was friends with his father and they organized to meet up and discuss it. I had to go too. It was like 1 or 2am. I turned off the lights at home to leave. Andrew had an older brother, who was there. Then it was a game and people came. I got a sniper and was shooting (it was like GTA 4). The game had sold out and this shop needed more.
