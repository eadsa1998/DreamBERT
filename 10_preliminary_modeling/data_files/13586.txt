I had stayed at Mom's. I got ready for school and drove there. Then I was on a bike and it was raining, but I was still 'driving'. Mom was walking behind me. Lots of people were around upstairs. Ezra was there too. The door names were weird. One of them said 'Smudgy' and I thought the other one said 'Smudgy Pudge', but it said 'McLovin'. My hair was normal and I hadn't had breakfast yet so I said that I wasn't staying here. I ended up at home and Dad was still asleep. It was 8am. Mom said I still had an hour to get ready. Dad asked if we wanted McDonald's for breakfast. I said I was going to eat breakfast at Mom's.
