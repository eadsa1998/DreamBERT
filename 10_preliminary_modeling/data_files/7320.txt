The curtains were blowing against the screens wet with rain. I asked mother if I hadn't better close the window. Then it seemed as if it were too warm and I had better open wider the two opposite windows as we were going out. I went upstairs for my raincoat. My parents and R were ready to go but I had to stop in the bathroom. When done I found they had gone but a short way and were waiting for me. When we got to the bus stop a two-year-old child appeared in father's car. Where did he belong? We asked several people including children in the houses there. The child started walking back. Perhaps he could find his way home.
