["Party time."] I am at a huge party. Lots of couples. Romances are starting up, dancing, broken hearts as couples find their partners getting together with new people. It is a house of many rooms. At one end there is a pivoted angle. Later I am the woman giving the party. I go from room to room hosting. One room is a bedroom where exhausted revelers are resting. One is a fuzzy yellow eyed "alien." I wake him and say its 4:00. You might want to rejoin the party. He's too tired and sleepy. I move on out to a kitchen with 4 stoves in it. I become aware that's a dream image.
