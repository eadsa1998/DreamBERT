I was at Nana's. Poppers had gotten a car by "ad-bibbly" and it was blue. We were outside, in the patio area. Margarita was there and I think she mentioned some new song and I called her an idiot. I got up and she noticed I was wearing my Beatles shirt and she said "Well, you like The Beatles!" and I said "Yeah, they're only considered the greatest band ever by everyone". I was then watching Lord of the Rings, but it was different. Orlando Bloom and Viggo Mortensen fell into some water. The others were trying to get over a mountain so they didn't know they had fallen. They were standing on a ledge just above the water. Viggo had a thing for the mountain. Orlando was complaining and then Viggo took down his pants and Orlando went quiet. They went into the water and steps inside a cave. It was then me and I walked up the steps and was then at a school with some others on a balcony outside a classroom. There were little kids with guns on the ground shooting, but not with real bullets but they still hurt. I hid behind a pillar. Later I was with Mom and Ezra in the car. A song was on and I was guessing the words but then realized it was a different version of a song I liked. I knew all the words. They put on some new song and it was a Snoop Dogg song. Ezra showed me the clip and Snoop just stood there waving his hands around. They also played Game of Love. I was then in a car with a guy and we were playing Warcraft, or talking about it. We were in a pro players game, but he was more of a noob than me. There were security guards outside.
