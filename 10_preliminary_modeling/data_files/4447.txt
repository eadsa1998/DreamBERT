["Back to work."] I am back at work in a counseling department of a college. I am straightening up my office. Bonnie comes in to work there too. Then a woman client is referred to me from the administration. She comes in and sits on the messy crowded couch. Suddenly she falls asleep, her head dropping and the lit cig she was smoking mashed into the pile of junk on the couch. I wake her up and take the cig from her and scrub it out. I tell her to go home and sleep until she is rested enough to come back and work.
