I'm in the grocery store parking lot and I'm on my way into the store when I see a really attractive girl. For some reason I know she's my ex-girlfriend's friend Andrea, but in my dream she's blond and a little hotter. She's like, "Hey, Toby, what are you doing Friday?" and I stumble on the question a little and then say, "Oh, I don't think I'm doing anything" sheepishly. Then she's like, "Good, we'll have to hang out FORE SURE (sexy)" and I'm like, "Cool." As I walk into the grocery store, I think to myself, I bet Micha would've been, "Hang out with you, of course," but then I think, "That's what makes my 'game' better because girls aren't threatened by me." It suddenly occurs to me that I am drinking Red Bull and the reason I'm in the store is to buy Yagermister and Red Bull. I notice that all the checkout cashiers are each of a different ethnicity and I walk up to the male Indian one and show him the two Red Bulls I have. And he takes them and says, "I'll give these back when I ring you up." As I'm looking for the Yager, I see Brian and he's like, "Dude, my Supreme broke down, man" and I say, "Brian, you drive an Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme, not "a Supreme." Your car isn't cool. Get over it." We walk outside and now it's nighttime and his car is on a steep angle and we really have to push hard to move it. And sometimes I have to push it more than others. As we roll it into the bank parking lot, I wake up.
