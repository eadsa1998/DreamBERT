My wife Bonita and I were leaving somewhere by car, somewhat suggestive of the Washington Monument parking lot.  Again it was at night, we were driving, and we came off a short hill to get to the exit from this place.  It had been raining hard, and the street was flooded.  There were some boards lying across the entrance, to be driven over, but the water in the street was a couple of feet or more deep.  We saw one abandoned car with water over the floorboards.  It was obviously useless to try to drive, so we got out and tried to fashion a raft out of some of the boards.  Some of them were ideally suited for that purpose -- already nailed together, in fact -- but all of them sank well below water level from our weight.
