For some reason I was talking to my parents' neighbor in Japanese, practicing typical greetings: "Hajimemashite...doozo yoroshiku".  He was speaking it too, correctly, which surprised me a little bit as I was expecting his jokey "don't touch my moustache" Japanese that he had told me a few years ago.
