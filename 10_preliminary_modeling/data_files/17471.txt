I was going to school at Disneyland again.  I was trying to get to the Science building because supposedly that was where the health center was.  It was a large, yellowish, mushroom-shaped building.  One elevator was also a bathroom.  Many of the escalators went to alternating floors.  Someone didn't want me there.  So I left and was going to come back.  I sat in on a class that my housemate Andre was teaching for the day, and I sat on the bleachers.  I skipped one of my own classes for this.  Then I went to a large lecture hall where Andre again seemed to be teaching- but this was the class I was supposed to be in.  Again I tried to find the health center but still had some time to kill, so I wanted to go on the rides, remembering that it was Disneyland.  But the rides didn't open until 6.
