Heather Locklear was going to exercise with me. We were talking about the fact that neither of us really wanted to exercise, or felt like it, but we knew we needed to. We were going to use an exercise video. I was rewinding the tape from the last time we had used it. I was having trouble getting the last few minutes to rewind. The tape didn't look like they do in waking life. The tape itself was much wider, maybe 4 inches wide. There seemed to be a strip of paper wound with the videotape. The paper was just as wide as the tape and about as long as the amount of tape still to be rewound - maybe 10 minutes worth. There was printing on the paper. It reminds me of the strips that some stores hand you with your receipt that have coupons and advertisements on them. I reached in and started pulling that paper out, realizing that's what was causing the problem. I was talking to Heather about this. She didn't think that was the problem but I was sure that it was. Then there was something about emailing someone some web links. She had a lot of piercings on her face, both eyebrows, one or two on her nose, one or two around the mouth area - lips and tongue. I was thinking that was going to be a problem when people see that on the web, and wondered if she would remove them so I could change that on the web page before I forwarded that link.
