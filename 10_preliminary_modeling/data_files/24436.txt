I am in a large empty house. My brother and I are dressed as soldiers; we are hunting each other. I see him before he spots me and hit him with a burst of 16. I walk the bullets up to him. Curiously, they make only a small BB pattern and noise. There is little impact, little of the expected striking force. In any event, he goes down and I immediately rush to his aid. I feel very sorry for him and for what I have done.
