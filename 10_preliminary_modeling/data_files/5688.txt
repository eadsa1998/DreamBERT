[1997-07-09] Katy is a young woman that I've know for 4 or 5 years but I only see her once a year and that's when we're both attending the same annual retreat in April.. This April, Katy was there and shared with us that throughout the year she had had a very serious, very involved illness which left her in a wheelchair. On this night I dreamed of Katy and I was in a room where she was and Katy had been healed, at least she was walking. There was someone calling her to them but she appeared to be walking toward them and I remember being very happy that she was no longer crippled.
