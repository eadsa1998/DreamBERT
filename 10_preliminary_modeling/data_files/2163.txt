I'm in a store and Bonnie is pushing my manual wheelchair. I see big crystals and jewelry. I start to go outside and see a man watching me. He seems friendly and I am attracted to him. Bonnie waits for me in the car. I go out and he's out there. I see a turtle with a leather coat over his shell. The man says, "May I have that?" He really wants it. I agree. We circle it and it starts coming closer to me. I back up into the comfortable arms of the man. The turtle comes very close and bites me. I see a tiny bloodless paper cut and say, "Ouch! Is it poisonous?" The man says, "No. It's harmless." [BL]
