About 8 of us were going somewhere in a little coupe. We were out in a sparsely settled snow-covered country. Everyone was laughing and talking and suddenly, but without any noise or disturbance, the car stopped. I saw that there was a white snow-covered obstacle obstructing the passageway. Someone said it was a truck. I looked to find out and it was. Some of the boys got out and only two others and I remained in the car. I was alone I in the back seat. I propped my elbows on the back of the front seat and asked my friend, thinking my date was out of the car, "Say, Pat, what's my date's name anyway? Don't tell him I didn't know, but I was never introduced." Pat laughed and said, "He's sitting right in front of you, ask him yourself." I thought this was pretty funny and made some remark I can't remember. Suddenly the boy turned around and all I could think was I've never seen him before in my life. And the next thing I knew, someone said the truck was gone and the car was full of people again and we went away.
