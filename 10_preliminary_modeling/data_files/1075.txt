In a house. I'm still married to Howard. Lots of cats are on the front porch. They've broken a screen so they can go in and out as they wish. I think, "My what a lot of cats." Someone asks if I put their food out where they can get it. I comment that they can come in and get it any time they want. The girls come up to me and tell me Howard is dead. I say, "No he's not, he's asleep." I look out to the back yard. He's sleeping in a lawn chair. I am embarrassed that the girls said that in front of the neighbors and I am sort of hoping it's true. Then I feel badly about hoping he's dead. I think, "Why are we still in the same house? The marriage has been dead for years." Lots of things. I'm cleaning up the kitchen. A poster with the 4 basic groups of food is written on it, in my handwriting. I think about throwing it away because I know that so well, but I just can't. Somehow, I may forget and need to be reminded. I straighten out my jewelry. My wedding rings are there.
