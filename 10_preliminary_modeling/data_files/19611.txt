It seems that somewhere along a motor highway there lurked a band of blackmailers. They stopped people and forced them to take a ride, sometimes a very circular, short one which was hardly longer than turning a car around in the street. After the ride is finished, the victim is forced to pay a certain sum of money. I am caught, and take the ride, but for some reason I, and another person, are excused from payment. A day or two later, however, the blackmailer who had accompanied me in the car came to see me and demand money. I meet him in the mall, just south of the west end of Building "F," he is sitting on a park bench. I put him off, telling him to come again next day (Friday), but he doesn't want to come again until Saturday. I suggested that when he came, he should sit on the bench, or in case of rain, go into entrance of Bldg. F. In showing him the entrance, I knelt down on 1 knee, and the blackmailer, at least for the time, seemed to be a child. I pointed out the steps in front of entrance. My plan, in delaying payment to him, was to have a witness, perhaps a police officer, in one of the rooms of Bldg. F where the whole transaction could be watched; and in imagination I could see myself giving him a $5 bill to start with, and then handing him, one after the other in an almost endless string (so that witness would be sure to see at least some of the money changing hands) $1 bills. And if the blackmailer became suspicious and said, "Give me all of it at once," I could say, "Take it as it comes, or return everything to me."
