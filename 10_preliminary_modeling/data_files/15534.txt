I was at university and Dad introduced me to Audrey Tautou who he had met there. They were hanging out. At one point she was talking to Ryan, who also went to Westland, about how Amelie was originally not going to be a film, talking about the script and 'talk' and she said "not the right... what's the word?" and I said 'medium?' and she said 'median'. Later, Dad gave me this wine in a fancy bowl/glass and mixed them together and it exploded.
