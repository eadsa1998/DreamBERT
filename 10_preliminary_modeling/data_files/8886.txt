There are eight people who are going to be meeting with me on a regular basis for a few months. For some reason I think that some of them might be meeting with someone else. I tell two of them that they will be required to meet only with me. This doesn't really make sense as they should all be meeting only with me. These ongoing meetings are going to be more like therapy sessions than research interviews. I had singled out these two specific people because of something they said or something I saw in their data. Whatever it was I didn't want it to be distorted or altered because they were speaking with someone else, by them or by the person they were talking to. I didn't want someone asking them the wrong questions or saying anything they shouldn't to them because of something they just heard.
