I was at a deli in the lollies section and they were expensive. Mom said to just get individual packets because it was cheaper. They had the pineapple lollies. They also had these weird "John Lennon" Santa lolly. Someone called Dad and I answered and they said they were going to the UK and that no-one could stop them.
