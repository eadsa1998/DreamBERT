I was at home or something and there was a massive spider thing skittering about. It had a 'tail' which dragged along. Someone else and I were on a bed and too scared to go down. It had a head on it that like had a human head inside it (an image, I think). There was some other creature as well which was rubbing its head on the spider. I grabbed this tennis racket thing and they grabbed this other thing and we hit it. I felt bad but we kept going until we thought it was dead. We tied rope around its head. Then it turned into a person and they were dying. It looked like Bill Bailey and he was a friend of ours and he confessed his love to me and I had just started going out with his friend who we worked with. We thought he was going to kill us or something, but then he was ok and we were in the shop we worked at. I knocked over a thing of flour and went to pick it up, but it spilt and I got flour on my hands. Bill Bailey was walking out and I deliberated on what to do and then went after him and tapped his back -- he was wearing a denim jacket -- and said 'it doesn't have to be weird'. He said 'I have to see you and [the other guy] falling in love every day' and I went silent. We went to this deli to get ice-cream -- I got a chocolate vanilla Cornetto thing. He tried to pay by card but they wanted the expiry date of this thing and he didn't have it. I had no money or anything on me either.
