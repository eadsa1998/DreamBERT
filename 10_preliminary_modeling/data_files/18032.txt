I was out on the playground and I found a cricket and I kept it and it had a little baby and then we went on a boat ride, a submarine, and we had animals in it, like it was a veterinarian care center and then the submarine started to shake and I said what's happening. The cricket was inside my lunch pail and then the veterinarian started to collect the medicine because she thought the submarine was going to explode and I helped the animals not to be afraid because the cages were shaking. In a bottle there was a little baby pelican.
