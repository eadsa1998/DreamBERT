I was hiking somewhere for an overnight backpacking trip. Dave was there and Roy. Also Bill. It was night and we were meeting on the hill, then we walked somewhere else. Bill and Roy were ahead of Dave and me. Then Dave and I were climbing a plastic fence. It went up and up and was loose. It started to fall; I fell to the ground into brambles and realized I should have let go of the fence. Then I was in a car with Peg. She was DaveÕs mother and was asking about Dave. I didn't know what happened to him but I said he might have stayed to visit friends. I was surprised that Peg was DaveÕs mother because I'd never met DaveÕs mother and he'd told me a lot about his mother and she didn't sound like Peg.
