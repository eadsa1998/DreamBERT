 I'm at a party in my house. We are getting pepperoni pizzas, and offer to pay one-third of the cost, which is more than my share, since there are five or six people eating it. There is a buffet-like setup as well. Something happens in my sister Ramon's room. I urinate with lots of people next to me. Someone is wearing a sturdy brown construction belt. A girl talks to me about another man, whom I later learn to be my old basketball teammate Ron Lind, "He kissed me and sucked my tits." She says it in a way that makes it sound like she was harassed. I say to her, "Did you suck him off?" We get in a fight.
