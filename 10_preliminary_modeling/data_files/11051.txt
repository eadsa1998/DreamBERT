I was in one of my friend's home, but I don't know whose house it was exactly. There were boys and girls there that I knew. The boys wore tuxedos and the girls in formals. There was a formal that night and I was waiting for my flowers. When they were delivered, I opened the box and admired the beautiful flowers. Then I suddenly realized that they were pink flowers and I could not wear them with my coral dress. I became quite excited because I had asked for a white flower. Somehow there was another box and in it was a white orchid. I did not want this because of the purple center and because I just do not care for them. I took up the boxes in a very bulky way with the flowers sticking out of the boxes and started going up the stairs to get my coat to go back to the florist and exchange the flowers. As I was going up the stairs, several boys were standing at the top of them, around the railing, waiting for me to go up so that they could come down. I was next in a car going to the florist. My boyfriend Dan was driving. There were 3 people in the front and 3 in the back. Dan's mother was sitting in the back seat with two other boys and I, Dan and another boy were in the front. We were driving through the countryside and discussing the problem of exchanging the flowers.
