I was doing computer work for someone, but I can't say for sure if it was CAS. It seemed to either be work on, or related to, an eNewsletter. Everything I did, I had to do in two places. I don't know if it was because there were two very similar things or that it was one thing documented in two places. I was also pointing out to someone that I had set up the project so that when you changed some things it the software would automatically make some other changes. This significantly reduced the amount of time it took to complete the eNewsletter each time it was being published.
