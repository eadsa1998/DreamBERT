I dreamed I owned a red Ford. Since I couldn't drive, I asked a boy whom I thought was Jimmy L. (22) who married a friend of mine, to drive the car for me. We got into the car and he put his arm around me and started the car. We got to a railroad crossing and I suddenly realized the boy was not Jimmy L. but a stranger. I told him to get out and give me back my car. He refused. I became frightened and ran out of the car over to a railroad employee who was standing on an elevated platform. I was afraid the stranger who had my car would shoot me or run after me, but he didn't. I yelled to the railroad man to get the license number of the car. He did, but as soon as the stranger drove away with the car, he changed the license plates so that the police couldn't locate my car. Finally seven years later I got my car back.
