Someone had ordered these 'sex' guys for a party. At first it was just me, Diana, and maybe someone else sitting in a room. These 3 guys come in and started forcing themselves on Diana, maybe kind've raping her. It was uncomfortable and I tried to stop them (there were only 2 then). One of them, a blonde guy, turned on me and began doing the same thing. It turns out that these weren't bad guys doing harm, but instead they were 'pleasure' guys - really hot, sexy, great bodies. This guy would toss me around into all different positions, do things to me that felt great. I didn't do anything to him, I was a pure object, and it was fun! I did everything imaginable with this blonde guy. He was perfect. Diana had been messing around with the brown hair guy who I said looked like a young Robert DeNiro. I remember asking the guys where the third guy was, the Jewish one. Right then he came out of a room.. An ugly guy, old, with a mustache, potbellied and hairy chest. I was glad I had my blonde guy. I feel like I fell in love. The guys had to leave and Diana asked how it went. I said it was incredible. She said she hadn't slept with the guy because... afterall, he was 'hired'. I was nervous. I had forgotten all about that. I had slept with the guy many times without a condom. I thought back to the sex we had had and woke up feeling really refreshed. [Diana = good friend]
