I can't remember properly, but people were doing this weird jokey thing of asking someone on a date because you got something at the end. Troy (Community) was asking me about it and then asked me and I said no and we both laughed. I said to ask Abed. There were some big vibrators nearby and someone had changed the batteries recently and I was joking with them that they didn't know where they'd been. Victor (BB5) was in a shop and this girl who liked him was trying to get with him. She was fat and ugly, but nice, and so he was trying to politely reject her. She was rubbing herself on his groin area and he looked uncomfortable.
