I am looking for a motel with Bonnie. I pass one with blue flowers near it. Someone else will check it out. I go into a big hotel. Bonnie and a baby girl are there. The girl is about two years old and wants to share her drink with me. She puts her blue cup up to my lips and tips it upside down. Clear liquid pours into my mouth. I notice there is mushy food stuff in there as well. I avoid the gunk and drink the liquid. Bonnie exclaims about how the little girl seems to like me.
