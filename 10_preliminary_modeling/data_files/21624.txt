We were living in the north in a town. I talked to a real estate man and said if they were going to build in Ontario, which was quite north, and he said, "This is as far north as they would go." He also said we could get a big blizzard and it could kill off about three million people. This made us kind of leery. I met some of my boyhood schoolmates, Jamps Tipon. I walked thru Rivertown, my boyhood town. I looked into the homes and to my surprise, there were people living in all the homes just like old times. I was surprised and thought where are these people working because the mine was closed. The town was revived. I was up north again. Three fellows had gold. One fellow weighed it. It was in containers. Two of the containers weighed the same and one was a little lighter. Then he walked away. He didn't want to. Ok, this one is saying for a three-way split. The other fellow went over and weighed the light pack and gave it the ok stamp. I was going to leave the next day to go home and the big man asked me if he could ride with me. I said ok. I was driving my car and another car. I was driving by remote control. All at once the remote control car started to come towards the left to my car. I stopped my car and the remote control car crashed or collided into another car head on. I saw 7Ã‘7 for a fraction of a second. I wanted to know what p.p. a horse would run the next race.
