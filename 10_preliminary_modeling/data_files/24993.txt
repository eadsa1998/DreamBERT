 I am in a quarry-like structure. It is filled with water that is cold and deep. There are rocks on all sides. I'm at the surface of the water. There is a treasure or something valuable or spectacular way down deep. One needs to scuba-dive to get to it. I'm not ready to go down. The rocks are slippery. If I let go I will sink quickly in the water. I need to get something before I go down.
