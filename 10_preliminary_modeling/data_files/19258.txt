My brother and I were in a big dome that was a court room. It seemed familiar. The dome was huge - 10,000 seats. There were old judges around us, male and middle-aged people. I didn't know them. They were just authority figures to me. The old men were making fun of my brother and me because we were out of place and we were saving seats for these other kids that never came. At the first entrance of the dome was a bar that you had to make communion at in large glasses. At the bar it was just me and this guy I just met. He was old. I was telling him about a dream I had. I said, "Hey buddy, I had this dream last night," and he cut me off and seemed to remind me that dreams are only interesting to the people who have them. I got pretty mad and pretended to push him but said "psych." The guy wasn't mad. He looked disappointed and walked out. He had a tattoo on his hand of a cross - I didn't notice until I had insulted him. I felt bad and tried to apologize.
