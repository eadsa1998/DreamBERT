I was at a place with Calvin and he had a little sister called Sunny. At first it wasn't me and Calvin, it was two people and they were in a Lord of the Flies situation and they had their own plates to sit on. I had a tree full of food and something else. I got Sunny to bury a bag before some man came. When she got up to us, she was older. We got caught by some dudes. They had powers. Some persons father could fly and do stuff with birds. Their mother could smash rocks and stuff. We were supposed to have powers too.
