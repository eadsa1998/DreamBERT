I dreamed my date and I were in the back seat of a car while friends of ours, another couple my same age were driving recklessly fast to make the one o'clock deadline at the dorm. Usually, I'm secretly afraid of going at high speeds--even when I drive. But in the dream, I laughed at our recklessness although everyone else was silent.
