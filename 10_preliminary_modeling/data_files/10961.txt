I was at school getting ready to come home for vacation and my sister was helping me pack. She is 17 and lives at home in Michigan. I didn't know what to pack but I finally decided and laid out my things in my drawer, ready to put in my suitcase. My dresser was for some reason in my father's room. When I was ready to leave, I went into my father's room to pack my suitcase. He woke up and said that if I'd wait a few minutes he'd get up and take me. I was already home but my father said he would drive me home.
