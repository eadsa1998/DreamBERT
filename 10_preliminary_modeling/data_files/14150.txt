Selena and I were hanging out. We were staying in some hotel room. We had these little boards for in the pool, which holes for your hands at the flat end and a curvy end at the other side. First, I just was out and she came and we decided to use them. We had bathers on. There was water in the hotel. It went uphill and I kept choosing the bad path. We were talking about driving and the speed limit and I said I "sometimes go over, but go straight back down again". She said Brianna had said I had a "[something I don't remember] finger shirt". There was a pool and this lady said we weren't allowed to have the boards in there. We had to distract this dog for a certain amount of time. We took the dog and she went after it and we ran away. She followed it.
