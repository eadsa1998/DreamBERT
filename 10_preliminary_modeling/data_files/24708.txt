I climbed down from my bed to a microwave, and flew through the night sky with my friend Claire and a talking acorn. Then we all got wings of an orange butterfly and my Prek teacher's face appeared (the one who calls me Anne Butterfly because she had names for all the kids) came into view, and said "fly." We flew down to bed with Claire near me and when I woke up my pillow was beside me. Setting: In bed, and in the sky. Characters: Claire, my best friend who has red curly hair. Polite, fun, happy-go-lucky. Feelings and Thoughts: Content, happy. Excited and thrilled.
