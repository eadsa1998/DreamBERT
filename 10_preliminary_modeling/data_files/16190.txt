First of all, I dreamt that Mom's boom box could take the words out of songs for me, and send them over to the CD burner and burn an instrumental copy. Then I dreamt that we were reading this book about this crazy girl who wanted to, who made us want to climb diagonally up the side of a church, and see, the thing of it was you were supposed to climb diagonally up the side of the church to get to this really pretty picture, but little did we know, in like a little chariot-like type thing on the roof of the church on either side there was a bad girl who did like bad things. And we were walking through this museum about this story and it was so boring, and everybody said it was going to be boring. And for some reason that mother was going to HRS because she sat up in that chariot and did like bad things. And then I dreamt that some truck driver put this big stone tunnel in our driveway for some reason and that he wanted me to crawl through it and see something. And I told him I didn't want to because of the book we read.
