Freda L had sent some kind of cards in the mail to me, Susan J and Dorothea D. They were only about 4 x 4 inch squares and opened from the bottom. They each had a little hand-written note taped to the outside of it. She didn't realize that she had forgotten to take those notes off before she mailed them. The notes were okay for Susan J and Dorothea D to see but not me. When I read the note I was very upset. Sad or depressed or both. There were several things about the note that really bothered me.
