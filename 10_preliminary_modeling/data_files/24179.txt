My dream is fuzzy, but I was back in my dad's old house that he lived in about 10 years ago. I was walking around where my old room was. My dad was there and his girlfriend, we were all close. I didn't live there, I was just visiting for the weekend. There was some sort of chaos, but I can't remember why. I think I was looking for something. Everything was as I remembered it. My dad's office was right next to my old room. I remember seeing both. It was in the afternoon. I remember also my friend Kay was there, she's my age. We used to hang out there at my dad's beach house. I had this dream a few days ago while I was visiting my dad in his new house, who I haven't seen in about a year.
