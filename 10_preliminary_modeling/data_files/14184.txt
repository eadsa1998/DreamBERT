I was in some building with the school. We had been practicing this game and it was now the official exam or whatever. We had this strip straight in front of us and a hot air balloon at the end. We had to go down the strip and get something. I didn't have a balloon on mine. Autumn was next to me. I got the first thing and the lady said I was disqualified and I had no idea why. She said that you had to stay within the width of the balloon when doing it, but I said we didn't have to do that when we'd been practicing and that I didn't even have a balloon.
