I am swimming in a huge ocean and the waves are a solid wall of water. I feel fear that Ishall drown and decide that discretion is the better part of valor. I turn to swim back to shore but the waves that way are smaller, but more turbulent. I'm in trouble no matter which way I swim. Why am I there in the first place?
