I am in a little village and I have both my hats. The Stetson and the Akubra. I am very proud of them. They're beautiful. Then I'm in bed talking to someone. There's a three-year-old playing with paint and we can't control him. He begins to smear the paint all over the hats. I am heartbroken. It has ruined the hats. We're going to see the brother of the old woman who lives in a nearby village. On the strip. We arrive in the village. I'm told that curiosity kills the cat. So try to uninvite it. His elderly wife invites me in.
