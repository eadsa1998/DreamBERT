       (Same place, yes?) Sue is interviewing someone on cable TV, and members of the LT community are doing the support jobs, doing the camera, etc. - I'm asked to take over when someone else needs to leave, he or she's just put the camera down and I'm not sure what to do with it. It's actually very like a shotgun mike, it has a conical end on it and you just sort of hold it out there, but I'm having lots of trouble keeping it steady and I can't tell what I'm actually "hitting" with it. I'm picturing this whole interview being shown from side to side and pictures of their feet. Finally when I think it's stable they get up to end the interview and move. And I don't know how to shut it off, either.
