Late for Church: upstairs in a loft, hear bell of consecration and pray for forgiveness. There are some birds caught in a "fuse box." Father Andrew comes up from the altar in his robes and frees the trapped bird. He is very patient and gentle; I have to hold another struggling bird. Then go down to Church and arrive in time for kneeling at special service: dialogue in German. Bishops are there baptizing Father Andrew with clear water in front of whole congregation; I hear words clearly spoken in German and I comment that Father Andrew has such a good German accent. I see him leave by special exit then see children, Wendy and Nevena playing...
