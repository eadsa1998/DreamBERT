I was at home but it was different. Mom had bought heaps of these thick red socks. Leslie and Valerie had taken a few. Dad had been seeing this girl and he said she might come over asking for money and I was to tell her to go away. She worked at this place which sold epilepsy pills and was a drug addict. She pulled up on a motorbike and Mom turned off the outside light. She came to the door and Mom refused her money and she said "of course not" and left. She was actually super crazy. Later I was staying at Dad's. I watched some Alain Delon movie from the 1980s and he was old. It was a weird horror film. We fell asleep and I woke up to the video player opening and I looked up and saw someone outside wearing "superhero clothes" and then ran off. I saw the door unlocked and open. Dad locked it and shut the curtains. Later, Mom and Ezra were there too. This bench top had a weird texture and she wanted it. She sent us a video.
