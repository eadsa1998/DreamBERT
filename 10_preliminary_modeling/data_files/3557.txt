Theresa/Cherokee is driving a pickup and I am the passenger. I see us driving very fast across the canyon to get to the event. We overslept. I see her dark hair very clearly; she is vibrant and pretty. I see my gray hair. Now I arrive with my little girl. We'd been in such a rush we hadn't taken time to eat breakfast or take my pills. I walk, holding the girl in my arms. I find my yellow pill box and take the pills, only the vitamin, the calcium, and the hormones. I put them aside, sort of checking if I had enough to make it through the stay. Now I see the group, singing is over and someone already moved the pickup. I am looking for some breakfast. I choose the left hall and open a door to see a smoke-filled room with an annoyed woman in it. I apologize because I hadn't realized this was now someone's private living quarters. I now go down the hall on the right. I see an Indian woman who gives me $1.10 in tokens as I can't find my purse. I assure her I'll pay her back. She says, "Go to the farmer's wife. She still has breakfast." I say, "Is this enough money?" She smiles at my concern. I find the farmer's wife and am asking the girl what she would like to eat. The girl isn't particularly interested in any of my suggestions.
