I was in my room and there was a big black beetle on my bed, which climbed onto my wall and these little red ones were following it. I sprayed them. Nana and Poppa didn't like something. I found a dream about Dmitri that I didn't write into my book, from the 4/6/06. I was then at this place with some people. It was a school, but it was a bit dodgy. There was a blow-up like playground. I thought something was wrong and there was never food anywhere. There was a cold squishy thing in a hole. Dmitri was there. We were all wandering around and teachers kept asking us which class we had. There was this one dodgy lady teacher who kept turning up. It was lunch time, but we took a long time to sit down to eat. Samantha started eating and then the bell went. We laughed and complained. I asked this girl with chocolate if I could have some. We snuck out of the lunch room to explore. Then we were looking off a ledge and there was a girl, who was Kim (24) but was in another body and Nina Myers (also 24) was also in another body and they were fighting, but Nina had powers. Ezra and I were confused about it. Dmitri was at a table eating. I went and sat next to him, but he was writing or talking about me and told me to move. I didn't know this though and was annoyed. Later we were on an oval place. This guy we were with said my boobs were on a "nice right angle" and said they were like a triangle and this other guy agreed. I folded my arms over so they couldn't see. I think the other guy was Chad Michael Murray.
