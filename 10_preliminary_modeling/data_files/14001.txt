We went to a cemetery after someone in our family died (or someone else). I was with Dad and Ezra and we were carrying the coffin. Eugene and his family were in front of us. He had two sisters and he was wearing his leavers' jacket. One of his sisters had "Seecee" on the back and the other had "Solaris". Eugene said it was either a "Russian movie or a Russian spacecraft". Then we were on an excursion and Eugene was following me. There was a mirror maze and Eugene went off to get changed. Jeremiah and Darius were around in orange jumpers. Across from the mirror maze were some guys fighting on a stage in a weird way and one of them was in a lot of pain. I asked someone if we were supposed to get changed and they said no and I said "Eugene is" and I went through the maze. We then were eating lunch. Jeremiah told Eugene not to sit with me because he thought he had a 'thing' for me. He sat somewhere else. We had to write down a question and I went to get a black and red pen out of my bag, but first I forgot the red pen and grabbed blue instead and then I went back to get the red pen. Last Train to Clarksville was playing. This book of mine wouldn't close, so I just left it open. Evelyn was crawling on the floor to get to a plate. Jeremiah came to the table where I was and asked Alejandro and I what we were eating and I said "vegemite sandwich" and he said "same old, same old" and I wondered how he knew. Then this girl went to this house with a vampire guy. They got separated and she bumped into her brother. Some guys took their car, which was the car from Supernatural. This vampire morphed into this woman. This girl was later outside at this rocky place with a vampire guy. There was a vampire couple in a bed. The girl was pretty and she had brown hair and a red ribbon thing around her neck. Later I was at home and Uncle Wilbur and Poppa were there doing something for me, but I don't remember what. I had to have a shower.
