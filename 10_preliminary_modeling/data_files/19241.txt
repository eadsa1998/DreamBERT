I dreamt that the world would end the next day as the bible predicted it. My family was in the dream along with three of my closest friends. My friends are all the same age as me. I remember trying to say good-bye to my friends and family because I knew we all would die the next day. I can't remember specific settings, but I do remember a field/meadow where all the grass was brown. I was very stressed out throughout the dream.
