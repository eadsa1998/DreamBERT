I dreamt about a room filled with mirrors that made me look thinner than I am. I was wearing a long blue dress. The dress didn't look well on me; it seemed to be hanging from a hanger instead of me. But I wanted the dress to look nice on me, I wanted to be pretty because I had to go to ... I don't even know where I had to go, but I needed to look really nice. I looked at myself in the mirrors again, and I saw myself fatter and fatter. I looked like a pig. I felt so unhappy that I wanted to die, I wanted to leave that place. The dress had come apart at the seams in several places. I called the salesgirl so that she would bring back my clothes. She brought my clothes, but didn't let me out. I started to scream and I started to break the mirrors, but behind each mirror there was another mirror, and I couldn't stop seeing the mirrors. I was tired and I wanted to get out of there and I called my mother. I felt I was 9 years old, and my mother came and took me by the hand. And when I was getting up to go, I fell and started to gyrate, and I fell into a void, I think, or someplace very deep.
