Two men come to take me to the Personality study lab. One is a thickset stranger. I ask with whom I'm to go. We go downstairs and I realize I've not got my autobiography with me. Go back to get it. Can't find it. Perhaps I did bring it down. Go down stairs and find the yellow script in the wastebasket with yellow tally sheets.
