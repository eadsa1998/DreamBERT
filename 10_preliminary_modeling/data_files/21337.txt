I was watching some of the fellows fishing down by the lake. They caught a couple ten pounders. I saw an odd kind of fish. It might have been shrimp. It lay on the ground and the bait was on the ground. The bait made a move and shrimp crawled over to the bait and got on top of it and it was caught. I was painting houses. I painted it seemed a whole row. I just had one side to do. They were in Rivertown. I saw Laternal in the paper the other day as a winner. Now I am not sure whether I saw this in my sleep or I was thinking of it. Anyway, I think I saw him as a winner again.
