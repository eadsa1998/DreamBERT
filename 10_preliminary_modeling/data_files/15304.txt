I was at university in a lecture with a young girl who wasn't really a science person. We left and Rebekah asked us if we would join her. I told her Samantha had already left and I didn't know where Calvin was. I didn't know why she was talking to me. I was outside and I heard Calvin talking. Some girl fell down a hill and slid into a building and was trapped. There was a 4WD next to my car with two guys in it and they reversed but then had to wait for a friend. My brakes were werid. Then Ezra was in the car. We got to a set of lights and this alarm went off. There were red lights and this robot was up in the sky. I put my foot down and drove. It followed me and I kept hiding in various places. It found me and I blew it up. We were going to hotels and on the top of each one and it was like the edge of a cliff. We would jump down and it would blow them up (but not totally). Then it was a movie and a guy went in and asked everyone to hide him and thye refused because of something he did earlier and he said "I didn't know you then!" and they didn't believe him.
