My mom and I were driving to ballet when she suddenly passed out at the steering wheel. I started driving to the hospital and it was amazingly easy. The problem was, I didn't know where the hospital was. Setting: In my neighborhood. Characters: My mom and me. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, worried. I have had this kind of dream before (recently).
