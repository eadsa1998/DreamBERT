A girl came in from the next room from me and woke up my roommate asking her what time it was. Irma said it was quarter after 6 and Barb called her a liar and insisted that it was 6:30. Irma got quite huffy and they started quarreling. Barb slammed the door and stormed into her room. This woke me up. I was very angry at being awakened from a sound sleep in such a rude way. This dream seemed so real that I was actually surprised to find out that it really never happened.
