I'm collaborating with 2 friends (my friend Ralph and my friend Terry) to put on a club night. We have a venue but no records, so we go to various places to borrow records from other people. We visit one DJ. He's not that willing to help, but with some persuasion he's going to give us some. His 'boss' is a hard-nosed woman who tries to put a stop to our night. In the venue there's band equipment set up. Other friends are there: my friend Saul plays drums, my friend Tyler plays bass, I pick up a guitar, and Terry and Ralph pick up microphones. We jam a version of the Kinks song 'All of the day and all of the night'. We are rusty and it doesn't sound good, but we enjoy it. The woman in charge is in the room, and when we finish she pours scorn on us.
