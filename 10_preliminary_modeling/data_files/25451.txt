 My neighbors, Wanda and Luke Stalk, enter my home through the back door and hug my sister Ramona. They are happy because they received college degrees and were in athletics. Luke had a 3.8 grade point average, while Wanda's was a bit lower. It is late at night. My sister Heather is awake. Her baby is in my mom's room. My mom has gone downtown to get something for Heather. Heather is like my 8th grade classmate, Karen Schmitz, in that she has a child at a young age. She is also ratty, nasty, and grouchy: a yak. She wants me to do something, so I go into my mom's room to change the baby's diaper. I don't see the baby at first, and then I do. It is wrapped up, sleeping. It looks like it is in a car seat. I attempt to pick the baby up. It is a big baby: about a year old, long and lanky. It is a boy. It awakens and starts to cry. It's late at night. I eat a huge piece of pink and white cake. I hold it in my hand and it crumbles, pieces fall to the floor. Andrew is mad that I spilled. I am at my friend Matt Yams house. Matt and I are ordering candy from the mail. The candy has four colors, and is in four pieces.
