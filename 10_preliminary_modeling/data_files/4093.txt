["Blind Woman Draws My Picture"]  I see Lucy using charcoal like chalk to draw a picture of me. She's not actually drawing it, but putting in the dark brown colored hair. It looks very professiona;l. She accurately follows the line of the hair on the side of the face. I asm reminded of a drawing  my mother made of Ellie when she was a little girl.
