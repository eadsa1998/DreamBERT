It was olden day western setting. People had southern accents. This guy next door to these people was related to this other guy and wanted to buy out his property. He found out he was selling it and they were arguing. The guy's wife and kid overheard the conversation so he killed them, but the wife was ok so she was sent to some place where she had to dance. I was then there but I needed to pee so I went to the toilet and before I could get my pants down this tall guy came and I said "I'm just going to the toilet, I didn't kill a thing". He said "Didn't kill a thing" and then shot 'me'. Then I was somewhere and they sent us photos of them killing our pets. I only remember seeing Tinkerbell and Spaceman though. I was really upset. Mom, Ezra and I were staying at some place. People from House of 1000 Corpses lived next door. Otis was playing Scrabble. We were going to sleep.
