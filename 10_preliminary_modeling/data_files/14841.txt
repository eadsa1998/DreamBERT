I was in a car on the freeway/highway. There was a flashing light up ahead and we realized there had been an accident. We were annoyed at having to wait in traffic, but when we passed it, there was a person hanging out of the car with a smashed head. Later, I was in a bed with an old woman. I got up and when I came back the wall had collapsed on her head. I took a photo and then I called 000 and said "I need an ambulance" and I told them what happened but they didn't seem interested. I had seen a photo of this happening before.
