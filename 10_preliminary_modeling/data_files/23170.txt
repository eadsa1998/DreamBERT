Gilda Folert called, and I answered the phone.  She said she was coming over soon, and that she and my son Burt were getting married.  I was dismayed, and asked Burt if it was true, and he said it was.  I asked him how and when he was going to tell Kelly, who was asleep.  I don't remember what he said.
