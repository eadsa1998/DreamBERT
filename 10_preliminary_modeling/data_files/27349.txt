My boyfriend (23) had asked me to marry him and I had said that I would, although I didn't want to do so, and had no intention of going through with it. I kept hoping that something would happen so that I wouldn't have to marry him. But nothing did, and the day of the wedding finally arrived. I was frantic because no arrangements had been made. I went dashing around in a long white dress and a veil inviting people to the wedding. Then I was inside the building where the ceremony was to take place. I didn't know what to do, but I was determined not to marry him, so I pretended to faint.
