I was in Jackson and I was with Grammy, and I don't know if Mom was there or not, but I was sleeping in a bed and it was morning time and she was vacuuming and she just opened my door and brought this vacuum cleaner in and it was so loud, and, of course, I didn't like the fact that she woke me up. So I tried to say something, but my voice couldn't be heard above the sound, so I got up and I was like waving her back with my hand and by the time she moved on to the next room, I wanted to make my point. So I hurried up and ran in the next room and was trying to show with my body how frustrated I was. And then the next thing was, there was a school that apparently -- I'm trying to think of the word -- I think it was called Writers L_____ University. And it wasn't a regular university, but it also had this other wing that was for young people, and it was kind of like Interlochen (?) in that it was for really talented arts people. And I don't know how I got there. I wasn't actually enrolled, but I was walking in the ________ and _____________ walk into some of the classrooms, and in one of them they were doing like animated projects and things. And this one girl had rigged a piano, like a prepared piano, except it was with electronic sampling, and she had this box full of CD's and she said they would allow her to play her favorite '90's songs. And the one she demonstrated for us was "Paints" (?) ______________ grown up in our family portrait we were pretty happy, let's go back to that. So the CD played like the background accompaniment and then she played the foreground sound, like on a regular like keyboard patch. And everybody was kind of like, "Oh, I ____________, this isn't really anything very beautiful. Anybody could do that." And there some other things; I can't remember exactly what they were. But I think for some reason there was a fire drill, I think. I don't really remember it that well. I don't remember rushing to leave the building. I just remember feeling pretty lost when I came back in. And everybody was kind of thinking that I was not following the right procedures. I don't go in the right line or I didn't do the right check-in or I didn't make the right handshake or something, and I felt like, I kind of felt like I was sort of pseudo enrolled ______ first day, and I was like, "Well, I wish I would have known what the correct procedure to follow was." And so apparently you had this paper that you overlaid over a calendar and you to cut out a little opening over the dates where this happened so that you could show that you were there for that day. I don't know of anything crazier. And then next the really bad part was that -- oh, and before I go to that, in this school one time I was walking down the hall and Garrison K________ was there reading one of his books and giving a lecture, and he was out in the hall and there were several students around him. So I went to go and listen to him for a while and then I kind of faded away after a while. Then I dreamt that I think I was in Jackson or something, and something really awful had happened to me and I was laying there with Mom kind of trying to discuss it. And I didn't remember it actually happening, but I remember kind of feeling intuitively like it did happen. And I was saying to Mom, "Well, if it was real, then why don't I remember it?" And she was saying, "Well, if it was so horrible you repressed it." And she was saying, "We need to get you to a doctor and get you checked out" and stuff like that. I was feeling kind of really funny about the whole thing, and I was crying in the dream, but there were no tears per se. And it took me a long time to just get kind of calmed down and all that sort of thing. I don't know where in the world such a bizarre thing could have come from. And I'm trying to think if that was the last thing that happened before I woke up, because when I woke up, I was so relieved that none of it was real. And there was one other thing that happened along the way. I was in the church and I was diddling around playing their organ and their choir was kind of warming up, and I thought that I could just sort of hang around, and then -- oh, and I was looking at a picture that was hanging from the music desk where they had tied it on. And was like a picture of a saint or somebody, but I couldn't figure out who it was. And then somebody leaned over and said, "Hey, we're about to start. This isn't polite to be doing this when we're about to start." And I said, "Well, okay, I'll ______ your instrument and leave." And that's all I can remember.
