I was wandering through the rooms of a mansion. There were all these exquisitely decorated secret rooms. This one room I found had a four-poster bed with a white lace comforter and canopy. There was a fireplace and a Jacuzzi in the middle of the room. Then I found myself sleeping in a sleeping bag on the floor in a garage. A woman had come in and woke me up. She was angry. She said, "What are you doing in my house?" Then Julie came in and told her that it was OK, that I had her permission.
