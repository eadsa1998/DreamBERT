This is the first time in a long time that I've actually been able to wake up and remember the dream that I had. They've been slipping away from me as soon as I gain consciousness for some reason. But the other night I had a dream that I was at this run-down house -- kind of like Aunt Kristin's house -- and we heard this band playing. And Christina and I were walking around, and we were going to try to record this thing, and it was playing in one of those portable classroom-like things. And we were walking around to get the best vantage point because she wanted to record it. And we even stepped inside and realized that it was much quieter in there, because their amplifier was, they had the wires like under the door and everything outside so that we could hear them. And it looked just like Mom's vacuum cleaner, only without the hose. [laugh] And then I was listening to a tape that was supposed to have some oldies on it, but instead it had some bluebird songs and some oldies. And I dreamt that Christina and I -- it was dark by then -- we were walking and she gave me three numbers. One was 898-2956, the usual one. The other one was one that she had gotten for her birthday, but she got it taken away because she violated her curfew. And then the third one was another one that she got.
