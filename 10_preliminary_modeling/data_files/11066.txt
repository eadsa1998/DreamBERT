My dream took place in two houses, my own home and the home of my boyfriend's sister-in-law. I was married to my uncle, someone other than the person I am engaged to now. The doorbell rang at my home and a little boy asked me to come over to my boyfriend's sister-in-law, that there was a package for me from someone other than my husband. So I did. When I arrived at the sister-in-law's home, she had opened the box. She said, "Look, isn't it beautiful?" I didn't look. I merely took the whole box and went home. When I got home, I threw the box into a corner and then my husband arrived home and shortly after this the other boy's parents came over and said, "How could you marry someone else when you knew Whitney was coming home?" Then they left the room. I never looked at the box and I wondered what was in it, and how I married my uncle. The dream ended here.
