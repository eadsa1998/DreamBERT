I was at the CAS office. Bill C was sitting on the other side of my desk talking to me about something. He was leaning way over, with his arms or elbows resting on the desk. Apparently it had been a somewhat tense discussion, or we were discussing something we disagreed on. When he finished he held out his hand and said something like, What? No handshake? I shook his extended hand and then lightly patted, three times, the hand that was resting flat on the desk. He smiled and commented about the pat being an extra, meaning something I don't normally do. We are now lying side by side, he on his back and I on my left side facing him. I have my head resting on his shoulder and my right hand resting on his chest. Actually I keep moving my hand between his chest and stomach. He gets up and leaves for a few minutes and then comes back. Now I am lying to his left, on my right side, and place my left hand on his chest. He brings his head down a bit and gently kisses me. This isn't anything romantic. There was something about Jane, maybe we were at the office and she was in another room. Yet, us lying together in this way was perfectly fine - partially because it wasn't romantic and partially because it was a natural expression of some aspect of our relationship.
