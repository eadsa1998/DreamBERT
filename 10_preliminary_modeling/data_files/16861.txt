I'm the ring leader of a gang of young people - ages ranging from about 9 to 20-somethings. Perhaps I'm younger in this dream, also in my 20's. My brother is in the gang, along with his ex-girlfriend Jane and her younger brother, who have run away from their parent's house. We get up to mischief for a weekend, snooping around people's dark houses at night, picking up things to play with like torches. We take (or borrow) some things from Jane's house and all return to our 'den' which is a shed or a basement. Jane's father is after us. He tries to track us down. Eventually we are at my childhood home, sitting in the kitchen. Due to the lighting conditions we can see out, but he cannot see in.  He looks furious. He knocks at the door. He looks a bit like my next door neighbor. We all ermine quiet. He turns to go, but stops and then suddenly turns and puts his face right up to the kitchen window with cupped hands - and he sees all of us. I decide to step in (to prevent a situation where he goes to the police etc), so I go to the front door, and invite him in, and apologize to him. We promise to return all his things, and his kids apologize too. Then there is some kind of wedding party and all the characters are there. It may be my brother's wedding to Jane. There is still a lot of tension from the father, but his wife has totally forgiven us and is getting drunk and gushy. It's very weird.
