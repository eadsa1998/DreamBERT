I was riding in a cable car. I was carrying a pair of eyeglasses and a camera. The camera was in a case with straps. I had a hard time holding onto them. I passed a woman going in a car in the opposite direction. I recognized her as a woman who had worked at a printing company where I had been employed at one time.
