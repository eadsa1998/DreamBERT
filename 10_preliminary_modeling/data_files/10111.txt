At a CONCERT with Hillary; we were late because she had to get the children settled; Just as we are relaxing listening to good music, Hillary gets very anxious about her children, and runs out of the hall "like stung by a bee." She finds them playing happily, but puts them in a wheelbarrow and brings them into the concert hall.... I get so angry I can hardly talk and hiss at her. (but I don't break off our friendship).
