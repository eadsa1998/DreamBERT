I had to go to some weird guy's house to straighten my hair. He was like senile and today it was causing the hair straightener to be too dangerous to use. I was going to call Mom and tell her to get me a new one. Dad was around somewhere. I couldn't remember where this guy lived. Someone was taking oranges from a basket, to use for baked beans on toast? Dad wouldn't tell me where the guy lived. I was watching Skins. Sid was in class and he had this way to wake himself up from vivid daydreams. This girl took her math book to the teacher and said she did all the questions and she had told her to do and there were no problems. Sid said "Yeah I heard you loud enough; you're not the only person alive". He asked the teacher if she'd noticed he was failing (and why not help him instead). She basically said there was no hope for him. Also before some time, I was in communications. I got 54% in my essay, which was like 25 marks, but I did pass. Ms Ingram was there.
