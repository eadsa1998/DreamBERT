Ezra had this thing which would make peoples legs go out to the side and their heart would burst. It didn't affect him though and I didn't want it to affect me. So I backed away, but Ezra followed saying it would only affect people far away and then I argued that people over the other side of the world weren't getting affected. I didn't get a reply though.
