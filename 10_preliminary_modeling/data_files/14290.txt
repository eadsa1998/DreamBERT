I was in a building and then a Rottweiler was outside and was trying to get in. Mom decided to let it in, thinking that would cause less damage. I climbed up this ladder thing to go to a higher floor, but it just went to this small cage thing on a platform. I went back down and onto a desk. The dog ran up the steps and we tried to catch it, but the cage was too small. It turned out it was half human or something
