This dream took place near a creek beside a highway in Dover, Ohio. Frank, an old high school friend, and I were working with some construction outfit along this highway. My friend is 23 years old. There was a creek running alongside the highway, and the only thing I can remember is going over to this creek about every five minutes to get a drink of water. The first couple of times I used my hands to scoop up the water, but later I used an old rusty can that I found by the creek.
