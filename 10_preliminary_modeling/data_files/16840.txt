I'm in a minibus with several members of my extended family - my mother, aunts, cousins and their children and my eldest daughter. We stop at a shopping centre and everyone gets out. There's some confusion about who is going to the shops and who is staying in the van. my eldest daughter is on the pavement with some of her cousins. I'm putting on a pair of trainers, but I can only find one shoe. I have 2 or 3 pairs, so I search for a matching pair. While I'm doing this, I assume my daughter is being looked after, but apparently no one knows where she is. When I realize that she is missing I rush into the shops and frantically search for her. I partly blame myself, and partly blame my cousins. It's a terrible dream.
