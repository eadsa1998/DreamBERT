I was at Nana's. I was walking around to go through Poppers's door. I saw a goose, it hissed, so I ran and it chased me. I had to jump over the ramp to down and I got stuck at the fish pond and it got me. It was pecking me and then heaps of others started to. Poppa and others tried to get them off but they couldn't. They had to kill them and I closed my eyes. They were then sinking in the fish pond. They got the rest off me and my leg hurt and I tried to run to the door. Someone said I'd never be able to run again. I went out later and I saw goose walking around so I ran back in.
