In this dream the dreamer was climbing a mountain which he had been told in actual life that the particular mountain couldn't be climbed. Dreamer is actually afraid of high places, yet in the dream he is climbing a perpendicular precipice and for the first time in the climb he becomes terrified. In the dream the subject knows there is a cave immediately above him so he climbs into the cave where he rests and regains courage. The dreamer resumes his climb then his fear returns and he returns to the cave. This episode of leaving and returning to the cave recurs several times in the dream until finally the subject resolves to climb to the top. In the course of the climb said subject slips, starts to fall through space and then awakens.
