I was watching Big Brother UK. I was telling Dad about a couple in there who pretended that the female half was pregnant. They got Kylie Minogue in there. She was in there for a while when she got called to the diary room, but had to go through this other room which was full of obstacles and tunnels. David Tennant helped her escape and she ran. Hugh Laurie got up and said something, but she was gone. There were lots of blocks. Then she got back and Big Brother said that she was allowed to stay in the house. People were having an argument. David Tennant was there and he said "Look, calm down" and saw everyone looking at him, so to take the attention away from himself, he said something about Georgie, a contestant in the show and also the guy from Summerstorm. A lady in the house got a laptop so she could write a diary. Then it was my laptop. I had to say that I wouldn't use it to meet or annoy "Michael Robert Downey" and it was actually Michael Palin, but it said Downey for some reason. It kept changing colour based on what I was thinking. It went green, orange, light blue and black.
