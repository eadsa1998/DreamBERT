Mom and I were at these rows of phones, and this guy was putting the phones everywhere. The phones didn't work; pay phones. We saw this bus. We ran up a hill to catch it but the bus was already going down the hill. I was waving my arms, but it didn't stop. So we went into this building, and we went into this elevator kind of thing. It wouldn't let us out. This was a little scary. This thing's voice said it would see our emotions. Then we went through this thing. Then we were outside and we were watching something. These people were smashing bottles. These police came out. One guy said, "Don't step on that." The policeman stepped on it. There was a pile of glass. He yelled, and they carried him away. It was kind of funny to me because I didn't see any blood.
