I was working in some kind of a document. It had tables. I was transferring text from one table into another. The second table was much wider than the first. As I was transferring the text I was reformatting it to fit the size of the wider table. I was doing it one cell at a time. I finally figured out a way. There were four different sets of tables. I finally figured out a way that I could transfer all of the text from one table into the new one for each set at one time instead of doing it a cell at a time. I was feeling good that it was done and that I had found this way to do the whole thing at once for each set. But then I found out that it wasn't right and I got really aggravated.
