I was up in the clouds and I could see the whole city. I saw how the people moved hurriedly. It was a very frantic world. The very tall buildings seemed to be ants' nests. People went in and out, they ran, fell down. It seemed they were very upset. Suddenly I came down from the clouds and everything seemed different because there was absolute silence.
