I see Nate. He smiles and comes over to me. I can see he is going to kiss me. I say, "No," as he bends me over in a romantic dip. He smiles and kisses me anyway. It is pleasant. I pull away and say, "I have work to do. Now go away. That was a cafe kiss." He grins and says, "If that's a goodbye kiss, then I can't wait to say hello!"
