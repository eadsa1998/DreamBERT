I was at school. I was in a classroom and the siren was about to go. The teacher was talking and the class was full but I started walking out. I had to walk past Eugene. I was then at this house with Ezra. It was creepy. The reception was really bad and I kept getting texts from 'Poo'. They were like "na est lie pa", which really creeped me out. I showed Ezra. I said they were from Calvin's other phone. We watched this video of this person walking past a hallway and it scared us. They tried to get in the house. I was friends with Eugene's group and I needed Darius for something.
