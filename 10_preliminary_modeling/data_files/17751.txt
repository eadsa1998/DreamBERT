Aliens were attacking; it was a 'repeat dream'.  My boyfriend Jeremy and I were aliens, too, I think.  Not human, necessarily, but a different species than the attackers.  We were doing what we could to fight off the offense.  There was a yellow catwalk, and we were trying to cross it like monkey bars, hanging below.  I looked out to the sky where the sun was setting.  I saw a flat rectangular ship flying in sideways.  Behind it there was an explosion and smoke.  We started to lose all hope, and it was the end of existence for our species, so I wanted to have sex with Jeremy.  We were in a small room.  My mother's bowling teammate Glenda came in, and wanted to go to sleep, so she curled up on the bed.  Someone else was with us and came up with one last idea to try.  So Jeremy and I went to work to save the other remaining inhabitants, baby cartoonish-looking slugs.  Glenda woke up and was some sort of superhero, wearing black and purple, flying about the room.
