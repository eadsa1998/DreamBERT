I had a really bad dream last night. I was back at my high school and trying to go to the gym. For some reason all the teachers and a lot of the students hated me and thought I was a bitch. I couldn't understand why, but it felt horrible for everyone to dislike me so much. I think I finally did make it to the gym, and everyone there was really rude to and mad at me because I was wearing my tennis skirt, and I guess that was offensive. It was a silly dream, but it felt awful to be disliked, and I wanted to go back and rewrite whatever it was I had done to become so unpopular.
