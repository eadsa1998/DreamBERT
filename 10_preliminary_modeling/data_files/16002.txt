Something had happened and we needed to get away and hide. I was with Frederick and Tristan. We were packing some stuff into a car and Tristan said we'd have to change our identities and go somewhere else. I was annoyed at this. At some point, I thought it was a dream. I tested this by telling Frederick to do something instead of asking him and he did it without complaint. We sat in the backseat and he kept touching my feet with his feet and poking me. I decided I wanted to have sex with him and was trying to think of a way to leave where we were and go off somewhere but then I woke up.
