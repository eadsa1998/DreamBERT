I take two male roommates to help with expenses. They put a sign over the door saying something like The Boys of Love or something. They see two young women they are interested in moving their furniture out in the hall and run out to ask if they are leaving the building. The women say no, they are moving to an apartment upstairs because it is cheaper. The boys are relieved. Now we go back into my apartment, which we are remodeling. They have taken up the carpet and rolled it up and put it in the hall. I see the floor and wonder if I made a mistake because the floor is very ugly and I will have to re-carpet the place, which will be expensive. Now I am showing the place to Paulina and Clarice (Paulina's daughter). I point out there are five different areas that represent five different characters. I see lots of early American wood stuff and decide I don't like that style. I see a picture of a woman in black and white and remember showing the same picture to Clarice when it was in full color. It is a large wall portrait of a woman standing. I go back out of this end area. Paulina says, "Here at least it looks like you," meaning the furniture and accessories are mine. I smile and say yes. Now I see Millie talking to another young woman relative. She then looks at a wood carved statue of several people in a canoe and I am explaining how sad the one woman figure is. She can't seem to see it. I try several times to point it out to her. Naomi asks something. I say, "Oh, yes, books all over, but this section the books aren't mine. They belong to one of the characters. I can't even find a book on those shelves I care to read."
