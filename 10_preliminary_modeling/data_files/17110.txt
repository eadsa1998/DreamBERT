I dreamt once again of bees, and also vampires.  In the beginning, I was a vampire too.  The others were trying to kill me, though, so I had to run.  At the beginning it was said that the objects we'd found were fish eggs.  I guess I'd made a correction, though in the third person.  I had to move to brush one of the bees off my neck.  I found myself trapped by the vampires on the stairs.  I climbed onto the railing so as to appear to be jumping off rather than going further up and remaining trapped.  Then I made my way all the way up.  It bought a little time, and I was no longer alone.
