["Bill Clinton and me."] I am at a White House function, in my power wheelchair. Bill Clinton is attracted to me. He flirts and chats. He wonders what it's like to be in a power wheelchair and I get out of mine and choose another chair, which is like a walker with wheels and a chair seat. It is black. He drives around, bumping into things. I laugh and say put it on slow because you'll really scrape up all this lovely furniture. Then I wheel slowly around in my "manual" chair. Now we are seated at a dining table, other guests and staff are there. He had placed a package at my place. I open the soft tissue paper wrapping and find a beautiful gold filigree worked necklace with Jade stones on it. Also several rings with jade stones on them. I start to try on the ring on my left hand, wedding ring finger and feel embarrassed he saw that. I change it to the right hand. One fits on my pinky and another on my big finger. I however give him back the necklace saying I can not accept it. He is hurt and asks if I don't like it. I say it's beautiful but it is too much. You and I can't have a relationship and this is so public.
