 I'm ice fishing on Many Fish Lake with my roommate Stephen Ramos. We are spearing in shallow water. I am in a spearing house. It may be my friend Kevin Simpson's ice-fishing house. I am trying to make a hole in the ice. I succeed after removing the wood cover to the floor of the house. The water is dirty, and difficult to see in it. I see a small northern pike go by, and I throw a piece of wood at it. My classmate Scott Botwright and one of his roommates stop by. It is dark. We are coming back tomorrow to fish. I crawl on the ice over a hole and get wet.
