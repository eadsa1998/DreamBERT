We have just moved into a new house and are putting things in order. I am on the second floor, trying to hang clothes in a closet, but there are no clothes hangers. Mary is downstairs organizing things. I'm amazed at how healthy she is. She had been sick but is now OK and busily getting things done. Mary accepts my offer to help her, but I just can't seem to get started. I am confused. I don't know what to do first - to shave or to shower. I don't know where to find the items I'll need for either task. I go downstairs to see how I can help Mary. She has just taken out an enormously large loaf of bread. It is so huge it has to be cut in two to fit onto the table.  Mary, pleasantly, chides me for being so slow in getting around to help her. All I can think about is how well and healthy she looks when only yesterday she had been too sick to get out of bed or to do anything. I am delighted, surprised and happy at her return to good health. But I'm also puzzled because I can't understand how her health improved so much in so short a time. All this while, I'm trying to get organized. I want to help Mary but have great difficulty getting started. I am trying to find clothes hangers and trying to figure out how to get washed, shaved, dressed, etc.
