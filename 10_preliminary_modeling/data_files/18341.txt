I am out in Topeka talking to the psychologist Gardner Murphy. I don't recall exactly the topics of conversation, but it generally was concerning fellowships and career opportunities and things like that. In the last parts of our conversation we seem to go over the same parts over and over. Finally it's time for coffee hour and he goes off to coffee hour and I am going to follow him down in a couple of minutes after I go to the bathroom, which I do. Incidentally, his office in my dream doesn't look the way his office really looks. I want to have 5 more minutes with him to summarize all the various things we talked about and somehow instead of making it to the coffee hour, we go to his home. That's about all I recall of that dream.
