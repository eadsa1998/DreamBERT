Hunting for dominoes and filling their box. Then while we waited for our guests I went several times to the other door to see if they weren't ready. At last R was at the door and asked if we were ready. We told her we were and just waiting for them. She said Molly and Jo weren't coming and Kath was too tired. As I started to eat, I noticed I needed a saladfork and found someone had put forks around while I was gone.
