The sun shines in my eyes so I change from the small rocker to the large armchair. I continue correcting the paper but I have only the first sheet so I go to the office for the rest. No one is there so after awhile I pick up and hunt through a pile of papers. They are in alphabetical order but backwards. I find a King but not a King Knip. Quite provoked at the waste of time. At last hear him coming with some other man. Before finding the paper he tells them, "Wist said there was two ways in which I was better than any of the other teachers. The first I couldn't hear. She whizzes right through things."
