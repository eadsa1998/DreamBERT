I am at Grandma Mildred's funeral. Someone is explaining the story of my book about Maudie. She says good (Mildred) and I say, "Oh I don't know, maybe I'll write you naked and dancing!" She is on her back and says, "It would make me crawl in my grave." I see her moving. There is a strong sense of camaraderie and teasing. She seems pleased that I wrote the book.
