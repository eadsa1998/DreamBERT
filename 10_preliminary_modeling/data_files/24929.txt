The Starship Voyager had a large delegation from a strange planet. Be'lanna Torres was working with the son of the leaders. She says she wants to show him something while they're in engineering. She beckons him behind a tree into a garden; he is confused. She takes two willow branches off a tree and I get the feeling she is about to start the Klingon mating ritual. The next thing I know I am in a bedroom. The son is in a bed with his grandma (I guess there wasn't enough room). Be'lanna was standing next to the bed. Also the whole alien delegation is in there and everyone is wearing ceremonial robes, even Be'lanna and the people in bed. Then either Be'lanna or the son said to each other they had a lot of fun last night. The leaders looked very disapproving and the guards started to spin their spears. Setting: Starship Voyager - first in engineering, then in an inside garden, and then in a bedroom. Characters: Be'lanna and an alien delegation that consisted of the royal family and some guards. (The son of a delegate, and his grandmother.) Feelings and Thoughts: Disappointed. I was disappointed in Be'lanna's behavior.
