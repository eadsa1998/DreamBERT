["Meeting a man."] I am dressing up to go to a single's group. We are seated by age so we will be around others of our own age. I think I look presentable and enter the room. I tell them I am 57 years old. I sit down. A man is seated in the row behind me. The announcer says to connect with someone near you. He leans his head near mine. I decide to chance it and lean back so that our heads touch. He is very happy. Now he is holding my hand and we are seated next to each other. His arm and hand are very muscled and strong. It feels reassuring and good. Apparently he's decided we are a couple. I think this might work out, so I go along with it. Then a woman comes in, someone I'd been angry with because of her behavior. She ruined a project I was in once. I see her and decide to forgive her. The man is very pleased and impressed with my good attitude. She and I begin talking of some video projects she has going. She says a video for school children. I say great. That would be fun. She says the M City Fire department is going to do a video for the school children. I could be in that one. I agree, saying I have a great niece and nephew in M City.
