It was about my OB class and involved the three sisters from the TV program Charmed. There was only one image. It was a piece of paper with a table on it that had six cells. It was two columns and three rows. The cells in the left column were square. The cells in the right column were long rectangles. There were two or three pieces of information in each of the rectangles. Each of the items in each of the rectangles were labeled a, b, and c. The sisters were putting the information in each of these rows. When it wasn't right they had to try again. They kept trying to get it right, using witchcraft. It's as though I was there just waiting for them to figure it out and get it right so I could use it. Right before I woke up they had just one more rectangle to get right. There was a sense of urgency. We were running out of time and they had to get it right quickly.
