Dad and I went to a shop thing and he ordered two Kitkats each, but they gave us two altogether. We went to a stationery shop and there were no notebooks left. We ended up at Raquel's and she had a different mother and brother (who was young, fat and big with curly orange hair). At one point, I said he was 'gay and stupid' and his mother yelled at me for using the word 'gay'. I said 'it's just a word' and she carried on and I said 'in this generation, it is not insulting and homophobic, it's a word. It's people like you that make it homophobic' etc. Then she told me 'get out of my house'. There was a fridge outside and I had to get 5-6 trays of cakes and things. I took them back to the car but they were empty -- they had fallen onto the grass, so I just left. Abed (Community) was with us and he told me to turn in to a carpark and then go to this deli place. I went in with Dad and asked if I should get a new Kitkat. There was a phone near the door and I said 'is this Ian's [Community]?' and Dad said yes, that he used it to bill him as a joke. I replied to something on Facebook from my phone and it said 'from Steve'. I left and Abed came back from where he went.
