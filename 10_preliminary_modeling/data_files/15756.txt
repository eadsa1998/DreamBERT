I was still at university. I went to some chemistry based class and sat down. Marvin came in and saw me and then I was worried because I'd told him I wasn't studying anymore but then I couldn't remember who I'd said that to and I thought it was odd since he went to State University. I think there had been a zombie apocalypse thing. Some others and I were in this school building which was quite dark, but it was still early evening outside. We started going down into this store room thing when someone told us to get out. In the shadows were these maggot/worm looking things (they weren't solid, they were like a lighter part of the shadow) and they were called the Unsleep - the only thing that killed them was sunlight. We had left the door open and the shadow started pouring in with them in it, and we threw stuff and shone a torch on it but nothing happened. Then the clouds moved from the sun and the sun shone in and the whole shadow disappeared. I quickly shut the door, but one was left out. The sun had gone away though. Someone said we should leave now. We didn't really know where to go, because we didn't know where the Unsleep had already infected. We drove around looking for somewhere to go. I found a few 'weapons' that would kill the Unsleep, one needed pineapple juice and like nails or something. We already had a pineapple, so we were looking for other bits. Eventually we made one (it was like a gun), but then we found this military base type of thing which was all lit up with fake sunlight.
