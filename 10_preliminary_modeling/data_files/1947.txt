I am with Howard. We've been married a long time but we don't have sex. He's very frustrated. I feel sorry for him, but I just don't want to with him. I get up, thinking it's morning, but it's 5:20 a.m. and still dark outside. I am organizing some old papers and books. He gets up and goes sadly into another bedroom.
