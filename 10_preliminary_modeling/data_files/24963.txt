 I'm on a basketball court. It is similar to the field house at Brimson. I'm warming up with my team. I can't dunk the basketball. There is one kid, I think from Rival High School, who dunks easily. I should be able to also, but when I go up to dunk I just don't get high enough, and end up laying it in, or even missing the lay-up and going for the put-back. <br/
