A boy named Charles Brown was living secretly in our garage. No one knew he was there &amp; he didn't know that we knew, but we wanted to protect him. A letter for him came to the house and I slipped it under the garage door. It turned out to be new license plates. A colored man came up the driveway while I was standing on the back porch with a girl friend. I pushed her into the house and I too went in and tried to lock the door. It was very difficult, but I finally got it locked. Then I saw a boy I had dated for a long time and whom I had considered marrying. He is now married. He was wearing a very gaudy suit, but it was beautifully tailored. He told me that he was still in love with me before he got married, and in my dream he told me to forget what he had said and that he was really happily married. A younger sister of a M--- acquaintance came into my room and jumped up and down on my toes. I turned her over my knees and spanked her. I went shopping with a girl I dislike. She wanted a mouton coat. They showed her one, and I said, "That's not an imitation beaver. That's an imitation Persian." I was to meet my mother and a girlfriend at the H---. My mother--who doesn't smoke--came into the lobby smoking from a long cigarette holder.
