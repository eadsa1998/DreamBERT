I am standing in yard next to hedge on east side of house. There is a pile of clothes on ground just ahead of where I stand. I wish to change trousers, but feel I can't do so because of the presence of a man and a lady in a large, black coupe parked on wrong side of street (i.e., heading north) near corner. Just around corner to left the oldest Carter boy's car is parked, and across the street from it are 3 other parked cars. All 4 cars on Hill Road are empty, the people having left them to inspect several new houses nearby. The lady in the black coupe is sitting on the left side, with her large, white, round (rather pudgy) arm resting on top of door. She seems to be dressed in black. She and her companion are on the point of getting out of the car 2 or 3 times, and I am impatient for them to do so in order that I may get on with my dressing. Finally the pair step out, and now the lady is seen to wear a pink, flowered dress. She said, "Wonder if this is Langdon?" He answered, "No, Langdon is at end of (?Franklin, Hamlin) street."
