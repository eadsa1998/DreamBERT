 I'm with my brother Wally and maybe his friend Myrle Madden. We seem to be in the basement at home in Oak Valley. I realize my sideburns have been cut off, and my goatee is gone! Either I have shaved them when I was really drunk and don't remember, or someone else has cut them off without my knowing! I'm upset. I really wanted to have good length, full sideburns, even if trimmed. Whoever cut them off shaved off too much the bottom for me to trim them while still leaving them all along the side of my face. I'm annoyed, sad, and disappointed.
