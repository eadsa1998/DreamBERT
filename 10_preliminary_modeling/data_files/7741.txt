I was somehow involved in the care of children. We all lived in this mansion. My bedroom had no window. Niles from the TV show The Nanny was there. I saw him in his room dancing. The only thing he was wearing was a pair of black lace, thigh length, tight, underwear. Later we were playing baseball with the children. I let one of the little children have all of my turns.
