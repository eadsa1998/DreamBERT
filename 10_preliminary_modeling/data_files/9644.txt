I am riding on a bus to someone's wedding: DON'T KNOW WHERE WE ARE... or where we are going. I see beautiful scenery: I ask the bus driver where I could use a phone: he says: "Here." I look at him and say, "You look like my analyst." Then I trudge through the snow to find a phone; I cannot find it. I cannot remember what day it is.
