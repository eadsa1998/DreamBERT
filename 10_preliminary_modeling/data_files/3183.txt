I am sort of a stepmother to this man's children and they are horribly mean. They overpower me and tie me up and knock me out and drag me down a trail toward the mountains. They are running away and taking me with them. I wake up and pretend to be unconscious until I get my bearings. I am dragged like I was on a travois, my arms trussed up and my head bouncing against the nearly grown son's butt. I try to escape, now tied to a horse. I run and run. The feeling is I won't escape long. They are evil children.
