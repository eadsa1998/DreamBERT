I had a dream that made me feel like I was cheating on Clayton. I was sitting in a chairlift going downhill, backwards. It was dark and warm all around me, even though I think I knew it should have been cold and snowy. Kit was sitting next to me, his arm around me, and his five o'clock shadow rubbing against my cheek as he nuzzled me. I felt my entire body tensing, gathering energy, pulsing and warm. I squeezed his knee with my right hand; I have a distinct memory of digging my nails into his thigh to release the pressure. The tension was building and I just waited for everything to snap. The dark began to dissolve around a tiny yellow light that brightened in front of me. The light grew and shrank, grew and shrank, grew and shrank until it overwhelmed the darkness, and I was twisting and squirming and grabbing his leg and having an orgasm. And when I woke up I felt like I had cheated on Clayton.
