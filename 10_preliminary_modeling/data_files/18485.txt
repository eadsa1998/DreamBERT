I was suppose to go along the fence backwards until I got it down good and was on a horse but nobody showed up to meet me. Instead I wondered if the cows were angry that I didn't make an appointment. I just showed up. There was a family and I was the little boy and on Saturdays we had to line up and get a big plastic cup and have it filled with sulfuric acid. Then we had to stick our hand in the acid (my right hand) and scrub--hard. I had to scrub the 4 sides of the light post. It was trapezoid in shape. Me and Rudy were suppose to wash clothes and the washing machine was in the kitchen. It was going CHA-CHUNK, cha-chunk; CHA-CHUNK, cha-chunk; but no water was coming in. It was just mixing up the clothes like a blender. We kept throwing in more soap powder and even liquid detergent but to no avail. My mother was in the back room and she could hear us and we knew we were in BIG TROUBLE. There was an underwater cave murder. There was a pocket of air in the underwater cave and 3 guys were there. One was the culprit, one was the victim, and one was the survivor. The victim knew the end was coming and he became very calm. I saw his friend in the Duane Reade. He told me, "I talked to him." "He was very calm." I said. On top of the water I was doing a BIBLE CRUISE. I had to collect 5 gallons of holy water (for my mother) and then I wanted to mail it to her so I wouldn't have to carry it all the way through my travels with the Children of Israel. I got a 5-gallon box to mail it, but then I left if floating on a raft in the Sea of Galilee. I said, "I like floating docks." There was a news conference fashion parade with fashion tid-bits being spewed from a head atop a limo. The head with blonde hair was the size of a VW bug. She was telling what synthetic materials had been used in lining last year to make clothes more poofy.
