I was playing a game with Ezra, which played out live. You were a superhero, I think. You had to kill some Superman villain and then The Joker, which was the furthest I had gotten. I blew them up. Then you grew. I was the size of bottle caps at the moment and was collecting them. The next stage you were the size of people, I think. You had to collect eggs. I had other people with me to help. Elijah was one of them. Then I was sitting in a hedge maze thing with Ezra and Eugene was there too. We were playing a board game. The die was made of paper and I accidentally ripped two sides of it.
