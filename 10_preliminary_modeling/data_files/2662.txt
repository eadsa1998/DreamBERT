I see the dead body of Robert Redford floating in a room full of water. His mouth is open in a round O and he is blue. I am disgusted, but can't keep my eyes off him. Somehow I am the murderer and he is going to extract revenge. He keeps floating toward me. I shut the glass and wood door to stop him and his body barks like a dog at the door, demanding I open it.
