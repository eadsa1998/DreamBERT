This dream had many parts, none of which seemed to be related. First I was square dancing on roller skates and found it very difficult to stop. Then I was taking care of a baby who had very bright blond hair. He swallowed something and my mother and I shook him until it came out. We then put him on the porch to sleep in the sun and he turned very tan. He was to be Bing Crosby's fifth son. Suddenly I was at the home of some married friends. Two of our mutual friends arrived, one of whom I dated extensively this summer. I found it necessary to laugh hysterically in their presence. I also urinated in their presence experiencing no emotion while doing so and feeling as if it were a natural occurrence. I then found myself in my own home and my great uncle who has been dead for two years visited us. I asked him why I hadn't seen him for so long, sat in his lap and he stroked my hair as he had done when I was very young. I then watched a boy whom I know only very casually have an epileptic fit--I have never witnessed one in real life.
