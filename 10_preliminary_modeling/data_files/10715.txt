I dreamed I was sitting in my room at my desk. The room did not look like mine, but rather like Doris' (18, a girl who lives in the room next to mine) room. As I was sitting at my desk looking out the window, I noticed a pen on my desk which was situated in a dish of ink. I knew that a man was in my room and I immediately ran out of the room. I asked one of the girls (I can't remember what she looked like) to come to my room and see if anyone was in the closet. We both entered the room, whereupon she opened the closet door and shut it again. Then she said I saw a man in the closet. As we fled from the room, the closet door opened and an old man darted out. We ran down the stairs, closely followed by the old man. Suddenly the other girl stopped and extended her foot. The old man stumbled over it and fell down the stairs.
