I was playing World of Warcraft. I was doing a quest and slaying something like a boar. I think I was in a new area and then I went through a portal. I wandered into this humanoid camp and this dude, who was like the leader, had 610hp and started coming after me. I had what I needed to get, and ran. I looked back after a while and he was still coming. I ran for ages but he kept following me.
