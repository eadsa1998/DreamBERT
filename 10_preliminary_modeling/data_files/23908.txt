I dreamed that I was having a drug trip.  It was kind of like a mushroom trip, it felt like that.  Some of the details were, I was outside, and I definitely knew I was tripping on a drug.  At one point I was in a cave, a cave like you would find cliff dwellings in.  I was in the back of the cave, crouched down, looking for something or crawling back further.  And a person or a voice said to me:  How many people do you have left to meet?  121, 122, 123.  And it repeated this over and over, sort of in a joking way, in that cosmic joking way.  How many people have you left to meet?  That's how it was worded.  And then counting, 121, 122.  I understood that to mean how many people I had left to meet in my life, of consequence to me.  It disturbed me a little in the dream, because I kind of thought it was telling me that this being knew when I was going to die, and through the drug trip I had opened up some communication with that knowledge.  At the end of the dream, I was running down a road, it was night, I was running after something or someone.  And I started to change into a mountain lion, or a large cat.  My body changed in sections, starting from the back, until I was a cat or a mountain lion.
