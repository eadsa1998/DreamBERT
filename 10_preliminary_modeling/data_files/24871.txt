I was at my friend's house and this guy came up to us and asked if we wanted to sell our bikes for a good price. He went to go pull out his wallet, and I knew he was going to pull out a gun, so I ran and jumped over the fence. Then I was in this lady's garden and I got into her house. She was scared, I apologized, and called 911. Then they came and captured the guy. Setting: At my best friend Nina's house. Characters: My friend Nina, I am best friends with her. The gunman I don't know. He had dark hair and a muscular build. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, worried, frantic. It was strange because it seemed like a chase in some action movie.
