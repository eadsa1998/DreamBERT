We were at a hotel. I went into this guys room to use a ruler to cut out something I had printed (an obituary). Ezra was in this creepy guy's room and he was coming back so I warned Ezra. He managed to get out in time. There was this guy there called Kit who was really hot and we became good friends. He was then Eugene, and I think we got drunk one night and we started making out.
