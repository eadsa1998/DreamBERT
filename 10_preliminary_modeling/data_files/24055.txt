Tonight I had a succession of 3 dreams that all linked up somehow. The first one took place in a castle/fortress that looked old but had tons of modern technology. For some reason myself, along with a team of others, were snooping around looking for something when an alarm went off and the place started flooding with water. Everyone is scrambling to escape and I make it out first and get to the edge of the compound, but since no one else made it, I run back to see if I can help. Everyone is leaving at a really slow pace and I'm pissed that no one is escaping seriously. I'm like, "Whatever, guys, I'm outta here!" And as I'm walking off, I wake up.
