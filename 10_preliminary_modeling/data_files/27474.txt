I dreamed I was walking in the country, over gently rolling grassy plains. I was absorbed in thought and was quite surprised when I realized how dark it had become. I started back. Then I heard my name being called very softly. I tried to run in the direction of the man's voice (I did not recognize the voice.) Just as I seemed to be getting closer to the voice, it stopped and came from another direction. I started to run again; each time I thought I was near the source of the voice, it came from another direction. Then I was running about wildly. My clothes and hair were being blown about by the wind. I was sweating profusely and wiped my face on my forearm as I ran. Soon, I became frightened and exhausted. I sat down on a rock and cried and cried. When I raised my head from my arms, it was black out and I couldn't see anything. The voice stopped while I was crying.
