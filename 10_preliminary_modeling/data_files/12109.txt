I was at school and there was a sports thing on. I was in a pool and Classmate-M-31 threw an egg and it got me and Mr Nixon. I needed to change so I went looking for a toilet. I found a cinema so I asked if I could use the toilet. They said I could. I went upstairs and there was a person doing work and I had to crawl over the table. I ended up in a house with no toilet. The house kept changing which had something to do with a time warp.
