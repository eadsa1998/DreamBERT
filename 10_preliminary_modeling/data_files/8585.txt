Matthew moved back home - all of his furniture and everything. He had placed his sectional sofa together with mine. They were along the same wall as the staircase so when I came downstairs the sofas blocked most of the bottom of the staircase. There was very little room to get around and into the room. It took me a couple of seconds to realize what he had done. He was in the living room going through stuff and getting settled back at home. I asked him about something and then said, Oh, but you're only here for a week.
