 I'm with my brother Wally at home. There is a broken light bulb. He has a kit to fix it. My mom is gone. A woman named Sue calls. She asks for Sue. I say she must have the wrong number. She doesn't have the wrong number. She is calling about her sweatshirt. Wally and this woman have a formal date. The shirt she is calling for is at the mall being cleaned or embroidered.
