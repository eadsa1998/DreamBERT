I am in the shed at my grandmother's house and the linoleum is peeling. My (now adult) son is there but he is a small baby. I am washing baby clothes in boiling water. A friend who is an Emergency Medical Technician is there. My son falls and gets hurt. He has a withered arm but the arm is restored to normal.
