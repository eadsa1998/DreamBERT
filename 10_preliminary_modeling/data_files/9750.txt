Father Andrew going downstairs in a monk's gown and sandals walks with another monk; drinks from tall bottle of water, stops to look at exhibit of drawings on wall (including some of mine (!)); "And who did these?" very approving, smiles. Then lose M, but leave with Wally and Zena; walk through sunlit street, houses and tower with clock says 5 o'clock.
