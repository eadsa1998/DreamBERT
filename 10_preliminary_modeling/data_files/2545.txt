I am at a high school, maybe T City High. It's sort of reunion time and I'm looking around. I can't find the room I'm looking for. I meet this guy. We are friends. No sex, just very connected friends. It feels wonderful. We walk arm in arm and hug and talk and really care about each other. His buddies (three of them) see us and are annoyed. So I walk up to one and grab him by his tee-shirt collar with my left hand and say, "Hey, watch this!" I wind up my right arm to pitch an imaginary baseball. I pretend to throw one. He's very impressed I can do that. So they all accept me. It's past time to go home. I'd been having such a great time, I forgot about time. Now I have to go to the bathroom. I find a bathroom with a tiny, broken toilet. I go in and remind myself not to really pee. I think I should just get up and do it right. A woman with her 4-year-old daughter opens the door and then apologizes. I then get up to walk home (like toward the M City house). I see my father in a car a block away, he's worried about me and is looking for me. He waves a black and white poster at me. I wave back, embarrassed to be late and relieved he's here to help me. We now go across "the bridge" like the railroad trestle at M City, only it's indoors and dark. I step on the wooden planks and say, "I'm afraid I hate these trestles, they're so scary." I'm afraid I'll misstep and hit a blank spot and fall or step on a rotten part and fall through. I clutch my father and he hugs me and helps me across. Finally, it's too much, so he hops down the rocky side and reaches up his arms to help me down. I am hesitant, but then jump into his arms. He catches me firmly and hugs me. I look back and see a wall of rock and say, "It's a good thing we went on the bridge after all!" We now get to the door of the house (it's like we're in a tunnel). It's locked. Oh, no! We pound on it and wait. My mother finally opens the door for us. We are home safe.
