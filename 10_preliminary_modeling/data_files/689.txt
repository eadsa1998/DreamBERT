A red faced devil comes to me and is trying to hurt me very badly. I beg him to stop but he persists. I agonized with the pain and agonized that I don't want to hurt him, but I must. I force his head into an oven where the devil face gets redder and more inflamed with pain and heat. He screams with agony. I feel sick to my stomach with the horror of it all.
