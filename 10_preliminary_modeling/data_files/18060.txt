I was in my room and dad had all my Ranger Rick magazines piled on each other and I said "What are you doing with them?" and he said "I'm giving them to Rayna" and Rayna had this nasty look on her face and she said to me, "They're not yours anymore they're mine" Then my dad gave all the magazines to Rayna and I took them right out of her hands and I put them in my room.
