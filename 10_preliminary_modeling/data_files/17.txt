Another old house - Melanie coming over - lip-synching in front of mirror to something big and bluesy - somebody came in right after, says she does the same thing - big open place like a studio - in a living room with Barbara and somebody else, visiting - talked about something like my trip somewhere, was it Renaissance Faire or SCA? Or plan for going there? Pipes on couch - had to move them to sit the way I want - plain poles like the chairset poles.
