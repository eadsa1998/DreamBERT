I am shown a sweet little kitty white with black spots, like a Dalmatian. He is called a Grandma Cat. I hold him and pet him. Then a man throws the kitties out of the compound into the dangerous outlying area. I am furious with him and stand up tall and look up at him and tell him off. How can a person who treats innocent kitties this way can be trusted as a leader of the people? I go out to the dangerous area and dig in the dirt and find a kitty like Boomer. I am so happy to find him. I must bring them back into the safety of the compound.
