Neil Patrick Harris and I had been going out for a while. Someone we knew was pregnant. Someone came up to me and said congrats and it was because I was pregnant too. I didn't know how they knew. They started telling me stuff like it was better to sleep with my hair up and to not curl your leg under you and I said that I wasn't keeping it, because I wasn't going to waste my life etc. There was a church thing nearby where couples were getting married. We decided to get married too. It cost nothing and I said I didn't want any fancy stuff. The person doing it said that he could tell we were in love etc because of the way we looked at each other.
