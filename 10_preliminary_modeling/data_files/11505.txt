Dream is set in a seashore resort. Subject and subject's family are guests of a household at the resort. (The family of the household is unknown to subject.) The woman of the house is beautiful and desirable. She and subject meet on a side porch of the house. Subject takes physical liberties with willing hostess (fondling). Host passes and perceives action between subject and host's wife. Hostess remains calm; subject becomes terrified. Hostess remarks that she will have to get her other body and to meet her on the back porch. Hostess is still beautiful, but she has aged approximately 20 years. Subject proceeds to engage hostess in sexual intercourse. Due to the aging of the hostess the intercourse is unsatisfactory to subject, whereupon the subject replaces his pants and leaves. The subject now momentarily awakened and then resumed his night's sleep.
