I don't know if this is all going to fit, but I'm going to try. Last night I had a very interesting dream, but it kept unfolding and unwinding. It started out that I had done something with the Peavey system in our back yard. Apparently we had been like having a party or something, like a neighborhood association, and I was starting to pack up the Peavey system and I went to put a cushion or something in the garage, and I got some seed and I noticed that in addition to our chicken, we now had like three or four ducks and two geese. And the ducks and geese were white and it was hard to tell them apart, and there were also one or two Muskogee ducks. And I was thinking, "How cool is that!" And I got the notion that somebody was moving out. Nobody told me, but I remembered Mom telling me in my dream that somebody had been moving out and gave us their ducks and geese to take care of. And they were really tame, and they were coming up to me and eating. And then I started packing up the Peavey system, and I realized that my power cord had been just severed, just like that, for some reason, and then I was on the front porch and I was calling the Peavey place to see if I could get an extra one. And Mom read me a serial number off of it that I copied down. And the person on the phone was asking me like, "Well, did you step on it? Did something happen? What happened here?" And all I could them was there was a bunch of commotion going on at this party and that's all I knew. And so then I went back out in the back yard and I realized that the severed cord wasn't the Peavey power cord, it was one of those extension cords. So then I continued packing up and I noticed that there was a keyboard on a stand next to my Peavey board table, and I had the notion that it was from the people that were moving out and they just kind of left it there. I kind of thought it was that, but I also kind of thought that maybe I had a musician at the party and they left it there. But anyway, I picked it up off the stand and wanted to carry it in the house and it was really heavy and I could barely its weight and mass. And I tried to open the door and I couldn't open the door, and I almost opened the thing. And I put it down and I opened the door, and I picked it up again. And I walked through the house, upstairs, and I slid it under my bed. And I don't remember going back to pack up the rest of the Peavey system, but I heard that later Mom and Dad were going to be going off somewhere for a little while, and I said, "Yahoo!" And I took it out again, and I set it on top, and then I realized that somebody had taken like really fancy beads and costume jewelry, like a really long necklace, and strung it like across the front of it. The necklace was just long enough to fit the width of the unit. And there was this _____ set of beads and charms and old b______ and stuff flopping around on its right side, hanging from the chain _______. [laugh] ___________________________. But then I realized that I felt guilty because I thought that the unit might be Oxama's, but then I kept having to remember that it was from those people who were moving out. It felt so weird to me. I said, "Okay, this is probably not a dream," and then I woke up and I was like, "Yes, it is." [laugh] That was that.
