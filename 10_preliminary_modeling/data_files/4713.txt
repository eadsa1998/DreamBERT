["Teaching assertiveness."] I am at a fast food restaurant. The man manager is having trouble giving direction and getting results from the waitresses. I step in and show him how to listen well to them and paraphrase and be assertive. I demonstrate to him how to do this with a woman waitress. She responds well to my communication. The man is standing very close to me, leaning into me. He seems to be attracted to me.
