I was sitting at one of our tables in the dorm dining room. Suddenly I remembered I owed two of the girls some money. I gave it (change) to one of the girls next to me, and asked her to give the rest to the other girl. As I was handing her the money, our housemother popped up at my side and acted as if she wanted the money. I told her I would pay her later and as she stayed there, I got out my billfold (still sitting at the table) and gave her $1.15, which is the amount for a dinner in the dorm. I do not remember having a guest at dinner.
