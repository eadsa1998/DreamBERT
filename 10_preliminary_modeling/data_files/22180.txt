I dreamed that I was lying in bed and suddenly I started to be raised horizontally, parallel to my bed, and that little by little my body moved slowly throughout the house until I was in the living room. Suddenly I was with somebody and that person was covered with a sheet. When I went over to uncover him, the sheet disappeared and a horrible monster scared me and tried to catch me. I screamed loudly, with fear, and then, bit by bit, my body went back and the monster chased me in slow motion, but he wasn't able to reach me because bit by bit my body reached the bed and the monster disappeared and I awoke at the same time.
