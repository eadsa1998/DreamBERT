This dream was a very disconnected one. It began when I was riding in a car with my girlfriend's boyfriend. The two of them had had a fight. It seems that we drove for hours and hours. Later I got out of the car and started walking. A middle aged man picked me up and put my suitcase in the back of the car(!!) He kept giving me sly looks and I realized he was going to kidnap me. Five young men came down the street and walked straight towards me. I said, "Don't you dare take another step!" and they stopped. The next thing I knew I was in A------. I was walking with someone who was saying something to the Eskimos. It seemed that he was saying "oogie woogie" or some similar phrase such as that! I remember it was very cold and there was a sharp wind. I remember seeing a great deal of snow.
