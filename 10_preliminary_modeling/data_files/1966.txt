I am a chaperone to a group of high school kids. We get up early. I feel tired. We go to the bus and look for a restaurant to have breakfast. We get one, but there isn't room for all of us, so four of us go on down the street to find another restaurant. I think we are in France. We can't find one that doesn't breakfast. We find one that has English words on the menu: Cheese, Fish. Beef. Ellie wants to eat there. I am disappointed. I wanted a breakfast. I am in my van. Bonnie is driving. I'm in my wheelchair in the back. We stop at a gas station. I open an envelope with lots of cash in it, ready to pay for the gas. A man opens the back door and starts talking to me. He looks at the money. At first I think he's the gas station attendant. Then I realize he's a crazy man and I feel concerned. He gets out and goes in his own sports car. We start to drive out. I'm still holding the $10 bill. I say, "We didn't pay, did we?" Bonnie says, "No," so she drives back and we drive through a number of times looking for someone to take the money. Finally we give up, feeling we'd done all we could and left. Now we are at my parents'. I have a baby with me I'd promised to watch after. I feel concerned because I'd handed her over to two different parties and maybe should be more responsible. I have a pile of clothing that belongs to the baby and my mother starts to put it away. I say, "No, wait. I want it out here. I'll use it several times a day." She is annoyed but leaves it out.
