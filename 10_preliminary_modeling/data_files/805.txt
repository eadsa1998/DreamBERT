A conversation between 2 women, both myself, I think. One said, "Look. See, she told me about it." The other laughed and said, "Oh, ya?" She didn't believe it. I was a little embarrassed, like being caught in a little white lie. I said, "Well, anyway, she showed me...sort of...in an indirect non-verbal way."
