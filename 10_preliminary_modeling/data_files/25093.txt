 I'm eating lunch with Carmen Allure, a high school classmate, and her older sister Harmony Allure, whom I had a crush on in high school. I am eating ribs and get my light blue shirt dirty. Harmony eats a caramel roll. There is an awards ceremony, like the Oscars or the Grammy's. My friend Marybeth Neumann and her mother are there and they have good seats. I see her on television. Then I am there and I see her. We hug. She is wearing a brown striped suit, and looks good in it. I also see Ron Lind and Blinky Ahmed, high school classmates.
