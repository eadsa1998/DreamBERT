["Chakotay and the crazy man."] Chakotay needs to hide. The crazy man is after him. Chakotay runs quickly toward a door. It is locked. So he hides under a pile of blankets on the floor. The dream ego is with him watching the crazy man from his perspective under the blankets. The crazy man senses him there and comes close, poking in the pile. Chakotay remains quiet and doesn't move. The crazy man has a baby with him and lays the baby down on Chakotay. It is a tense moment. The crazy man leaves, not finding him.
