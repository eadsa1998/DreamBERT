I went into a locker like. It was too tight inside, so I propped my knees against one side and broke the wall thru. I was at St. Andrew's church. I started to walk away and I heard someone yelling John Evans. I paid no attention, but walked away, then I stopped and turned around and looked and I saw and heard a woman yelling Evans, so I walked in and a man walked towards me and gave me a big package. I had won a prize. Someone gave me a wallet. It was loaded with money. I looked at some of the bills and there were $50 bills in it also. I am not sure it was to be mine or belonged to me, but it seemed to be mine. I was climbing up a rock span. I got on top and Bob was coming behind me. Some of the rocks were crumbling and he backed down a little, then started to come back up. I went down under the house. It was dark. I had a flashlight and I walked to my bed in there.
