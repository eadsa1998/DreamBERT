Am in Stockholm on business and decide to take a trolley car to a store with the name of Batlle. Conductor says fare is 50 cents and I ask him if he said 50 cents or 15 cents. He mumbles something that sounds like maybe 50 cents, but I decide he really means 15 cents. I put a nickel and a dime in the fare box. At Batlle the clerk shows me a solid-looking 35mm viewfinder type camera. Price is $31. I look at camera and tell him it appears to be just what I need for my daughter. He leaves and I examine camera, but the more I look at it, the less satisfactory it appears. There are bright blue and red labels and a roll of film with instruction sheet how to put in camera. But the sheet comes apart and case doesn't seem to fit. I assume it is a display camera and the clerk left to get me a better one. I wait a long time and he still doesn't return.
