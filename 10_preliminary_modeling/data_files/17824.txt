I decided to go back to high school, to sit in on some trigonometry classes for a while, since grad school and community college are out of the question right now.  I walked through and saw one of the PE teachers Ms. Miller.  I nearly sat down in class, but wasn't sure.  I continued on to the office to get permission from the principle Mr. Davidson.  Being a valedictorian, I didn't expect it should be any problem whatsoever.  We talked for a bit and it was friendly..until finally he told me no, he couldn't allow me to- referring back to the incident at the detox facility.  He said he couldn't be sure what drugs I'd taken, and he couldn't have that influence around the kids no matter how much he liked me.  I was appalled he'd even heard of the issue and horrified by the injustice, incredibly hurt.  I was out of control again, something out of my hands and not up for discussion once again ruining my plans in life.  I left to cry.
