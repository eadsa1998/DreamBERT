 I talk with my sister Ramona and other family members. I am forceful and assertive in my opinions. I say that I don't think Ramona loves her classmate Jeff Grace: I think she has flipped head-over-heels for him, but it's not love. I think Ramona is confused, and I speculate on her and Jeff's relationship. At some point Ramona leaves and goes to call Jeff.
