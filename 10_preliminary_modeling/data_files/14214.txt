I was at school, which was different, with Mom and Ezra. It was pretty much empty. The ground started shaking and Brianna and Selena came out of nowhere and we all ran into this building, which was the girl's toilets and stood under the door frame. It shook a lot. Then it stopped and we went out and said it wasn't an earthquake. I said it was became they don't come in waves. I was thinking it was like Cloverfield. We went down to this place and I had to crawl through this vent and go through the teacher's area. I ended up in this shop/cinema. Ezra and I started grabbing bags and chocolates and water. Then I was in a shed place with some people. Shaun Micallef was there. He was going to talk to some guy. Mom was outside. It was night. I kept looking at the city waiting to see a Cloverfield like monster. Then Michael Stahl-David and some others were on a boat and they fell into the water. They drove the boat to some oxygen tank in the water. Then I was watching a movie. This guy had a scar on the right side of his face. He was talking to this guy in a pub, I think, and told him the story of how he got the scar with a few details omitted. He knew the guy he was talking to had given him the scar. Shortly after they almost got into a fight but then the guy said "I'm Jack Lint" and the guy was shocked and then was laughing evilly. The scar guy attacked him somehow.
