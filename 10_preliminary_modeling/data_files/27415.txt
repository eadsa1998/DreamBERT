I saw H___ A___ run out of a department store in A___ with his arms loaded down with oranges, pears, apples and grapes. He kept dropping fruit all over and he also dropped a toy truck that had a great number of little white blocks in it. The blocks fell out all over the floor and two clerks one a girl and the other a younger boy stopped to pick them up. The girl just stood and counted them while the boy put them in the truck. Among the blocks was a spool of thread. I was watching the proceedings and I was scared that they were going to discover the spool of thread. For some reason if they saw the thread H__ would be in some kind of danger. But the boy thought the spool was another block and put it in the truck. I was relieved and I walked away.
