I went to Whitehall High School but I don't know why. I went into a computer room and Tiana and others were in there playing Warcraft. Some of the other people called out to me and I stood still and concentrated and 'teleported', but I was still in the same place (they couldn't see me though). I was watching The Young Ones and Rik was sick in bed and there was another Rik standing over him and I said "Rik, Rik" in his 'conscience voice'. This guy nearby was watching and said "you like Young Ones?". There was a pool and a rake attached to a pipe and you had to control it and put it down. A lady was with me.
