There are these really beautiful freshman girls. I was trying to get them to meet me at the dining hall. I walked by two of them outside their dorm. They looked at me. I kept walking down the path until I got to the beach. I thought about telling them about my new ideas, as I sat on the beach. These ideas were the discovery that certain commercial voices were those of celebrities. This high-pitched cartoon cat voice, along with the Taco Bell Chihuahua characters, were the voice of the lead singer of the Bee Gees.
