Dad, Ezra and I went to a restaurant on this beach area. It was night. I was wearing my Spongebob shirt and these light blue shorts with fluffballs on them. Dad was wearing the same colour. We got there 'late'. This lady said the special was chicken with a nice spice sauce. When we finally got our meal it was mixed with rice and gravy and they were like 'woops'.
