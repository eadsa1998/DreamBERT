I was at a house. Ezra was there but I was in my room and we were talking on MSN. Dad was finishing work soon and was probably taking us to the movies. The movie had Jensen Ackles in it and Ezra and I joked about it. Mom picked me up from somewhere and was taking me back. She said she had to take the train back and I asked why and she said it was because of the L-plates. I was confused and questioned it and then she realized what she'd said. I called Dad to ask if we were still going. He said he just finished work and said he'd let us know soon. It was already 9.20pm though.
