 I'm going fishing with my mom, an old lady, and a young man. We are going to fish on the Main River. It is evening. I pull the boat into the water, rather than backing it in. I'm not sure which vehicle I'm driving. There is a tree in the way, so I decide to back the boat in. When we put the boat in, the landing is filled with huge rocks. My mom wants to be back by 6:00 am so I figure we have a good two hours to fish. I go and park the trailer. I drive down the road a ways and find a driveway I can turn around in. I think that the mosquitoes probably won't be bad because of something, but it is evening so they'll be worse than usual. We lift the boat in, scraping it on the rocks. The anchor is hanging out. There is a dammed up stream leading out to the river that we travel in before getting to bay on the river. It is like we are portaging. There are broken oars all along the river and in the dam. I step on the dam-made of intertwined sticks and leaves and oars-to pull the boat through. There are many boats out in the bay. It is packed. There is good smallmouth bass fishing. We travel out of the stream. There is a man driving a nice boat with a trolling motor on it, going the opposite way. <br/
