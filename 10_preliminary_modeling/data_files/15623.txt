Dad, Ezra, Tyrion (Game of Thrones) and I were going to some religious place in Italy to learn priesthood stuff and become maesters. Dad and Ezra got dropped at one point. I was in a fancy-ish hotel. I drove and Tyrion took the bus. I followed him to make sure I got to the right place. It was #999. I went in with Tyrion and he dropped his glasses case and I picked it up for him. The glasses were very round and fancy, but old. I wondered where I was supposed to go.
