In my fourth dream I was in McDonald's getting some French fries. Then I went to the bus stop to get on the bus. When I got on the bus the bus driver took my French fries and started eating them while driving. I noticed he had a McDonald's cup near him on the window side. While driving I saw the top of buildings and the top of trees. As I got off the bus, the bus driver gave me a beautiful sapphire ring. I smiled. As soon as I got in the house I called my ex-boyfreind. Bobby (who I just broke up with recently), but his mother told me he wasn't home and hung up on me. Then I woke up.
