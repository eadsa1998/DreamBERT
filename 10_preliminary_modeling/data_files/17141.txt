After work, I planned on going to get some food and run it over to surprise the Red Dwarf crew- old friends I hadn't seen in a while.  That meant going through space of course.  Red Dwarf was just off to the left.  Whatever fast food place it was, it was new.  Kind of like in a food court, I suppose.  The counter was huge.  I was in the middle on the right side of the counter corner in line.  As they kept calling, I eventually ended up on the very end on the left side.  It was an hour and a half wait.  They kept taking people around me.  I ordered four burgers and a fish sandwich for Cat, two orders of fries, a root beer, orange soda, and they didn't have zucchini pieces like I wanted.  I got the fries, though minimal serving sizes, and the drinks, but the sandwiches never came.  I was upset.  While waiting in line before ordering, someone approached me and asked where I was working now- no longer sleeping on the steps outside the bank.  I had trouble explaining that I did that while waiting for my mother, not because I was a bum.  While waiting for the food, I talked to Dharma and Abbey (from Dharma and Greg) who were in line next to me.  Like old friends.  I felt good because I knew they'd help out if I were having problems.  Dharma sure was tall.  Finally I gave up and left without the food.  I couldn't find the car- someone had moved it.  I ran into my classmate Dawn and her mom.  Finally I found the car, but the key wouldn't open the door.  Dawn had already left.  I willed the key to fit the lock so I could at least open the door.  Things changed after that.  I was at the Radisson hotel at night in the parking lot.  I don't know who the guy was, but there was a flash of light as he entered my view.
