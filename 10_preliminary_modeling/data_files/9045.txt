A parish council election bad dream. At the Sunday 8:00 am Mass Father Jerry decided to make a change in the parish council election that had started the evening before. One of the nominees was standing in front of church and she said something that she didn't seem to think there was anything wrong with. However, Father Jerry really didn't like it. He immediately told the congregation that she would not be eligible to be voted in to the parish council. He then he was going to announce some names and he wanted the people he announced to come to the front of church. He called five or six people. After they all got to the front of church he announced that these six people were now nominees along with the people on the ballot. I was aggravated by this and concerned about what this was going to do to the process I already had in place.
