In this dream I remember being at a large building. It reminded me of the First National Bank Bldg. where I used to work, but I don't think that was the building. I was in the garage portion that was at street level. I recall that I was looking for my car. I looked across the street and saw what I thought was my car, but when I went over to it, I saw that it wasn't mine. It was the same make, model, and color as mine, but it had blue plastic seat covers on it, and my car doesn't have any seat covers. I remember that I was a little irritated that I walked all the way over to this car and it wasn't mine. Then I recall looking back toward the garage and seeing my car. I went over and it was my car. The last I recall I was looking at the interior of my car and recognizing sort of confirming that it was my car because it didn't' have seat covers on it.
