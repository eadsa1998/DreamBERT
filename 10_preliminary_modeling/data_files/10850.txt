In this dream I was informed by a doctor and different other people that I was going to die, but no one seemed to know just why or how much longer I would live. Throughout the dream I was more upset because of the uncertainty of the disease than the thought of dying, and I was frantically questioning different individuals for the name of my fated illness. Most of the participants of the dream were rather vague, unidentifiable figures, even the doctor. I do remember my mother's presence though, but oddly enough she was not too upset about the whole thing; she did, however, try to obtain the cause for my imminent death. Supposedly blisters would appear around my eyes shortly before the end. The whole thing seemed rather inconceivable to me even in the dream. I couldn't believe that there was anything wrong with me, but I was still very disturbed by it all.
