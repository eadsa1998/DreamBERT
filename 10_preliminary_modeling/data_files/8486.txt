I was making a children's slide out of bamboo rods. I cut all the rods and laid them horizontally along the slide. I took a bunch more pieces and cut them and stood them vertically along each edge of the slide. I was telling someone that after I finished it I was going to take a sander and sand off the tops of the vertical ones and then put some polyurethane on them so they wouldn't be rough - so the children wouldn't get scraped or scratched or cut or snag their clothes. Then I started wondering if the horizontal pieces of bamboo were going to be slick enough. It seems that I did something, but I don't think I put polyurethane on those. It seems that I was going to put something else on those so it would be slick like a slide. It seems to me that an adult tested it for me. They did slide down but it was very slowly and they got stuck at a couple of places. It wouldn't be much fun for a child to slide down that slow. I was thinking about what else I would put on top of it to make it slick so a child could have fun sliding down.
