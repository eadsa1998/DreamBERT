[1997-05-05] We are in my parents' car, I am sitting in the back seat, I could feel that it was morning and we had to go to 2 weddings in New York, one on a Wednesday and another one on a Saturday. And I knew that my father didn't want to go and I said, "yeah I know, but at least they're both together and at least if we're going to one we might as well go to the other one as well. When we got there, we had to climb up a lot of flights of stairs because my aunt lived in the building but we had to climb up to the fifth floor, it was the same house that we visited a long, long time ago. I could feel the stairs under my feet, the so I knew we were climbing up the same stairs. I don't know how, but somehow I had also arrived in a cab too inside my parents were not there but I do not remember the weddings, somehow it jumped and we were at my parents' house having a big party and there were people there and they were all eating different things, and my brother in law was there too and we were all talking animatedly and I can remembered eating grinders. My brother in law had to leave in the middle and I could hear him going up the stairs to his house to the second floor and I was entertaining a lot of the people when he left. And then some other person came in, a relative of one of the people at the party, and we were all having a big dinner and talking and enjoying it, we were all happy and I can't remember some of the conversations but we were all talking, and I can't remember what time of day it was, exactly.
