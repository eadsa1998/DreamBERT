I dreamed I was in a place I didn't know with people I didn't know, strange animals, old people. I don't know in what place my dream was happening, or rather, I think I don't remember whether I recognized it. I watched how they laughed, how they shouted, how they talked. I also participated in the conversation, but I don't know what it was about. I don't know what we were talking about; it was just a group of people talking and we answered all in the affirmative. I don't know when I stopped dreaming.
