I went for a drive with Mom and we went to some underground carpark, then to someone's house. They had these weird things for the pool. They were long, grassy, green things that were used as 'tubes'. We went back to the car and there was an alcohol/drug tester bus. Mom called out to me that she was ready to go and we left and didn't get stopped (by calling out she was pretending she had been tested). I had an email from Roland and it was signed "love".
