At least once a week I get the same dream over and over again, and it usually starts the same and ends at the exact same spot. Okay, let me just start off by telling you that when I was a child, my parents got a divorce and a while after that my father was mad cause my mom had full custody and never wanted to see him again. For a while he was trying to see me, and take me from mom. And one time my mom was not home, I was with my brothers alone and we were all asleep when he climbed in the bedroom window and carried me out the door. Usually that's what I dream about: him coming in the window, picking me up from my 15-year-old snoring brother's side and carrying me out to the car with the motor running, just waiting to speed off. Then the car skids away and I wake up.
