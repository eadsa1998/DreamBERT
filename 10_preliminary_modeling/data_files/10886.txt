I came into a living room with my boyfriend. There were 2 or 3 small children. One was 2-1/2 and another 1-1/2. I seemed to get their names by reading a Hebrew newspaper. A middle-aged woman, dark complexioned with black hair and wearing a print dress came into the room. She said she was his wife. I was shocked and surprised and was a little angry that he had not told me about her. I seemed to vacillate between withdrawing from the entire situation feeling maybe he's not worth it all and between sticking it out and fighting. As I felt he would be happier with me than with his wife. I felt quite uneasy, but the woman began speaking to me and she seemed very friendly. I then felt at ease and comfortable.
