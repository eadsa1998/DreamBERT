I dreamed that I was driving along the street and the traffic was very heavy. There was a woman who was swinging from one lane of traffic into another. My roommate was with me. She is a school teacher, 23, I commented to her about this stupid driver, alongside of us at the present time. Although the windows of my car were closed, the woman heard me and looked at me as though she was quite insulted. After she had looked at me in this manner, she turned her car directly toward me and drove right into my car. The woman driving the other car seemed to be about 40 years old.
