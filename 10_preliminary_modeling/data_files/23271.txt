I had a chance to throw a pass in a football game.  I held the ball too long, because I couldn't get a good grip on it, even though it was low on air, and by the time I launched the pass, the receiver was beyond my range-even though I felt I could have gotten the ball to him if I had gotten the full potential from my arm, which I didn't.
