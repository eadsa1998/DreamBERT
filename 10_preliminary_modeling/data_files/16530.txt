It wasn't really Halloween, but for some reason people were like dressing up and doing crazy stuff like that. And there were some kids from the neighborhood, big tall kids, dressed up as Ursula and for some reason the spell I remember that wasn't really in the movie was that Ursula had a seashell locket with a voice in it. She could cut somebody's foot and make them sing the song, and then she would draw their voice into the shell. And then here's the strangest part of all: Samantha and Sandra and Derek were like touching me and beating me up in the bathtub, trying to get me to sing a Led Zeppelin song I didn't even know. And Derek had a dog, like a Dalmatian, that would just go nuts every time somebody would enter into the room. Oh, and the person dressed up like Ursula who was trying to put spells on people, in my dream I took a lantern and I whacked and whacked and whacked the person's face with the lantern, thinking that I was going to get all the spell power out of Ursula. And Ladies and Gentlemen, I believe that is all for this tape. I'm not going to be able to put another thing on this tape, so that's it.
