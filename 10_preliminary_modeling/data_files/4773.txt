["Howling about God."] I am showing a woman the rough draft of a children's book I created. It is dumped up on large tracing paper. She will be the critic. I hesitate to show her my writing part, before she does the official critique, because I don't want to prejudice or influence her decisions. But I say you must take a look at the illustrations. They are wonderful. Someone else did them. I fold a page or two over so she can see the colorful illustrations. I tell her that two men are doing this work. They are "howling about God." One is a Jew and another is Catholic.
