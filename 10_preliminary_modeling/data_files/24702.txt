I was in the dining hall at my camp and we were singing camp songs really loudly and having a great time. Then the background changed, and I was in a forest under the stars with my sleeping bag, when I realized that I forgot to pack my clothes. The background changed again, and I was in line with my camp friend to vault. She said, "Well, if your mom brings cool clothes that's great, but if she doesn't you can borrow mine." I then saw my mom rushing by and I asked her to make a list of the clothes I wanted. As I was making the list, I woke up. (Sometime in the dream, I can't remember when, I got in a fight with my sister.) Setting: At camp, in a forest, and in my gymnastics school (where I was in line to vault). Characters: My mom, my dad, my sister, my two friends from camp, my friend's older sister, her friends, my friends from school, my counselors at camp, many kids I don't know. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, angry, sad, worried, hate, resentful, excited. I was worried, sad, resentful and angry when I lost my clothes. I was happy and excited in the dining hall. I felt hate when I got in a fight with my sister.
