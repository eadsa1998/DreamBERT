 I'm in Lakeville with some people driving in a car. The city is much bigger than it really is. In the car is a woman describing to me who a person named Matt Bateman is. He goes to Brimson but I can't think of whom he may be. My friend Tom Napper is there, and says Matt Bateman ran cross-country with him. My sister's grade school playmate Belinda Bark is in the car. We drive down a street. It is winter. The road is covered with slush and snow. I see two Nanger brothers that are dressed up for the prom. They are wearing long overcoats. Miles Nanger's tie is very long, almost down to his knees. I comment on how long it is, and say I went to school with him. I se a photograph processing center and remember I have some photographs to pick up. I say this and we go to get them. I get two packages of photographs. My package costs $17, and my roommate Sean Williams' costs $3. I am very surprised at this. I think it should be the other way around because Sean had the fancy processing done, not I. I look and the package that the woman said was $17 is mine: I see a photo of grandma Redding.
