An actor was in town at a local establishment, maybe a restaurant. He was engaging primarily with me and the people who were traveling with him. I don't know why me. When I first saw him I thought, Oh, I've always liked this man. He always seems like such a nice man. I don't know who it was though. I have the name Benjamin Bratt in my head but I know it wasn't him and I haven't paid much attention to him in waking life. Anyway, he was going to be doing a kind of impromptu singing performance and he wanted to sing primarily to me. He pulled a wedding or engagement ring out of his pocket for a prop. He asked me if I liked it. I said I did. The ring had one large diamond in the middle and was surrounded by two rows of smaller, yet not small, diamonds. The ring was not a full circle - it was adjustable. I put it on the ring finger of my left hand. I took it off a time or two and put it back on. He was sitting across from me, maybe at a table. I put my left hand on top of my right hand, somewhat outstretched in front of me. My hands were tan. I checked my nails to see what kind of shape my manicure was in. They looked fine. I think I did this more than once as well. It seems that after that he was maybe sitting on a stool, or some chair that made him higher than me. He was still sitting in front of me but he picked up my hands and laid them on his right leg. I don't remember seeing the ring on my hand. Some of the other people there were envious that I was getting all of his attention. There was nothing romantic about it but there was something about me that he found endearing and comfortable maybe. I was enjoying myself but I don't think I was really feeling flattered, or honored, to be the center of his attention.
