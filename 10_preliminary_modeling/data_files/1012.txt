I'm in a house, getting ready to go home. Howard is there. He wants to kiss me and go home with me. I want to be nice to him but I don't want him back. If I'm nice to him, he'll move right in. I feel trapped. Then, Curtis of Nighthawks comes in. He doesn't pay a lot of attention to me. He stands near me. I say, "I know you." He says, "I don't know you." I say, "Of course. I like your music." "Ya?," he says. "Did you buy my album?" I say, "No, not yet," and explain why not. He starts to dance. It's very complicated. I recognize it as a dance I saw on T.V. and join in. He's very pleased and impressed that I can do it. We dance. We draw closer. I am sexually attracted to him and I'm feeling anger. He responds to me. I draw him toward the bedroom. He stops and says, "I want to make love, but not now, not here. Let's wait a few days." I get angrier. He's just trying to reject me. He doesn't really like me. I walk away and try to sneak out so he'll miss me and never know where to find me. He runs after me and apologizes. He gives me reasons why he wanted to wait that are logical (no contraceptives, wants it to be nicer place, etc.), and says he's sorry he should have let me know that he liked me. He just doesn't know how to express it very well. I forgive him. It's hard to wait.
