I am in some room, like a medical office or maybe even a really clean bathroom. There is an electronic scale in the room and I walk over to it and step on. I am amazed to see that I have somehow lost 10 lbs., even though I have been lifting weights for almost two months and just gained about five pounds. I was really let down that all my effort had gone to waste and that I actually weighed less than when I started working out.
