A girl from China was closing the windows. Eileen kept opening the windows. It was somebody's birthday. We didn't know whose but Eileen had baked a cake. There was a ramp. There were rules--you had to worry a lot about the rules till you crossed the ramp and you could see from the other side it really didn't make any difference in price and what you could carry. There was an old house that was made into new apartments without doors. I was supposed to be moving there but I didn't understand where one apartment ended and another began. It was not a loft. Out front was a big old oak tree with low branches and a table had been built around the tree, in a big square, with room for people to sit in chairs between the tree and the table. Lots of apples were stacked up on the table in a pyramid. They were green apples and huge--about the size of soccer balls. Alicia was there with her girlfriend whose name was Rex. I kept walking in at the wrong time when they were getting all touchy feely private with each other. Rex told me, "Why don't you just draw a rope and I'll hang myself." Guys at the table around the tree were laughing and talking. Seven African children were naked, playing in the mud. Covered in mud. This was in appreciation to their mother. They sat at the table all around her. I was looking for a box to prop my head up on. A wood block. On the sidewalk people were confused. A huge crowd dispersed. I didn't know if it had ever been there or not. I was up the street talking--listening to a lady whose mind was somewhere else.
