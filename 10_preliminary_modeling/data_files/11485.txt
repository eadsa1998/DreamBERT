While walking to class I met a close friend with whom I often go out on double dates. Upon meeting Phil, my friend, he told me that he had to make a stop for about 15 minutes during our date that Saturday. He wanted to know if it was alright with me, because I was driving that Saturday. I was very confused because I thought Phil had previously told me that he couldn't go with us that Saturday, so I made arrangements to go with another couple.
