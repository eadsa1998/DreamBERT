I dreamed that Lou and I were in an elevator folding laundry, and he started massaging my shoulders. I got all tingly. Then I massaged his. Then we started kissing in the elevator, and I put my hand on his chest. For some reason, that felt really sexual and I woke up kind of embarrassed, even though nothing really happened.
