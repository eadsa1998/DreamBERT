I remember this dream very vaguely, but the image that lingers on is that of making the preparations for a tip we were going to make for the Independence Day holidays. One of my sisters was packing her bags to go to Cuzco, another one to go to Ica, and I to go to Mexico. (This is really going to take place, if nothing goes wrong; at least we are making plans for this.)
