Matthew and some of my family members were helping me to move back into my house on Lakeland Dr. It had been almost completely remodeled on the inside. It looked much newer. The previous owners had left tons of their stuff in almost every room. In almost every closet there is a vacuum, each different than the other. It was mostly single women who lived on the cul-de-sac.
