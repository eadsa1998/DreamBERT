The Ruiz family is on a hill underneath buildings at a skyline. They are telling me in a mix of English and Spanish that someone has died. I can't understand who -- I think it is Ellen -- of cancer. Later I find out she's not dead but I still don't know who is dead. Calia is the one who has spoken to me. We are out in public and Ellen is there later. Calia is carrying a purse.
