I'm sleeping in bed with my wife and I decide to untie the string that holds her pajama tops up. I do so in the dream. This morning when we got up, I noticed that it was untied, so maybe I actually did this in my sleep. All sorts of fragments in this dream about me caring for my wife and rubbing her. In the last part of the dream I was up in this room in what seemed like an attic apartment, and my wife was with me, and this man about 18 or 19 years old who had been bothering us was there. And I was reading some sort of advertisement near the fire with a pair of scissors in my hand. He comes up and puts the needle from a hypodermic syringe in my hand. He's trying to get something against me legally and this was supposed to indicate that I was practicing medicine without a license or something like that cause I was standing there by the fire with this advertisement and scissors in my hand. And I immediately write down an account of exactly what he did and have my wife witness it. I write it with black crayon on the wall of the room, and when I write it down, I also have something in there about how this person wanted me to sell him a book and insisted on it when I didn't want to sell him one. This had some other sort of legal implications also.
