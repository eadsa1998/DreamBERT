We were at a hotel thing. There was a playground in it and it was really colourful. I went up a slide and fell back down. It was snowing and there were tornado's everywhere. I went up all the stairs to this room with Calvin and two other people but it was stingy so we went back to the hotel. On floor 9, people wouldn't let us in unless we paid them with matchsticks.
