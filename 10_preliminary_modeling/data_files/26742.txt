 There is some type of battle of conflict. More and more people are on my side, increasingly. I am trigger-happy: nervous and agitated. I fire my gun without discretion at some people, for which I am criticized. A mad sergeant-type man comes up to me and demands that I give him my gun. He threatens me. I don't give it to him. Instead I shoot him several times in the chest. It seems to be make-believe shooting: lines of orange-yellow pellets come out of the gun. He is not dead or injured. He chases me with a knife. We fight. I hit him with my gun. At one point I think I should just let him kill me because I will not die. He didn't die when I shot him, so I'll be fine.
