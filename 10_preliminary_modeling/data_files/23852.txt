I dreamed I got a dog.  And I loved getting that dog.  I was really glad about that.  And I was at like a family reunion, Uncle Larry was there, and my cousin Amy, and Dad and my sisters.  There was something about cleaning the house, and I opened up my little vacuum cleaner that I have, and inside were these big beetles, like big ball-shaped Utah-type beetles, like the ones that roll the poop around, inside, and they were still even a little alive.  And I remembered vacuuming them up in Utah, and I talked with Dad about doing that.  We were both surprised that they were still alive.  This dog was white or light-colored, smaller than Risk, and more curly-haired, younger.
