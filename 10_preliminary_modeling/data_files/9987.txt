We are at Father Andrew's house; it is very tightly organized; I talk about small details and help carry dishes, teapot, etc. and go through some narrow spaces and almost drop them, but don't.There is a FIRE next door; see big orange flames and firemen fighting the fire, but we are not afraid. Later I see a fireman who is all covered with black smoke, relieved at being cool, but we feel his heat and we move away....
