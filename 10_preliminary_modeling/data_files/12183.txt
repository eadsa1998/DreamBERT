I was friends with Ezra and we were at the library at school. He decided to stay at Brookland High School. We were going through a carpark and I dropped my shoes, so I went back and got them. Then we dropped Ezra's shoes and a lady took one, but I got it back. She kept trying to break my arm. These people were running from the bad guys, and some were getting killed. This guy hid in a strange place. Someone didn't believe something (that I don't remember) was down these holes. There was something to do with bread. Nana was waiting for a helicopter. I was angry at some person and some dude was laughing because I was angry.
