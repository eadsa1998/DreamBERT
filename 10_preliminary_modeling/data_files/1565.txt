Howard comes to me and wants me to come back to him. He smiles warmly and says, "Are you crying? Are you blushing?" I look away, smiling a little and say, "No, I'm not." He says, "Yes, you are," and touches my cheek. I say, "I don't want to come back to you." He says, "It's o.k." He bends over and tenderly kisses me on the lips. I kiss him back. I feel happy.
