I was staying at Grandpa and Grandma's house.  There was a girl in the bathroom off the bedroom I planned to stay in, so I thought I had better get some clothes out of the dresser in there and move to the next bedroom.  (They were side by side down a corridor, like in a hotel.)  But when she came out of the bathroom, she said I could stay there and we could share the bed.  I thought there wasn't much danger Grandpa or Grandma would look in, so I agreed.  It seemed I had slept there with Annie Murdock once before.  I asked the girl if she knew Annie.  I don't remember what she said, but we did talk about other mutual acquaintances, including Gaylen Tuttleson.  I think this girl's name was Annie too.  She wasn't really attractive, with dark hair, a rather sharp nose, and slightly prominent front teeth-but she wasn't ugly either.  She said she wished she had a map of the area.  I told her I had a good one and wished I had it with me.  I looked on a nearby table, and there it was.  When I started to unfold it for her, I noticed that she already had one just like it on the floor.  I asked her about that, and she said it wasn't sufficiently detailed.  But I noticed that the side which was facing up wasn't the detailed side, so I told her to turn it over, and she was surprised to find that the other side was detailed.
