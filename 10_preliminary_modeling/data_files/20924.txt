There was a lot of mud around. I held a little baby in my arms. I was above the house and it was quite high. I bought some land like a farm. Earnest Dolpin and I were walking to work. I had a locker near the window and a chair to sit on. I looked out the windows and saw a colored man lying on his back and talking to a white man. He had a hard-on and I said he is doing that purposely so the white girls can see him from the windows and go out with him.
