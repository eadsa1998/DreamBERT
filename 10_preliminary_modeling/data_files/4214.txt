["Protecting the babies and Howard."] Howard is in the bathtub with 2 newborn babies. I don't like the way he's taking care of them. He lets them slip off him under the water. Howard leaves and I get in the tub, naked. Arthur, Ellie's friend) is in the tub, relaxing. He watches me as I hold the babies on my big belly. I arch my back, making my belly look bigger to keep them above water. They sleep through it all. Arthur is mildly excited about my bare breasts. I am mildly embarrassed about my fat belly.
