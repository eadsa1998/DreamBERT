I was working at the SXDS Regional office because there was a district manager's meeting. All the district manager's were in town and were staying at what seems to be a hotel. Gary S was there. Gary S was sitting to my left at a table for four. We were innocently bumping each other's feet and such. he reached under and touched my knee. A little bit later I reached under the table and rubbed his thigh. We knew were going to end up getting together that night, as soon as we would have a chance to be alone. Doctor C was there too, kind of in and out. I have no idea what he was doing there or what that was about. The place that the district manager's were staying, Gary S' anyway, was part of my house. When he came in, he was surprised at the changes that I had made in my living room. The house was unlike anywhere I have lived in waking live. It was kind of similar to my living room now, but it was larger. It was almost large enough for two living rooms, because I had several sofas in there and different things.
