 A family friend, Steve Lorenz, makes fun of my friend Matt Yams. His mocking is relentless tormenting: childish joking. They are then grown up, and Steve is too big for Matt to beat up. I'm by the overpass on Main Street where the railroad tracks are in Oak Valley. I'm on a bicycle. It's dark out and I'm not wearing a helmet. I ride very fast, weaving around cars. I ride east down Main Street. It's a fast and dangerous ride. I come near train tracks and skid to a stop. I fall off the bicycle and onto the tracks. A train is coming! I quickly roll out of the way, and the train booms right over/next to my head! I write the names of Elaine and Christopher ____ (I forget) Kraemer from the television show Seinfeld. There are some large three-kilogram buckets of tar. There is a reading room where an article is. I wait in line with a woman. She says that it's good to get the article early.
