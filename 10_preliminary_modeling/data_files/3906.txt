["Baby in crib and gangsters."] Howard is piloting an airplane and I am on it. He is trying to get it up higher. I see the plane in a steep assent. He tries hard but can't seem to get it above the telephone wires and trees. Finally, he gets up in the sky. Now I am in a hotel room, sleeping. I wake up and get up to see where Howard is. I find him in the bathroom, just finishing going to the bathroom. I come in, because I have to go. I hope it isn't already stinky there. It isn't. I notice a window a d look out it. I see an enclosed courtyard, empty except for a crib with a baby in it. I open the door and say baby talk things and them come in, closing the door. The baby cries. I go into a smaller bathroom and sit on the toilet, having a bowel movement. Howard is talking. I come back out and a woman says Gangster families often lived close together like across the courtyard to protect each other. Even when the family feelings of love are gone, they will do that.
