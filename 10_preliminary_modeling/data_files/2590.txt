I am going to meet a woman. I have to give her some information from the counseling dept. I drive out to a building and part in the parking lot. I go to the building house where I think she is and knock on the door. No one answers. I see what I think is a mail man pouch and a dog is biting letters and holding them in his mouth. I am concerned that the woman will need those letters. I see it is a back pack/mail box. The dog's head is shaped like the point of a fountain pen. [It is a waking realization.] He's black and white. I try to shoo him away but he "doggedly" stays there. I don't want to be bit, so I don't grab for the letters. Now I see women coming out of the building and I notice I was at the wrong place. They had been meeting in another building behind the one I was knocking on. I see co-worker Juliet and others. I am supposed to deliver this in for from the library (the community college) and I can't remember the name of the woman I'm to give it to. I go "upstream" as the women come out and find the second building. I see another meeting going on and ask a woman (a co-worker) if this is the OCA meeting. She says no, they had been meeting in the other building I feel frustrated and go back to the original building I am in the small room I'd been knocking on and think this must be a telephone room. I go outside and walk to the parking lot. I see a dead, bloated horse lying in front of my van. How awful, but I can probably get around it. Then I see my van, which had been parked with both doors open, was gone. I'm tired and annoyed; I call the police. A male voice says," You can drive a manual shift?" I say, "I can drive very well. But it's an automatic shift." He hems and haws and I know he is not going to be helpful getting my van back.
