In this dream my father was going to take a group of us for an airplane ride, including my sister (23), my mother (52), a girlfriend of my sister's (23), and myself. Much of my dream seemed to be composed of an argument I was having with my mother. She wouldn't allow me to go in the plane, and it seemed to have something to do with the kind of shoes I had on! She told me that if I went I would be killed. I remember feeling that I was being persecuted, and my sister was allowed to go while I wasn't.
