I was at school, which was different and we were sleeping there. I was next to Calvin and some girl. We had to be inside by a certain time or we got in trouble. The girl and I were outside and we went to the toilet. I waited outside for her and then we went back to the school and then I realized I needed to go to the toilet. I asked the teacher and went back. There was 'platinum' toilet paper. People worked in the toilet. I went back and there were little pineapple lollies. We ate them. I had photos of Eugene. We had both been stuck somewhere and I had saved him but he hadn't spoken to me at all. There was some guy called Piggy and a friend of his died. He said that if he died he'd only be remembered as 'Piggy'. But he had helped me through something and I thought I'd remember him for more.
