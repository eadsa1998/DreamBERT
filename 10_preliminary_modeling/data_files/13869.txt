This girl and her boyfriend ended up with this dude. I don't remember properly, but Pete Wentz was in a van along with them and the guy's sister. It was then dark and Pete and the sister disappeared. They were trying to find the guy's sister. They went through McDonald's drive thru, but the van was too big so they went back and got a smaller car. Then they were at the guy's house. The girl had now fallen in love with him. Her boyfriend was going through all these trapdoors trying to get out and to find the guy's sister. His girlfriend and the guy were trying to kill him. At one point the boyfriend came up through a trapdoor and his girlfriend pointed a gun at him. Then they were in an underground place that looked like an abandoned Royal Show and they were near some show bag stalls. All these people that the guy had killed were hanging on hooks with posters of them next to them. Pete Wentz and the sister were down there. It had then been a movie, and Dad said "he wasn't there earlier", as he had thought Pete Wentz hadn't been in the movie at all.
