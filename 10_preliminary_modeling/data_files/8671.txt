This dream was about the paradox of fear and love. There were several circles. I know at least two but maybe three. On the perimeter of each circle were 8 points, all equally spaced from each other. At each point there was an image that I can best describe as an exaggerated Hershey Kiss. or a teardrop with a tail on the top. Based on some information I am repositioning these flames. always keeping them at the same points on the circles but trading one from one circle with one from another or trading them within one circle. Now there is just one circle and based on the information I now have I am trying to determine if I can appropriately put a flame on the circle and I decided I can definitely put one on it, but can't decide about more. Then there is another circle and the same thing happens. Now I'm thinking about these last two circles.
