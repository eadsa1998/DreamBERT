I'm a sexy dancer. I dance through a crowd of me and see another professional dancer (10 cents a dance type) across the room. She's seated, resting, and I decide to do so also. A black athletic man comes over and talks. He tells me about how he'd have to walk home after ball practice. His coach wouldn't let him take the school bus. I sympathize and say nicely, "Well, you get good exercise, eh?" A man is watching me, interested. I write in my journal about what has happened. I comment that when I came through the crowd, I saw all kinds of men -- short, tall, fat, thin. Each one was different. I say, "And yet, each one so similar." I dance "dirty dancing" with men. This older professional guy watches and enjoys my movements and my conversation. I keep an eye on him too. I am attracted.
