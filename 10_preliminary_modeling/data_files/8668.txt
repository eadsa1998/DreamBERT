There were quite a few people and a lot of information on one or more Excel spreadsheets. I think I woke up probably ten times during this dream, for just seconds, and then went back to sleep and the dream continued. I'm not sure if I really woke up though. Each time I thought about the dream and was trying to figure out what we were doing with the sheets or what we were supposed to be doing with them. So, I don't know what sleep state I was in when I was wondering if the row labels on each sheet were the same, if the column labels were the same or neither. At some point I finally decided that we needed to combine all of the information onto one sheet. I know I at least decided the row labels were the same but I can't recall if I made a decision about the column labels. But since there were so many people working on this and so many different sheets I was concerned about how we were going to accomplish this, and/or the best way to accomplish it.
