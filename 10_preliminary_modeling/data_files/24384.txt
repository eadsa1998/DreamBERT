There was this tight circle, and there was this really little girl. I was standing next to my mom. A guy with straight dark hair was behind us, and he had a gun. I was frightened. I ran away. Then this lady told me to go up these stairs. They were really steep. I went up there. A little while later the mother and the sister went up those stairs, and they found the skeleton of the little girl.
