I don't remember how or why the way the dream started.  It was dark.  On a bus going "away" from where we'd started.  We reached a dead end- a large puddle.  So we stopped and got out of the bus.  I looked at the puddle.  I moved a branch sitting in it, flopping back and forth.  I was distraught for some reason.  My brother Stuart started driving the bus back.
