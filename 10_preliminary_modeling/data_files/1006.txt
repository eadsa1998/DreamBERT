A man wants me to walk with him. He says he's got a pretty weird family. He lives in a grave yard. I start to walk up some stairs. He's walking on air, on the outside of the stairs. I look and his feet are melting into the stair at each step. I say, "Who do I hear talking?" He says, "It's me." I say, "No, I hear someone on the other side of me." I get a feeling there's an invisible person on my left side.
