 There is a man with a sickly son. The man says that he has to work so he has money to support and help his son. Another man hears him say this, and instructs the first man. He says that the first man is going about it all wrong: what the sick son really needs is his father to be with him. I'm on a bus with the two men. We ride around a lake to a grocery store, which seems to be very Flanders-esque, from the television show the Simpson's. A son of the second man gets off the bus as it stops. He pushes a button at the bus stop, signaling the driver that we want to get off the bus. The second man and his (healthy) son seem to be Flanders-esque, unlike the first man and his sick son, who do not.
