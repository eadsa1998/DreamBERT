We were discussing race results. I asked who won the big races in San Anita today and I was told the name of a horse I can't recall now, but the other race the F. Field won and the fellow said that was a strong field. A stranger was walking by and overheard us and said, "That's like when Snowman was running again. I was playing him on the last few races and one of my buddies said, 'Hey friend, your Snowman is running again. You better put a bundle on him,' and then he said, 'That's like throwing your money away,' but I took his razzing and played him that day and boy, did he pay a bundle." I saw or heard Nobe Sun at sunshine.
