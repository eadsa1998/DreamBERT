I was walking along and a small boy was ready to kick me. I got angry and said, "If you do, I will knock your block off." He was afraid of me and didn't do it. I followed him into the bakery and when I was in there, I noticed I was in the wrong place. It was no bakery. It was a private home. I told the lady what a brat the kid was. He was ready to kick me, but was afraid when I threatened to hit him. I heard backfire. I looked into the toilet and saw a sheet of newspaper.
