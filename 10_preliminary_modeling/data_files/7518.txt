I am in bed with Mary, lying on top of her. I am making love, or trying to make love, to her. But Mary is uncomfortable and unhappy and finally tells me to stop -- that she is uncomfortable, and what I am doing is bothering her. I stop. But I'm unhappy and we have an argument. I am mad at her because she had allowed me to start and to continue making love to her even though she was uncomfortable and not enjoying it. I would prefer that she tell me immediately when she's not comfortable rather than let me continue while she's not a willing participant in the act of lovemaking. The next scene is outdoors. We are shopping, for what I don't know. It is a foggy night. I am walking ahead of Mary and she is quite some distance behind me. I know I should be with her -- at her side. I don't know if I am annoyed at myself for walking so far ahead of Mary, or annoyed with Mary for walking so far behind me. It is not just annoyance I'm feeling. There is in me, also, an element of fear or apprehension for Mary's safety. I turn a corner to avoid being hit by a car. Then I enter what appears to be a store. I think I had to go down a flight of stairs to get into the store. That's all I remember.
