At a resort. Again with J. and able to go upstairs to his room. Wild embrace. He cries. Then we collect ourselves and go downstairs together. See my friend Lucinda (college friend). She tells me she is in love with another man. I tell her about J. and encourage her to go ahead and enjoy it. Shift: I go with Lucinda to her place for supper. Have to sit in a narrow booth-like place next to the crib of her second child. Funny looking baby. At three months he asks to be turned around. But he has colic and nothing works. I notice that he has two breasts shaped like two penises! I hypothesize that it is due to a hormonal imbalance. We finally finish our meal, but I realize that I have left Marita at home. Panic. I rush to my car but after a stretch the car breaks down. I am desperate. No money. Run as fast as I can. Try to hitchhike, no help. Try to telephone but can't dial. Remember how frantic I was as a child alone at home. Perspire as I run against time! Finally I hail a taxi. Tell the driver I will pay at home as I have no money with me. Reach home out of breath. Marita, with tear-stained face, is wandering aimlessly about. She falls into my arms and sobs. I promise never to leave her so long again.
