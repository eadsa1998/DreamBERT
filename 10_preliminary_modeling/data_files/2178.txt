Jake is very depressed; he is lying down and thinking of suicide. I come up to him and he says, "A part of me died last February." I say, "At least you have your health! I don't even have that." I then explain to him how he needs to make changes so his relationships with Valerie can continue. I put my hands together with the fingers interlaced and say their relationship is like that. He is good at lots of things, but terrible at social and relationship stuff and Valerie is the opposite.
