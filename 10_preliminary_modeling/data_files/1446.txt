I am in a house in Mexico. I see my father. He speaks Spanish! I help repair a hole in the wall with margarine as plaster. It looks pretty and I show it off. I go next door to the room I'm staying in and pick up my mail. Lots of cards and pretties from Chinese and other foreign people I had befriended before. I think, "It's a good deal to make friends with foreigners."
