Mom said that she was going out with this computer developer guy and Ezra thought it was this guy called Apex. She was showing Dad what street he lived on. He lived on the same street as Apex but she said something that made it sound like it was someone else. I went to some other high school for a day. We had an excursion. Mr Reilly was there. We went to this place where Apex worked and he said something about him and "Sasha have a fling at the moment". There were all these collages of Johnny Depp. I decided I wanted to go home, so I got up and left. My tooth hurt. I called Mom and she was being gay and wouldn't pick me up. People were trying to make me come back. There was this 'grab bag' game thing. There were lots of hats and one looked like a Ted (The Fast Show) sort of hat. I got a heater and a TV out of the bag. There were Pokemon around. I remember Slugma and Farfetch'd, who I or someone else accidentally killed. I had some 'snowbar' thing.
