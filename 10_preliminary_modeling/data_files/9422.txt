I am flying to L. City in a small plane and see a huge plane landing with nose straight down, almost crashing, but then sitting down gently. Shift: I am walking through corridors with huge movie ads; like a maze. We land in L. City and there is snow on the trees! but not in the street. I walk barefoot through the snow, carrying a paper briefcase. I keep losing things. There is no one to meet us (Marita and me). Finally, father appears and drives us home in a makeshift wooden cart with a small motor. We arrive home to find it terribly devastated. I am appalled. Don't recognize the place. Incredible mess--empty walls, clothes bulging out of closets, dirty unmade beds, cigarette smoke in the air, empty glasses and bottles. Father is lying in a stupor near the back door with his coat on, looks like a drunk. I realize it is up to me to fix up the place again and to throw out the slovenly tenants. If I want to live there, I must start from scratch!
