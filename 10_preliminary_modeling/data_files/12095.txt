It kept changing between Tiana, Fat Girl and Ezra to Samantha, Fat Girl and Ezra, but the girls found a hole, by sitting on it with balloons. They had dug deep and found all this stuff underneath. The fat girl was angry because I had said something like "You're cool and pretty". You could climb down the hole as there was a ladder on the side. I had to drive up this road to find them, but then it was a dude was driving up some road. His father was in this big area flying a plane in circles, on the ground, because of some accident. The father told the guy to move. The father crashed with two dogs except they turned into babies. The guy took his fathers shirt off and then they were alive.
