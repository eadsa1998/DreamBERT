Was in some sort of school fair and was helping set up something with several other people, though I don't remember whom.  My high school classmate Jeanette was helping at one part with some other people and they'd done her hair to say FSIZ which was supposed to stand for, somehow, one size fits all.  I passed my French classmate Briana a couple times and talked to her in French.  The people I was working with finished up and I went to another part with my father where there were people wrestling.  He had a ketchup packet in his hand and I didn't believe him at first when he mentioned them for the blood affect.  But then they started squeezing some, so I squeezed the one I was holding.  I got a little bored in watching and went to pick up a bunch of pens and markers I saw lying around.  I think they were using those too, because most were pink or red. <br/
