First I had some sort of sex dream or something. I can't remember most of it. Then I had a really scary dream; whenever I fell asleep I heard loud scary noises, so I'd jolt awake because I was so scared. When I finally did fall asleep (in my dream), I dreamed that I was on the train to the city with Hannah to see a play. We had to miss the first day of school, and I had snuck out. There was a long dinner that was really formal. The Weasly family was there, but everyone tried to humiliate them. Then we were on the train back to school, and Arthur, Ian, Julian, Andrea, and Conrad plus 100 other people from my high school were there.
