 There are two poisonous snakes that have a label on them identifying them as poisonous. There is a snake that isn't poisonous. One of the poisonous snakes is orange and black. My friend from Fishing Haven Jerry Parsons is there. He says a big poisonous snake just ate the cow we had set out for it! Now we'll capture the snake since it can't move.
