I'm at my Aunt Millie's. I look in a mirror and see a Bugs Bunny figure reflected from the other room behind me. I tell Millie, but she's not impressed. I look again and the figure has changed into a cute angel named Millie. She flies into the room I'm in and we smile at each other. She has a short dark pageboy hairdo and a cute round face. She's going to fly through the wall, but gets stuck because of some cellophane ribbon material, part metallic, that I had hung on the wall. She pops back into the room and I point out a bare space on the wall. I pull out a small, thin nail that might impede her travels. She tries again and gets through. Aunt Millie's husband is out back gathering up stuff. I'm supposed to dive into a swim pool and get the orange juice container. I hesitate and then dive. As I'm underwater, an invisible snake-like creature called a Heffalump curls around me and assists. It scares me and I'm told it's there to help me, learn to trust it. I tell it telepathically what objects I need, then I dive in and she gently creates a place for me to rest like a leaf to sit on and then she efficiently gets my objects for me. I am pleased with her and admire her powers and gracefulness. She is gentle.
