Aunt Sally, except it wasn't, wanted to do a dream experiment. She had to pick between me and Ezra and chose me, since I know stuff about dreams. Chef (South Park) was going to go to sleep and then I had to come in later and check whether he was dreaming. It was early in the morning and I was really tired. I said that REM doesn't start until 1-2 hours after falling asleep and she said that she thought it was more like 3-5 hours. I said to look it up then. We got on a computer and it said 3-10-250 hours. I said "who sleeps for 250 hours?". I went in and his eyes opened and then he pretended to be asleep. I told her he was pretending. Then she was Nana. We went outside and it was day now. There was a cage near the fence edge, which was near a road. She was going to put a bed in it for me. I said "can't I just sleep inside, like on the lounge?" and she said ok. I went to the back door of her house and people came from the garage. Ezra was asleep on the ground and he woke up and curled into a ball with a weird expression. Nana went to go in and they grabbed her. I ran to the sliding doors going to the lounge room and got in, but the guy had a gun and I only had a screwdriver and so I gave myself up and went out. Ezra and I ended up getting into a fight with them and they were all pointing guns at each other and we realized they were fake. Then we were walking outside and I was wearing bunny legs.
