We had to play these games. Evelyn, Calvin and I were on a team. We kept losing because they sucked. At one point we were on 20 points and some team had 70 points. One game was jumping on these thingies on water and collecting letters? Another one, we had to listen to sticks that made animal noises. We had to guess what it was. We got a Revenge Card. One team came across a big forest thing with bears.
