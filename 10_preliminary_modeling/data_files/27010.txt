I dreamed I was going out to dinner and went with some of my college friends, girls. We ended up at a restaurant on the outskirts of some town. It had a brown stucco front and several archways going all across the front. Over each was the name of the seven dwarfs and Snow White. Then there were three more door ways, or arches with names over them, but I can't remember which ones they were. We went in and ordered steaks but L-- was the only one that could have one, the rest were all gone. The rest of this part of the dream is a bit vague. Shortly after, I returned to this same restaurant with the boy I used to go with. I went out to the kitchen this time and took a steak out of the icebox to cook it myself. After this the dream fades again, but every time I dream of this boy I get great feelings of antagonism toward him and have awful urges to hit him.
