I am holding a playwright class in my living room. "Merle," like Paul of old days, is there, the only one to show up. He is nervous and wants to leave, but I think he's cute and want him to stay. So he reads his scene and wants to go and I keep talking to keep him there, saying that at 1:00 Linda and perhaps others will be there and will need him to read their scenes. I tell him in detail, slowly, all about my new play opening up soon to keep him there. At 1:00 Linda rings the doorbell. I stand up and walk past Merle, caressing his thighs from behind seductively. He is surprised and not too pleased.
