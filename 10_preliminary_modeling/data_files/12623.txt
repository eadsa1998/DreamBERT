I was at Samantha's house. Nana was there. Her family all had weird accents and I was hoping that they were Swedish so I could get them to pronounce Smultronst√§llet. One of her sisters was called Chelsea, who had died. Her ghost hung around though, turning lights off. They were Jewish. Calvin was there and we were going to go to Adventure World with Samantha. But she wasn't allowed out on Tuesdays due to some 'Passover' thing.
