My boyfriend Jeremy's mother Harriet was over at the apartment.  I asked her and Jeremy what time it was: 9:30.  I freaked, realizing I was late for school.  I was supposed to be there at 8:15!  Then I realized, no, I'm in college..it depends.  So I went and pulled out the bus/class schedule book, afraid that I'd missed the first classes of the quarter and had been dropped from my classes.  Thumbing through the book, though, I remembered I'd already graduated.
