I was watching a rat looking for food in some bushes in the daytime. Then a fellow and I took a walk thru a cave or coal mine with a light, but we didn't see any rats in there. Then later a fellow was with us and said he found a silver dollar in the mine. He had a small piece of it on his person. I had some bus tickets in my pocket and I noticed my pockets were deep and big in my coat.
