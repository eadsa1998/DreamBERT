I was in St. Joe. In had been, or maybe still was, pouring down rain. I was with someone but I'm not sure who. A man approached me and was very upset. His car was sitting at a business, I think maybe an auto shop or something similar. His family was in the car and being flooded. The people who owned the business wouldn't let him go to the car to save his family. I have no idea why they should even have a say in the matter. I tried to calm him and went with him to where his car and family were. I spoke to the owners of the business and resolved the matter. The man went to the car and was able to get the car started and backed out of the flooding waters.
