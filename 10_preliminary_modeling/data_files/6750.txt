I am hiking along a country road. It becomes a mere trail. Open my handbag. Miss billfold. It must have fallen out when I opened the bag a considerable ways back. Hurry back. Ask children I meet if they had seen it by the roadside. It has my name on in red tape. In rummaging thru my bag, find two $5 bills so I can not have lost very much. There seem to be others in my party ahead or behind me. [Since taking rauwolfia, I have many disjointed dreams every night which are quickly forgotten.]
