It was one of those deals where I woke up in the night and then slept really lightly. And I was hearing some music in the background. And the dream was that I was on this crazy thing that would, I guess I had the notion was made from the recycling cart, you know, the cart that I take to the store and to recycle bins. But it was a flat piece of wood with wheels and a lawn chair stuck to it. And I was riding on it, and I was rolling down the sidewalk, and actually, yeah, I could steer it by tilting my body a certain way. So I was rolling down the sidewalk with Big Bird on my lap, and I was rolling through the 22nd Avenue crosswalk, and apparently I had just enough time to reach out and push the button as I kept on rolling and rolling. And I said, "Gee, I hope the cars stop." And I was really scared about that. But I managed to roll through the street without any incident, and it was like I couldn't stop the thing, it just kept rolling. And it was rolling, rolling, rolling all like down the big bike trail that we take at the park sometimes, and I kind of leaned way far to the right to make it go like past the playground. And -- get this -- I was naked. I was in my underwear with no top, and I was at the park, and I had gotten to a nice sunny warm spot that I was going to sit down and just sort of take a nap, I think. And some guy came up to me and started talking to me. I don't even remember what he was saying. But he was saying, "Shouldn't you, what if you get cold? Shouldn't you be wearing more clothes?" or something like that, and I was so embarrassed.
