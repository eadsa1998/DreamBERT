I had like three things going on at once, and one of them was an AGO [American Guild of Organists] meeting that I wanted to go to. One of them was a class, and one of them was something else that I don't remember. And I was supposed to set up a cab to get to at least two of these things. I realized that it was after 5:00, and I had forgotten to set up my cab.  And then the scene of action in this dream was, I guess I was at the class and I didn't even have to go to the school. I was in my bedroom and it was a lot bigger, and there were like three or four other girls with me that I didn't know and we were supposed to be in the class. And this teacher came in and started giving us a lecture. She was making up talking points about how our water system worked. She was like making up this presentation about how they started running water through the city and through the pipes and up to the houses. And I was writing notes and papers. Everybody was goofing off. I don't remember _______________. It was just a dream about having too much to do and not enough time to do it.
