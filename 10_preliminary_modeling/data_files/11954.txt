I was at home in the office and we had heaps of computers and two offices. My computer was going crazy so I got up to see what the problem was. The light in Ezra's office was flickering and then it would go off and then it started giving electric shocks. No phones were working and we needed to get a hold of Mom. But then she turned up with a torch. We were at a cafe place. This guy kept talking to us about something and then his wife left him. Then these two scary old people wearing makeup made him and his wife some dinner with strange vegetables. Mom was saying how her painting was taken by Nana 20 years ago. Nana was like "move" and then took 'her' painting from a box. Some street name was Chollatel or something. At school we had to picture we were in a cemetery. Then, the teacher, Ms P asked me a question about using an 'ajouk' board. She meant Ouija board. We were playing a board game. We also talked about noses and I had a cold.
