I had the freakiest dream. I dreamed I'm on a raft with a beautiful Indian guy and a small child. We fight rapids, waterfalls, etc. Finally we pull up on beach (grassy, nice). I'm suddenly making advances (kissing, French) on Ginny. I had the male role. I said, "How neat, we can go off and do this any time and not have to wait for..."(I assume men). This was accompanied by feelings of repulsion, guilt, no sexual feelings at all.
