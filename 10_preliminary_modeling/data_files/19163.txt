I dreamed I was out with a friend whom I hadn't seen for a long time, a boy Eddie Book bounder. We were out on a double date or triple date. There were several couples and we had a picnic right along the Miami River somewhere. Eddie had this blanket spread out on the river. This was rather unusual. He said it wasn't so unusual for him because he could fly, and he did fly. He was flying along. We asked him how he could fly. He couldn't fly too high, maybe 100 feet or so. This was pretty interesting. I wanted to know how fast he could come straight down and stop before crashing to the ground. He could come down pretty fast and stop. We looked real close at the river, and he seemed to have a sand bag on which he had his thing on because the girl who was with him walked out on the blanket, and it didn't sink in the river. It was probably right across a sand bar. Hall: They were on a picnic, and they weren't in cars, but they were walking. Sam didn't recognize any of the other people he was with except for Eddie. Eddie wasn't lying on the blanket. He was just lying up in the air. It was kind of a swimming-like motion that Eddie was making to fly. The blanket was spread out on the river and not on the road. The blanket was actually on a sand bar rather than right on the river itself.
