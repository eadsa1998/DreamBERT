I'm in an auditorium. Susie S is concerned at her part in this disability awareness spoof we are preparing. I ask, "Why not do it? Lots of AB's represent us in a patronizing way. Why shouldn't we represent ourselves in a good, funny way?" I watch the video we all made. It is funny. I try to sit on a folding chair. Some guy in front talks to me. Merle is in the audience somewhere. [BL]
