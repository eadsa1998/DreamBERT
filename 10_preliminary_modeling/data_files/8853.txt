I was with Macy F. We had both gotten invitations to Jan F's graduation party. I was surprised and said that I didn't know she knew Jan F. We went to the party together. Jo V was there of course. I spoke with Jan F a little, but mostly with Jo V. I am back at the house. Deven D came with me to spend some time talking about my dissertation. He kept telling me how much better it is and that he thinks it is really good. We had been in the living room talking. He went upstairs to use the bathroom up there. As he was coming back down he turned and looked at me and began talking about the dissertation again. I was thinking about how different he looked, maybe because it was so odd to see him in my home. He was wearing Khaki pants and a button-down shirt. One of his front shirttails was hanging out of his pants. It was time for him to go and continued to try to reassure me about the dissertation, then gave me a warm hug before he left.
