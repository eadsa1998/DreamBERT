I went to this library that was quite far from home and I'd taken the bus there. Marvin was there and it was fairly busy. I went to the counter and asked if I needed to register to loan books and they said yes and told me to go in to get started. I sat down next to these people and Marvin sat next to me. We talked a bit, but mostly just sort of hovered near each other. I was walking around and went to the front of the library and saw a Goosebumps book I'd never heard of. I found more and they were from different 'series' of the books, before and after I had read them as a kid and that's why I'd never read them. I was excited about finding new books and wanted to read them but wondered if it would be the same to read them now.
