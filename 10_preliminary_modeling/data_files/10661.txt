Me and Polly were sleeping on the beach. The waves kept reaching us and waking us up, so I'd move a little higher, until I couldn't find a place to lay down where I wouldn't get wet. I was walking along the beach and the water was really clear, and I kept seeing black, small fish, always in twos. It was weird. Then my brother went up to the house, so I did. I went to go to the bathroom or take a shower. My brother was using the bathroom and I was naked and this ugly bum guy came by and saw me and came back. He started asking me if I was naked or not. I said no because I had a tye-dye shirt on, but no underwear. Then he started smiling and came up the ladder towards me and Kira said jokingly, "Better watch out, he could getcha!" I grabbed for my bathing suit and it was light blue instead of fluorescent orange. I put the chair on top of the ladder and ran out the back door (which I had seen my brother go out of) and screamed, "HELP!" and I saw this really rich house with a family and a swimming pool and people sunbathing. I ran down the stairs screaming help until I was safe with a man and his son across the street. I didn't want my brother to see me naked.
