Took a nap and dreamt of Christmas shopping.  I ran into my boyfriend Jeremy twice- he had his sunglasses on. I don't remember what the idea was, but I was going to take Christmas napkins and a small basket.  There was some sort of sex toy on the shelves.  I wanted to talk to my longtime friend Kip about going across the bridge.  We were in the kitchen before dinner.  My dad was wearing some sort of jogging suit.  For some reason I was talking to them in French.  I was about to ask about the thumping whenever a car drove by outside when I woke up.
