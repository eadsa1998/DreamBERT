I was at school and Calvin was sitting next to me and Evelyn. I was annoyed that he was. It was Wednesday. They said instead of Digital Media, we had English. I remembered that in Digital Media, Evelyn and been acting weird and had continued acting strange throughout the day. She was copying my voices etc.
