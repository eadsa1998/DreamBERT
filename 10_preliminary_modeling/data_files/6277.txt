I committed a severe crime. I forget what, but afterwards I was being chased. During the chase I got away. For a while I was just watching out for the police, but a person turned me in and police chased me. Gunned me down. I got shot. Ran while shot in the leg. I arrived at my house, but sneaked into my neighbor's house and hid in the cellar. Later during the day I was caught and awoke right away.
