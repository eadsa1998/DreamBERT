[1997-05-23] I was in bed at my parents' house and I had a cup of coffee and even some eggs and stuff I was eating. Everything was going okay and then a cat came up and he was walking around on the bed and I said "no, no, you can't have my coffee" I better get up, because this was no good. I had already had some coffee but there was still some in there and I walked into my parent's' kitchen and had breakfast with them which was nice, and I was having a good breakfast with them.
