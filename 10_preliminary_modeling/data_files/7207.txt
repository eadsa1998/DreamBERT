The blue paper was a form for nominating a new president for Simpson College as the present one had resigned so the paper said. I could think of no suitable person. I asked an alumnus if the president must be a Methodist. He didn't know. We then noticed little packets under certain questions marked, "Do not open." We felt them. Must be full of slips, votes of others.
