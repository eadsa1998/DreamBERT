       --I help CHRIS M. (from Morris &amp; Christie) to serve customers and also lift heavy sacks; spend long time looking for the right sack. When I look up, I see MIKE M. (our homeless person) and I lift up a newspaper before my face, so he can't see me. He looks back but does not recognize me; I am relieved. (vivid details)
