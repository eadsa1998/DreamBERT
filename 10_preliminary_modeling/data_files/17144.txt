I was in a hallway at school running from one side to the other, and a backward somersault to return to the other side.  I did this several times and quite quickly.  It was a badminton exercise.  I got dizzy doing it.  My classmate Carla was there, and some guy.  My French teacher Mrs. Barnes came out into the hall.  I got so dizzy I couldn't propel myself over.  I tried twice unsuccessfully, and ended up only doing 'the snail'.  I gave up.  I was taking the SAT9 in a classroom, but it was like the AP English test.  My lips got locked, like a cramp.  They were pressed hard against my teeth.  I flipped them over my teeth to try and relax them.  My mother was nearby a seat or two but didn't seem to notice my pleas for help.  The grandparents and family went outside to the car.  My lips had loosened some by now.  I got into the passenger side of the van.  Everyone else was in my mother's car.  We went forward.   It was too dark to see whom, if anyone, was driving.  The car was being dropped off for repair.  I heard some sort of recommendation regarding the pop in the right side of my back.  I saw a glimpse of a profile.  I thought it was my 9th grade English teacher Mrs. Mar at first, but heard someone say Royelle, my brother Stuart's econ teacher.  She hit something and I jerked forward.
