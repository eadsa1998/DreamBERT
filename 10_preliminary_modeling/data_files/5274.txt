I first dreamed that my dean and I were best friends and I always went to his house to hang out. It was weird. Then I dreamed that Charla and I were in New Hampshire at Granddaddy's, and she wanted to take a boat on the lake at night. I knew it was a bad idea, but I went out with her anyway. We were 20 feet out into the water when I decided to turn back, because I knew this was wrong. My father had been sitting on the dock the whole time, and was proud that I had turned back. Then I dreamed that Sue and I were doing track. We finished with our warm up and this guy came up to talk to me. He was cute, sort of looked like Dylan and Nicholas put together. We were talking and flirting, and then all of a sudden, we were back at my house. He was flirting with me while we watched a movie. His name was Kevin Laradin, which is a name I've never heard or read before. Then I woke up.
