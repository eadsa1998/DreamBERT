Jayson was still friends with Ezra. Due to something that was happening I agreed to hang out with him one night. We went to this restaurant/hotel which was near the beach. We sat on a high wall with food and it was actually pretty fun. We were talking and joking most of the time. It was the 22nd of January and he suggested I come drinking with him on Saturday. I said I wasn't sure and it was my birthday in a few days. There was a quiet moment where I looked around and I could feel him looking at me and I felt uncomfortable. We made a house made of matchsticks. The lights around the wall got turned off and he said 'I think they're telling us to leave'. It was about 10 or 11pm by this point. We jumped down and walked past the restaurant. We were outside but it was undercover. He stopped under this archway and I kept going and he said 'stop' and I said why and he said 'because I want to kiss you'. I said no but it was a no out of confusion. He asked why I came out with him and I said I didn't know. He came closer and we kept walking and he was still flirting with me. I got home and it was different. I was happy and I looked forward to seeing him again.
