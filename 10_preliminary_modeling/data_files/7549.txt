Mary and I are seated at a (banquet?) table with many people. Mary is on my immediate right, and on my immediate left is a young boy of maybe 10 years. When I am served my plate of food, the young boy grabs my spoon to use as his own. When I turn to him and reprimand him for his behavior, Mary bawls me out, accusing me of making trouble. The scene shifts. I am in a large building -- a hotel -- but I can't find the elevator. I go over to a woman in one of the small shops in the hotel. And when I ask her where the elevator is located, she laughs and turns to another woman and tells her what I had asked for. They both think it's a good joke. Earlier in the dream I'm in some kind of job where I work on shifts and my boss or supervisor informs me of the times when I begin each shift. Although I am on time for my first shift, he seems to be taking me to task for being late for that shift. In that part of the dream where Mary is seated on my right, I can't see her clearly because I am giving my attention to the boy on my left -- but I know it is Mary. And she is certainly angry at me.
