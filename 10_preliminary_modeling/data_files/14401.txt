I was on the net. Uncle Vic had an email and a site which we had. I found a site that I had signed up with and had added a Preston Garfield. There was a picture and it looked like him so I figured I got it right. I was looking at the other pictures. His profile mentioned Hitman and Watchmen. It said he lived in Subiaco. I then had a 'flash' of if we had met years ago and everything would've been 'better'. Mom decided she and Darren were going to go out and she asked me if that was ok. I complained because I wanted to "shoot some 24". She said that I just watched It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. I think it was playing, or there was a picture of it, with Dee and I was like 'ugh I hate her'.
