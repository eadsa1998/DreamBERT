It was at my good friend's house which I've never been to. But in the dream her house was so big that I didn't even get to see the end of the hall. She had an Olympic size pool with fountains flowing with clear water. The house was in tight wooden color. I was very nervous as my friend brought me around the house. The butler/housekeeper gave me a cup of tea which I spilled on the white new carpet. I never got to see her room. I was so nervous that I woke up from the dream.
