There was a machine and people had to put rubbish on the platforms -- it rotated down to where it got dealt with. We had to leave a free platform between each one. Rob McElhenney was a worker there. Suddenly, a lot of chocolate came through and we were taking heaps off to keep for ourselves. We then heard police sirens. We discovered someone had stolen the chocolates, so we started taking the chocolates out of our pockets and putting them back on the machine. The rubbish was no longer getting off. The boss, who was a lady, said that the bottom machine must've broken. We went down and there was liquid. Rob and I had to go through it. He started talking to himself and acting odd. We got locked out the front of the place and I saw a dude with a balaclava getting out of a car. I went out the back and jumped over a fence, but they got me. I had my school books out and they made me put them all away. I put the pens in my pockets.
