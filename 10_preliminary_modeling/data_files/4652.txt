I am in a spacious kitchen. The appliances are fancy like you'd find in a wealthy person's mansion. I am looking at the garbage disposal, the label that tells you about the updates you will receive. I see bananas fresh and yellow in bins stacked very tidily. I am touched the kitchen staff has been keeping bananas there for me even though I can't eat them now on the Atkins diet. I see one that is blackening and decide to use the garbage disposal. I pull off the peel. The banana breaks in half. It is dry and old. I can't figure out how to use this fancy disposal. I now lie on the floor to figure it out. As I am there, a door opens and a series of disabled people with limps and braces and cp walk in. Everyone is dressed up for a party. They are in a party now, laughing and hugging each other. They are going to a room across the hall from the kitchen. I think about joining them. It would be nice to find a mate. Here's an opportunity. I see one young woman repeatedly intensely hugging a young man in a bright yellow suit jacket. I realize these are also mentally retarded people. She comes over by me. Now I am in my wheelchair. She grabs the handles of the chair and tips me back. I say, startled, Do not touch my chair again. Then I go off to the party room. I don't.
