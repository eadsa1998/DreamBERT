A detective man is attracted to me. There is an invisible bad guy, father, lurking around and we are trying to get evidence that he exists. Perhaps my brother Jake has taken some photos that show the shadow of the invisible people. He won't let us near where he has buried the evidence and I figure out where it is. The photo shows my "mother" having an affair with another man. My "father" is revengeful. I figure the information is buried in some boxes in the back end of the kitchen pantry room under the floor. I start to go there. The father pulls his laser gun and threatens to burn me if I persist. I know I must do it. I tell him, "You can no longer choose for me what I can know or not know. I must do that myself." He burns me with the red laser ray and it is excruciatingly painful, but I persist and fire back to him with my laser ray. We fight it out and I win. Now I am negotiating with the family, and the detective man who I love and loves me waits outside playing with the dog or a young boy, a younger brother of mine, waiting. Now I am going on stage to audition, singing with some already proven groups. I sing and hand my tapes to the woman who says that it's nice, but they have lots of voices as good. I sing for another group and then get together with the young man. We will do a duo and do it well.
