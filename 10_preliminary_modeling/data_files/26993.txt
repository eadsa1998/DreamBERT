I dreamt I was hurrying somewhere from work. Someone was with me, although I couldn't tell whether I knew the person or not. Suddenly we were seated in the balcony of the public auditorium. It was the wedding of one of my friends. (The young lady, age 21, will be married in two weeks.) She was dancing on a platform in a maroon and blue dancing costume. When she saw me she leaped up to the balcony and kissed me. The next thing I knew she was walking down the aisle in the traditional white gown.
