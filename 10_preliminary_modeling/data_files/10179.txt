DENISE (girlhood friend) and her mother come to visit; her mother does a lot of L/D phoning cross-country; confusion about time zones; she calls for reservations and finally leaves after buying some very expensive black fur mittens from a stranger; I am relieved that she is leaving; I continue being with my girl friend Denise as in the past.
