I came upon some friends and/or relatives who were playing baseball on a good diamond in a park.  I was going to join the team in the field, but to my dismay I saw that every position was filled.  Just then the third out was made, and they began to change sides.  I decided I would join the batting order and figure out the fielding problems later.  I had trouble finding my glove, and when I did find it, my fingers would get stuck in the wrong fingers of the glove.   After the game (I guess), we all had a big cookout in Uncle Jack's back yard.  Aunt Thelma stood out at some point for some unfortunate reason I don't remember.   After the cookout, we went indoors and played some game like follow the leader..  Later I saw a big picture of us which was to go in Life magazine.  We were all nude, and in a long, curvy line.  There were about 50-60 of us.  I wondered what Mother would think-but then saw that she was in it too.
