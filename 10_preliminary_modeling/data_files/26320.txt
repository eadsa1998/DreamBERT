 I arrive at Washington University with my sister Ramona. We're both taking a (different) class there. She pulls the car up the curb on the left side of the road. I'm wearing orange pants and a tight orange shirt. We get out of the car. She follows me as I look at the name of the building to see if it's where I need to go. The name of the building is ____ ( I forget). I see my classmate Bryan Beard, and he says we're in the same class. He is wearing a white shirt and black tie. We walk down into the building, which is not unlike McNeely Hall at the University of Springfield. I sit down in a chair in the classroom #100. My grade school classmate Gino Teavor comes in with roses. He is in a hurry to leave. I ask the people there if this is an Introduction to Psychology class. I slur my speech because my retainer is in, and I sound stupid. The woman professor says they call the class by a different name, maybe Cognitive Psychology. There are about 10 people in the class; almost all are women. I have a hair binder and an old beat up prickly black comb wrapped around my right pinky finger. One of the women behind me talks to me about this, and other things. I don't encourage her conversation, but reply briefly.
