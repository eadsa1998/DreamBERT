The government had a crew cutting down trees. I looked up at some of the trees. They were high, big. Someone said they would cover 900 sq. ft. if they fell. I was in tall green grass. Bob ran to me in the deep grass. I was drinking. I was putting in pipes. I looked thru the woods where I used to hunt. There were houses, homes on the other side, but they were vacant.
