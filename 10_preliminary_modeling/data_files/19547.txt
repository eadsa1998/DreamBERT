Along with 3 or 4 others (men), I am trying to get lunch at Woodward and Lothrop lunch room. The room is rather crowded, and I feel rather doubtful that we will ever be waited on. It is announced that all men must leave soon, as the women are to "have a little perfume." [Have no idea what this ceremony can be] One of our crowd (probably Marv) crawls up on counter. The man next to me, leaning against the counter, wears a nautical cap (with a bill) and asks me if I expect to see the boat races that afternoon. He describes the boats that have been entered to represent Washington, D.C., including a large of powerful one of 300 horse power. I answer that boat riding is detestable to me, and I believe one must be brought up on water to enjoy boating. Therefore one of our party points out some striking exceptions to such a theory. Oman and I each order a cup of coffee, and I get a piece of toast also. The waiter carries the coffee pot over to my seat and fills my cup first. After consuming the toast I am still hungry, and look around trying to discover what other food is available. Up to this time I have impression that the meals are free, though I notice the waiter marking "5 cents" after one of the items on the menu, indicating that one of our party owes 5 c. for this. Presently I order something like an omelet, which must be cooked on a sort of electric grill which already has a piece of toast on its top. However, the cook partly lifts the toast and slips the omelet into an interior compartment.
