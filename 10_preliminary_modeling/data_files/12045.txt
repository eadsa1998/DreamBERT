I was at school and I went to form as usual, but then I went to a dance lesson to get out of option class. Evelyn came too. I saw Michael Palin and his wife (Helen Gibbins) talking (they were our age). There was a voiceover saying that no-one liked them. He walked down to where I was, and I tried talking to him, but he was really quiet and shy. All of our classes changed and they wouldn't change them back. The dance teacher had really hairy legs with black hair.
