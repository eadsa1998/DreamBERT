The first dream that I remember concerned an experiment with butterflies which have a bad taste to birds, supposedly, and the imitators that really taste good imitate the noxious ones so that the birds won't eat them either. And in this experiment they had used hawks and presented these butterflies to them, and it was very quickly found that after having tasted a couple of the noxious ones, they wouldn't try to eat the ones that were their imitators either. So this experiment had been done and then for some reason they wanted to see if these butterflies really tasted good or bad, and so they had this med student be presented, not exactly be presented with, but eat a couple of these butterflies. And the one that tasted bad was really terrible, and he was real distressed about, and he couldn't quite understand why he was in the experiment. And so I told him all about the details of the other experiments to sort of comfort him, I guess, and then I rubbed his head for him because that made him feel better. The idea for it was from the magazine that's put out by the Museum of Natural History in New York, had this article in it about frogs being presented with the harmful insects like bumblebees and then with their harmless imitators, and how quickly they learned not to take either one of them.
