A "secret pal" came into my rooms the night before and painted lovely mural-like pictures on my walls. They aren't done yet. I am very surprised and pleased. Then Rosemary comes in and I realize it is her art work and she's pretending to have just dropped by. I show her the paintings, yellow in one room and blue in another, designs on the wall, sort of sketched in some places and fully done in other places. I am mildly curious why she chose to do this. It is ironic since she and I haven't spoken since the Mexico trip. Maybe it's a peace offering. Now I have a white dresser with a mirror on it and some pictures I want to take to the sidewalk "Saturday market" kind of thing to sell, only Rosemary has painted part of it blue; thick blue paint. I realize this will make it come down in value. Ironic, eh? Rosemary was trying to help. I decide it was never painted in the first place. The blue disappears and it is pristine white and valuable again. I get it down a full flight of stairs and onto the sidewalk. I place the paintings around it. Rosemary is there with me. Some young college age women come by and are interested.
