I was living in an apartment hotel and was attending a party in another suite in the building. When I left the party I was going to go straight down to the main floor in the elevator, but thought better of it and got off at my floor. When I opened the door of my suite, the maid and butler were just pulling a large bag full of stolen things through the hall to take it out the door. The maid rain away immediately but the butler remained to express his regrets that their scheme hadn't worked. I for one was happy it hadn't.
