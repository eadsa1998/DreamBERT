I was in the cemetery talking to my friend, but she had already been buried for quite a while. I couldn't understand how I could speak to her if she was buried. She answered me, "My soul is already buried, but my body isn't." I couldn't understand this and I thought about how that could be possible since I had written a letter to her for her birthday, and her mother told me that Mary (my friend) had died five months before her birthday. I awoke terrified to think this was real and when I realized it was a dream, I grew calm.
