I'm in a boat, large enough to hold about twenty people. We hear someone yell, "Help, help." We know the captain heard it, but ignored the sound. So we tell him and pointed to the woman in the water. He quickly made the boat turn in a sharp curve, perhaps in anger, and came close to the person in the dark water--it is and isn't night--suddenly I am on the shore of white sand or moonlight that makes everything white as snow. I said to myself, "It is snow except it is not cold, so it must be sand." The woman comes to shore, wading in the shallow water. The boat is not in sight. I feel the captain knew she was not in any danger. Others beside the woman walk ashore in the shallow water.
