I am in the wood shed in my hometown. My father comes in and says he has purchased this rifle, a 22-caliber, lever-action repeater that cost about $24.00. I ask where it is and he takes it down from the wall. It is a neat looking gun, but the barrel is abnormally short for a rifle and I doubt that it was worth the purchase price.
