I was with a group of children, some of the YMCA children, two of them I knew, others I was familiar with, the two I knew were Bill and Gina. The children were both male and female. We were walking on a nature trail with another counselor that was leading us. We came to this area where we had to walk through sawdust that was up to my waste. There were things hanging down from the trees and there were many spiderwebs. At first I saw no spiders and I thought it was fine to go with the kids there. Then as we were walking further I started seeing spiders. I had been walking through some of the webs and moving very slowly due to the sawdust. Also where we were walking was in a U-shape, so we really didn't have to go that way. At first I was just talking to the kids and not paying much attention, then as I spotted the spiders I became worried and wondered if we should go on farther. I then saw a huge web with bright green and orange colors on it. At that point I said to the counselor (who had turned into my mom) that we should turn around and go back, which we did.
