I was lined up with another group of men, all before a head monk undergoing questioning to become a monk. All the men in the group came from different countries and I was the only one who spoke English. The final question was a math question. After that we were shown our quarters and told not to do any talking at all. Pretty soon I wandered downstairs, picked up a Life magazine and started to read. The article was on the sadistic way the Russians killed their prisoners. Of the three ways the one I most remembered was the one of kicking a person to death. I then went into the head. When I got through I heard a woman say, "You are not supposed to go in there. It's private." I looked around and saw a bed with a very old woman asleep. I then realized I was in the house of a friend.
