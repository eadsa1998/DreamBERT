We were at Clementine Springs and we were at a little campground site, and we were walking around these various different trails, and it was real peaceful. It was Mom and Dad and I, and we were supposed to like meet somebody somewhere, I think. And Mom was setting up a little campsite. She was setting up some cooking and some tea and stuff, and Dad and I were going to take this little roller coaster ride type thing, and so we did. We got in line and we sat down on this little two-person roller coaster thing; I was behind him. And we started going and I had forgotten to fasten my safety harness, and I was yelling, "Wait, wait, wait!" but it was too late. We were already up in the air, and we like went up in the air off the tracks, and my little seat detached from his and it turned into like a glider, and it would fly how I moved my body and so I kind of flew it with my body. And it was really, really cool. And then we got to this, we were flying across this body of water, this little lake, and we were coming to the dock and I was able to land my little thing right on the dock, which I thought was pretty cool. And so we walked down this little dock bridge path thingy until we got to the little campsite that Mom had set up, and she was like hanging out some wet clothes to dry and cooking up some tea and all. And then I had a second little dream that she had prepared this poster thing, and she had found three or four pictures of Derek with the music major and me like as a little toddler of three years old with a scared look on my face, and then a picture of a guy (?) itself and then a picture of me 17 years old near it with a big smile on my face. I don't know why that keeps coming back to me in my dreams. That is just silly, silly, silly. [laugh]
