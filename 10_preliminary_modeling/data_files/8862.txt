I was married to Dennis Quaid. Something had happened that had caused major damage to the building we were in. Dennis had been injured and was unable to walk out by himself. I kept telling him to just lie against my back and I would drag him out. He kept saying no, thinking I couldn't or that it would hurt me. He finally gave in. There was rubble everywhere. I was stepping over rubble in a doorway in my effort to get us out.
