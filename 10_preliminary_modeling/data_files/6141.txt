I climb in my car and begin to drive. I drive for a while then I come to a toll booth on this road. I pay the toll and go on driving. Then I come to the same toll booth with the same man in it. I pay the man again and drive on, but I come to a U-turn in the road. I take the U-turn and drive for a while. Then I come upon another toll booth with a different person in it and I go on driving.
