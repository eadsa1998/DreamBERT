I was in a 7-Eleven, and my father's friend Marie came in. She said to hurry. I bought my gum and ran to the car. Our house had storm shutters and a storm cellar. Dad had already gotten food, clothes and blankets, and we went into the cellar. The hurricane hit and we were safe, though we didn't have power for a while. They named it Hurricane Juno. Setting: At my father's house in a storm cellar that isn't there. Characters: My father and his friend Marie. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, worried. I was really scared and worried, even though it wasn't a nightmare. I didn't know what would happen. I thought the house would be destroyed.
