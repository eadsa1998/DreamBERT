There was this person I knew who could 'call' water and control it. Some 'friends' and I were at this creepy place and there was a flood thing. My friends and I were only a few of the people still alive and we were at this school looking after some noob kids. Some retard chicken hatched. We left and I ended up at a shop place with escalators. It started flooding, and we all started running up, but I realized I would get caught, so I jumped down and swam back to my friends. The water girl also caused a little wave while we were walking. And there were people holding a meeting.
