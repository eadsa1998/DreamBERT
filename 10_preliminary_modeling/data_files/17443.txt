I was a young girl, with some developmental/mental deficiency.  I was in a bee costume.  In a black room, I was set beside a cage with a large cat inside.  I was being experimented on- they wanted to see what memories the cat would trigger.  It did, and I went back into the moment.  Something about crossing a river and being in school.  The second test was the more crucial one.  My dad used my 'magentelli' pencil instead of a magenta one like usual.  He drew a picture of a Pegasus, the wings out in front of the horse.  Then I was trying to gather all my pencils before being removed from the black room.  My Tuvan teacher drove into a parking area, like near the campus Health Center.  The end of the dream, I was trying to think of a religion that was not simply dogmatic, but something truly believed in, thinking a lot about Catholics, trying to think of an example.  Right before awakening I came up with Mormonism and the Amish.
