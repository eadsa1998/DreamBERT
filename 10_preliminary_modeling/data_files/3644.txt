Jake and I are traveling together. We stop at a motel. Jake is going to a conference. Some weird old lady who runs the motel chats with us. He looks at his brochure. Jake is very happy about the low cost and the great fun things he'll get to do at his conference. I seem to be along for the ride. The old lady shows us to our room and as she is still there. Several other people sort of wander through. A man on a bicycle cart that has video taped movies on it backs into the room. I go over and look for a good movie to watch. It would be fun to rent one, but they all seem to be boring or old titles and I can't find any I would be willing to watch. I say to Jake maybe he'd want to watch one of the old sci-fi ones. Jake says no. I notice he has blank write-in books there and say, "Oh, I have plenty." He leaves. Several other people come in through another door like they'd just come downstairs. Now the lady says something about the river in the back. I want to see the view. I go to the window and look out. I think I see the river and then I see it is just the highway. I look across the highway and finally see a pretty waterfall further down on the right. Then I realize the river is right in front of me, across the highway. I feel a bit foolish at not seeing it right away. Now the old lady wants to show me something and we see an odd elevator that has build in cubby holes where books and so on are kept like in display in a store. It goes up, so that a series of these displays are run past me. I see some ink pens and she says I can choose one. I try a couple of them and find one that writes in thick black strokes. I like that one a lot. I choose a pretty blue one and then she offers that I can have one of each color. I take the purple one also.
