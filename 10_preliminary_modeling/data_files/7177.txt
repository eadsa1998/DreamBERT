Mother, Mrs. G. and I waited for dinner at a bare table in the rear of the room. At last the waiters finished setting the table for ten at the other end of the room and we move up to take the empty seats on the nearer side. The waiter began calling out the items on a long menu, "Rice dinner, veal cutlet, chicken cutlet." I think I'll take the last.
