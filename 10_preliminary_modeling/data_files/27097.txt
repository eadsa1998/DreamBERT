I was in a car with my father and mother (both 45 years old) and one other person (perhaps my sister age 22 but I am not sure). We were passing a golf course. Suddenly my father started driving faster, explaining that he had seen a man just drive (hit) his golf ball and he was afraid it might hit one of the windows in our car. The next thing I knew was that the ball had come through the rear window and it hit me on the collar bone which immediately swelled up. Also much glass lodged in my neck. We started home so that I could be doctored. We had only gone a short distance when the bump on my collar bone disappeared and I seemed perfectly well....
