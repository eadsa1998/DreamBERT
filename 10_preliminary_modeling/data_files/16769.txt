I dream about Drivers' Education class. We were learning things like how to dial numbers on a telephone judging by the sound of them. The teacher had a big monitor with a huge seat- like a seesaw. I couldn't even see my computer monitor. I thought we were supposed to turn the computers off and log out when we were done using them, but I forgot. Then I've got this huge black bag (seemingly weighing over 100 pounds, easily) and we're going somewhere. Mr. Rosetti is there. Someone gives me 4 more bowling balls on top of what I already have. I give two of them away to a girl I now remember as Rita, and put the other two in a white plastic bag I suddenly have in my hand. We are heading for the Prep Academy, and I think I've forgotten something. I think it's lunchtime but it's only about 9:00 or something, so I decide I'll skip class to go get my stuff. I run up to the library, and this blond haired kid who sort of looks like Brian but is a little bit thinner, is there. I say, "Hey" and he smiles and looks up at the ceiling, waving, as if to all the "invisible people" up there. I start waving too, for his sake. Then I see some students from Prep Academy, who are looking for me, along with Mr. Rosetti, because they can't find me in class. Fortunately they are also looking for a girl named "Mana"- (Mana is one of my favorite bands) who is also missing. She's actually a girl named Helen but he called her Mana for some reason. I am about to tell Mr. Rosetti I am here, and I'll go look for Helen although I really still need to find my stuff. That might be the reason I'm turning myself in and offering to go in the first place.
