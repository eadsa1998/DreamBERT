There was a brother and a friend in Quantum Leap. There was a game, and I think the two guys were called Bryson and Peter. It was 1682, but not. There was another guy. He was somewhat hot. He got a car which was an ugly green, kind of ivy coloured. He liked it, but there was something he didn't like about it. I wagged school.
