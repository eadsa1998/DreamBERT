A nurrom the last dream hires me to cater a belated Christmas party for a handicapped client of hers. I agree but nothing goes right. I can't find my recipes, can't decide on a main dish, then it seems like there was a break and we are all living near an airport and a huge plane with a red, white and blue cross on it hovers above the house. I hide under a table. Finally it goes. Then my daughter goes outside to cross country ski and is pushed down a railroad track by a big plane. Some people are hit by a bomb or something and I can see my daughter check and then do CPR. I still can't get this party going. The house is a mess.
