I am all dressed up in a pretty dress. I walk out through a party with many people and feel shy. I continue through the crowd and walk down some stairs to a quiet, unpeopled place. I see a man, with balding head, but good-looking and in a white navy dress uniform. He likes me very much and I am happy to see him. We dance a slow, romantic dance and it is a passionate moment where I feel filled with intense love and desire for him, not sexual, but LOVE. He feels the same way, but he is being proper and not allowing us to kiss, even though I pucker up and offer a kiss. I want to be united with him forever and it's horrible pain to think he may leave me. We walk arm in arm and hug.
