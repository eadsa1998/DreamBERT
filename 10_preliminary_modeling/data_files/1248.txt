I hide in a cave. It's important to not eat the food. It may be poisoned. I move furniture. I put a wood framed mirror with maroon fringe next to the foot of a bed, then it is moved. I look for it. I go to the basement. Everything in there is mine. It is cavernous. 2 box boys work there and laugh at me. I meet someone I had written a book about. He laughs and says, "I'm not offended. In fact, I shall publish your book. It will help my cause!" I feel badly because it wasn't suppose to help them.
