In the dream, I was employed as a clerk in a large department store. As lunch time approached, I was anxious to get to the cafeteria, as I was very hungry. However, I was waiting on an elderly woman customer who couldn't make up her mind what kind of drapes she wanted to buy. She kept taking up my time all afternoon, so that I was unable to go to lunch at all. Finally I became so irate that I became very antagonistic toward the woman. She informed the supervisor, and he told me to be more courteous and wait on the lady. Finally she decided on the purchase, paid me, and left. The currency she paid me looked rather suspicious to me at the time, but I angrily went on about business. When the cash register was checked at the end of the day, the bills were found to be counterfeit. For some illogical reason the supervisor said that he was going to call the police to have me arrested.
