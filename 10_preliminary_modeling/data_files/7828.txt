Someone holding a baby in front of a person wearing glasses and the baby reaches kind of pokes at the glasses. I was Aunt P and Aunt H's house and I was watering their garden and flowerbeds. I had told them each that I was going to do that and to do it I was just going to let the hose run at a trickle and just let it soak them because they needed it so badly. I also had a fan out in the yard blowing on the yard or the garden where I was watering also. I was training to become some kind of a pilot. Anthony Edwards was my instructor and I only had about five lessons. The last one is the one I remember most. In that one, we were going to learn how to get height and how to go back down by pulling the handle bar or steering wheels toward you to go up and away from you to go down. Before my lesson, I got in a simulator and practiced. At first, I was terrible. I would go up really fast and down really fast. It was really awful. I practiced enough to get the nuance that by the time it was time for my lesson I did really well. After that, I found out that I passed, that I was now a certified pilot, and that I was one of the best in my class. I was talking to some of my classmates and their families about this because the husbands and children were there too.
