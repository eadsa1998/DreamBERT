The dream I had last night was of coming down a hill.  We stopped in somewhere and saw Harriet, my boyfriend's mother, making two cakes.  I don't know what happened, but for the scene I didn't want to see, my boyfriend Jeremy was no longer Jeremy, and Harriet was no longer Harriet, although they did hold their roles as my boyfriend and his mother.  One of my junior high school classmates Erika was there.  I don't recall how it started.  A knife flew at the mother from the son, grazing the cheek.  She threw one back, a box knife, embedding in the forehead. He threw one back, chopping the front right leg off a little poodle-like dog.  The dog was later okay, however, though still injured.
