I am going to a photo shop where I used to work. It is late at night and I am meeting Charla, a friend. Her car is halfway up the block but the building is dark. I knock at the front and no one is there. I go around to the back and am just about to go when Mike (friend) pulls up in an old green car and traps me in the corner of the building. Charla comes out. I suspect he is meeting her but we all pretend nothing is wrong. She shows me some old camera bags. One is faded red. We are now in a room and everything is dusty and dirty like it hasn't been used in a long time.
