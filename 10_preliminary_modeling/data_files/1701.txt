Engagement to Jack P. Three girls each dressed in white, lacy, long dresses come into my room. I admire their pretty dresses. Then their "mother" takes them down the hall to see their grandmother. She's asleep in her bed and wakes up. I see her sleepy face. She is Jack P's wife. I am packing and I pick up my engagement ring and try it on different fingers. I am engaged to Jack P, which feels strange since he's married. I notice the ring is very cheap.
