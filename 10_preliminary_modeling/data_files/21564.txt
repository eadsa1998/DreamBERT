Ann and I were exercising in the house. I looked into the mirror and my arms were big. Someone and I were letting my sister Ann down the steps. I heard 6 7 8 for Ascot that were picked by Lewis in the Plaindealer. I looked into a box that I was going to pick the winners at Ascot and I just got a glimpse of 7. Someone was or thing was glittering or shining into my eyes. Mother asked Judy, "Am I going to live?" and Judy said, "No, you are not."
