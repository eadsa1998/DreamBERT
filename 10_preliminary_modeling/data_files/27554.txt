In my dream I was riding in a large car. The driver was male and blond. That is all that I can remember about him. I was sitting next to him in the front seat and we were driving through the country. It seems to me we drove a very long time and then we came to a large body of water and we stopped at the edge. There was no bridge, and we couldn't get across so we just stayed at the edge of the water.
