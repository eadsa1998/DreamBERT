At one time I worked at a very large wholesale/retail hardware store and one of the men I worked with was named Bud. In the dream I was back working in that store only the whole set up was different and Bud was not a clerk in the store but a customer. He wanted a large bag of some lawn preparation, probably Scott's lime or something and he wanted to know the price so we started looking inside these catalogues and we couldn't find the price and so I told him that I would do some research and check around and try to find the price. The store closed and that was it. I went home I guess.
