I was a queen, and I was going to have my will read. I was descending a large, winding stairway and at the bottom stood a handsome young man lighting a cigarette. I do not know him in real life, but in the dream he was my cousin and my favorite relative. He looked at me and said, "Hello," but did not bow. I was puzzled. I entered a large drawing room. Several strange men were sitting there. I guessed they were my relatives. They paid no attention to me but stared vacantly into space throughout the dream. I stood in front of a fireplace. A lawyer arose and read the will. I left large sums of money to each of the men there, but not one of them stirred during the reading of the will.
