Someone is explaining the origin of a play -- i.e., how the last act included a fire scene. The play was based on some ancient tale, and was at first acted without the fire scene. One time an actor, in leaving the stage, forget to bring with him a bird or a small animal, which in my dream was named in several languages (the last one was in German and much more distinct than others -- I could almost but not quite remember it). If the animal was a mammal it seemed to be something of the nature of a cross between a dog and a goat, while the bid was probably a crow. A fire started on the stage and apparently the pet or pets were in danger of cremation. Subsequently, the fire scene was added to the play.
