I dreamed that I was in school and was married to James Franco, and that I didn't really realize it. All these girls were all over him, but he didn't do anything because he was married to me. But then we got into a fight because apparently we weren't having sex often enough. But I didn't even think we had yet in the first place. Then Ava and Jon were there, recruiting me to do some sort of skin research. We went to a fancy skin care lab to see how pimples formed and how to attack them. Then I got really tired, realized it was 2:45am, and decided to go to bed. And then I woke up mid-dream (within my real dream) to see that my whole body was covered in jewels. Then I woke up in real life.
