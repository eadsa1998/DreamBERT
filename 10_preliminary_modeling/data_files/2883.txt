Willie has died and I am attending his funeral. He will be visiting us during the ceremony as a hologram and I am very curious to see how realistic this will be. I sit up front and see three empty chairs to the right where high school friend Dora and Aunt Esther will sit. Behind me are the rows of seats for the others. Then Dora sits next to me on the right. Esther is wandering among the many people in the audience section and she is announcing that Willie would have liked us to dance to his favorite music. She puts on a 50's rock and roll record and we all stand and dance, me crying sadly as I dance. I see the hologram of Willie and watch his eyes for contact. Dora cries too. After two songs, we sit, and now each person opens the gift they brought to Willie and I watch and exclaim, "What's that?" to one man. He says it's a set of golf clubs. I see five boxes on top of each other, each one a set of golf clubs. Willie liked to play golf. I wonder how this is helpful, to give clubs to a dead man. Maybe Dora can sell them and get something she can use. I see I've given him one golf club. Now there is a small boy, a midget, really, who wonders if the tooth fairy is real. I tell him a story about how I waited for the tooth fairy and I saw movement near the window, like I was telling a ghost story or Santa Claus story. He is enthralled with me. I am semi-teasing him. His father says, "You really liked her story, why don't you tell her?" He turns bright red in the face and I wonder if he'll be OK, maybe have a stroke or something. Now he's a midget man. He tries to tell me he really liked my story.
