I was at Bob's house for some kind of a party. And even before that I was at the grocery store. I was shopping for groceries and it was a smaller store than Safeway. And when I went to check out, I had a couple of hundred dollar bills in my purse and I handed one to the lady. And instead of breaking it and giving me change, she was like, "Okay," and just looked at it and gave it back to me. It was as if, I think there was like this unspoken thing where he sort of initially took thirty of it, and then the next time I came, she would take some more, kind of like an electronic birthday card or something.  And then the next thing was that I was at Bob's house for a party. And I don't know, something happened. What the deal was, is Bob______ _________________ really nice and generous, and Diana's husband is like extremely rude and extremely selfish. And I felt sorry for Diana. Diana is so nice and her husband is such a jerk. But he was nice to me when I interacted with him and __________________________ really ______. So in this dream I think everybody was partying around and being happy and _____________ in Bob's house.

But Bob and Jason were like yelling at each other and Bob said, "Alright then, if that's how you feel, you can go back to your corner." And then I came out, and I went in this room where there was not one, but three or four or five pianos. And I was like, "Wow! Wooo-hooo!" And I was going to sit down and play, and at first for some reason, there were a couple of ladies in that room, and I was, I guess I didn't really want to get too close to them.  so I sat down at this upright. It had kind of a wiggly bench, you know, like the ones at the college that are not well kept, and it's like kind of dilapidated. And then I kind of had a little trouble getting started, and I was like, "Well, if they don't mind, I want to go and play the big grand piano." They were like, "Okay." And it was like _______________ biggest, like I don't think it was a 9-foot, but it was a 6-foot. And so I picked up the small lid, and I picked up the fallboard and I started to play Sweet Adeline, and somebody picked up the bigger lid. And, you know, in dreams I can never play.
