 I'm deer hunting with my roommate Stephen Ramos. I have a black powder gun. There is a deer way off in the distance. It was closer but it ran away from us. I took a shot, reloaded, and fired again. It is now really far away. I shoot and hit the deer, which is probably about 250 yards away. The deer drops! I'm surprised and excited. I run over to the deer with Stephen. As we get close we see two more deer. Stephen hits one and I hit the other. They both drop. We walk over to the deer. All three deer are close together. There is a doe and two bucks. Jake's buck has four points. I got a small doe and a larger buck with two or four points.
