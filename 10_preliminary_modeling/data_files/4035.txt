["Loss and comfort"]  I am seated at a picnic like table. A man sits on my left and a woman on his left. I am devastated by a tragic loss. A ship or airline went down killing hundreds. I am mourning for the families and loved ones of them all. The man puts his arm around me comfortingly. I hang my head and feel the sorrow. I decide I must write a letter. I get a paper and a pen. I put a sticky label on the paper and try to write my name Beverley. I keep messing it up.
