I can't remember properly, but I was out with Mom in the car. It was almost time to go to the train station but I wasn't dressed properly. We went to dads and he was there. I got dressed and there was a new pack of underwear so I changed into a pair. My timetable was dodgy for the day -- I had a spare hour between each hour of class. There was a sport thing too that was a high energy boxing like thing. I needed my lab coat from Mom's but it was now like 8.21am and I started at 8.30am. I think it was some time before, but I was going to bed. Tigger was in the lounge room so Ezra left the door open (they were sleeping in the same room).
