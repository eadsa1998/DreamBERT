Matthew and I went to Wal-Mart one winter evening. There was snow on the ground. It was dark outside. I was wearing gym shoes with no socks. I was pushing some of the carts in the parking lot further into the cart corral so they weren't in the aisle where people need to drive. They weren't in people's way so they wouldn't hit them or whatever. As I was doing that, Julie D walked up and asked me what I was doing there. I don't recall my response. She told me that I need to be at home. My CRHP sisters knew that I had been at home sick that day, that I had called in to work to say I wasn't going in because I was sick. I had been at home all day, but I wasn't sick. When I spoke to Julie D, I was trying to make myself sound sick. I went into the store and told her that I was there with Matthew, and would only be there a few minutes before returning home. That wasn't our intention, though. I sat and talked with her for a few minutes, sitting on a bench. I told her I needed to go find Matthew so I could get back home. I went and found Matthew. He didn't want to go. He didn't want to hurry. I told him that Julie D had seen me, and we had talked briefly, so I couldn't stay. I decided I could stay long enough to get some chocolate. I kept pestering Matthew about going home. I finally suggested that if I was going to stay I should be using one of the carts that is a scooter. That way if I ran into Julie D again, she might be more likely to believe that I am sick.
