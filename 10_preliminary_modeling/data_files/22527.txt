The second one was very vague. Suddenly I saw myself in a house and when I looked to see who lived there, I found a girl who in real life is a classmate whom I haven't seen in a long time. In the dream when I saw her, I didn't feel joy as one would expect (perhaps this is because she wasn't my friend). Instead, seeing her caused me to be surprised and we greeted each other by saying hello. I was always rather distant with her, especially since I got to know her better and found out that she wasn't good for a friend. So this is how this second dream went, as I said, very vague and not clear at all, the way I see it, because most of the time I dream about things that happen to me during the previous day, and I was surprised to dream about her because I hadn't even thought about her.
