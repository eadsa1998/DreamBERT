 A class photograph is being taken. I sit on the top row of bleachers where the "Hansons" and other "H" people sit. I sit close to, and in between other people. It makes me uncomfortable that we're so close. I'm then in the front row next to my friend Gino Teavor. Small yellow pillows and other things are handed out for the photograph. Since we're in the front it matters what we do with our legs for the photograph. We are supposed to hold hands, somehow. The camera is a video camera. There are many television screens that must be adjusted for people on the side of the group; the screens are turned. The group consists of students, and the people organizing this are students as well. Some physically big kids, who are younger than I, start bullying younger kids. The directors don't know what to do. I can't let this go unnoticed. I run over and confront the bullies. I reprimand them. They don't challenge me, but leave the younger boy alone. They have a difficult time backing down, though: they lose a lot of face! I'm in a restaurant type place with a couple others having a small celebration, which may be due to the victory over the bullies. I have my bottle of Key Lime Schnapps and pour it in some glasses. It's kind of milky, and I wonder if it has gone bad, but it is okay. A kid tries to take one of the chairs at our table. I yell at him, and he leaves the chair. There is an older man there who may be a good fighter. We fight. I punch him in the throat and he quickly falls down. I feel very powerful and in control.
