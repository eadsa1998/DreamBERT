In a house with several rooms, a procession of gay people interspersed with several imitation animals, elephants, dinosaurs, etc., very real. We had to run to hide from them. Then a man from the animal group got me and I was to be taken somewhere. I didn't want to go. A boy had a cord to lead me. I had an old lavender-gray wrapper on my arm. He took me past some outdoors toilets, three empty sheds with mud floor, three sides with wooden bench at back, all very filthy and odor of toilets strong, and lavatories. Saw two women in one washing up. Told me they couldn't go back right away. Tried to talk to guards but they couldn't understand. Taken to rear of toilets where I fling wrapper around me to protect good dress. Then we are planning to escape. Man is called to see why we women have started a fire to dry our clothes. There is a big log burning. He comes to see if it is safe. Sally and I start down a flight of stone steps to a large cement hall. We have to stay close to the wall so the man won't see us. I had put on my hiking boots before starting. I notice for the third time that the toilet odor is gone and think I must have gotten used to it. At foot of steps we turn to a brick path leading between very close walls into a second large room. Many are following now. I wonder why the man had been called making our escape more likely. Decide he is to think the women had to remove clothes to dry them so men guards wouldn't be there. Lose Sally. Hunt for her. Some one says there are some stairs. They are queer ones, spirally placed rods, mere foot holds. We climb up them.
