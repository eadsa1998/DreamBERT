I'm holding on to a long hanging rope. I'm high up and scared because I may lose my grip and fall and be seriously hurt. I'm shaking with fear. There are three other ropes. A man is on each one. This is a man's thing we're doing. They are distant but encouraging. In a final rush of bravado I swing, even though the twisting makes me dizzy and disoriented. I swing myself up on a high perch and sit, proud of myself and "showing off" to the men.
