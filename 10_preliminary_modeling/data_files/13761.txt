I was at school. Ms Madsen had stuff on the walls which were like medals and stuff that her students had won. Someone had got a gold medal for an essay on An American Werewolf in London. I was thinking I wanted a medal for doing an essay on a cool movie. Then I was at home and I had heaps of them from her (of all the ones she had got). I found one that I'd got for some games thing, which was silver. There was something about Meg Ryan. Mom was on the phone and I showed her. I was thinking about looking to see if Eugene had one. I had asked Mom to bring me food but she brought a coke and this disgusting looking burger. I threw them straight in the bin when she gave them to me. She came in and made a mess of this stuff I had, including sand. There was a photo of this playground covered in sand and Darren had taken it. I was playing GTA IV. On the game, the character had another girlfriend called 'little party trick'.
