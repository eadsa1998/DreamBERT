A group of friends from the neighborhood were standing at the corner of my house, waiting for somebody. We were going on a picnic. A week ago we had a picnic and while we waited in the dream, I had the feeling that things were being repeated. I was among my friends. I knew they were my friends, even though I didn't see anyone in particular. We were simply together. Suddenly Louie, who is known to all of us and, like us, is a member of the Circus Club, arrived in a car. His car was very dirty and he always has it clean. He is a boy I don't like very much, even though I don't know him well. We all got in the car, and I automatically thought that there were more girls than guys (in the picnic it had been the other way). I was in the back of the car. When I had thought that, Louie was changed into a girl and at that point my dream ended.
