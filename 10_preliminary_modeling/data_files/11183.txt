As I walked in the dorm, I picked up my mail that was lying on the mail table. Mother always writes on blue stationery, so I picked up the blue letter and proceeded to read it. It turned out to be for another girl in my dorm. The contents were so engrossing that I continued to read it after I knew full well that it wasn't my mail. It disclosed the fact that her older sister was going to have an illegitimate child. I felt so ashamed that I decided to pretend the letter never came. However, my conscience got the best of me and I gave her the letter. She flew into a rage and chased me around the house. I pushed the bed in front of my room door and awoke all worn out from running so.
