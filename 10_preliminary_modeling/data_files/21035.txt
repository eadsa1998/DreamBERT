Tony Lasko made a high jump from an airplane or I watched him fly thru the air and land on his feet. I wasn't going to look, but I did. I saw a toy plane from the amusement park glide around. I watched it as it glided on its side. I picked up a large red tomato and was tempted to eat it, but put it in my car. I looked it over closely and it was nice. G. G. bawled Chipka out. He said, "Now you tenants are going to use _ of the attic apiece." I saw myself in school and I saw a fellow that was there and looked like a fellow that went to school with me 27 years ago. I was thinking why I didn't go to school and have a good education, but I had a pencil in my hand and said, "I can make good with the education I have now."
