I had a dream that my longtime schoolmate Rina Gupta was failing to cope with junior/senior year high school English teacher Ms. Kraft.  Rina was quite a bit plumper than she used to be, and was crying.  I told her she couldn't give up because it would discourage so many other students, her always being at the top.  If she couldn't cope, how would the others do?
