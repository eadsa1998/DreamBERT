I dreamed I walked through a narrow street, with old houses, and I don't know why it seems to me now that it was Trujillo, because I really don't know Trujillo. The houses were full of people who were cleaning, especially the windows. The dust fell outside where I was walking, but it didn't fall on me. Then I remember seeing a green-covered book in which there was something in Russian because there was a backward "R", the way Russians do it, but I don't remember any more.
