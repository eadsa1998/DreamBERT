 I'm playing basketball with my friends Sam Kingsley, Tony Kramer, Tony Ramada, and others. I am posting up and Tony Kramer sets a good hard screen on my defender. I curl into the lane. As I do Tony Kramer says, "Please say its safe ___ inter shopping". (I forget the missing word.) I am wide open in the lane. I understand Tony's statement to mean that I can't be any more wide open and I need to score. He is using sarcasm, saying that if I don't pound the basket home something is wrong. When I hear him we all burst out laughing. We fall to the floor and roll around in laughter: it's hilarious!
