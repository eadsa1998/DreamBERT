The time was about 1 o'clock on Monday, October 17 and I was hurrying down the main corridor of Mather Ad Building to get to my Shakespeare class. Halfway there I met two other girls in my Shakespeare class. We started talking about the course and about the test that we were to have the following day. Suddenly it occurred to me that I had forgotten all about the test over the weekend and I hadn't studied at all for it. When we got to the door of the classroom, I stood outside for some minutes trying to decide whether I should go in and take the test or not. I had a very lost feeling and I retraced my steps down the corridor past an old high school pal of mine. I was now headed toward the library to read over my notes before the test. While I was in the library a girl asked me if a friend I knew was in my class. I tried very hard to recognize who the friend was and where she would sit in the class. I then returned to the class after it had started and took the test.
