I had a date with a boy (who is 30, a friend of a girlfriend of mine) for lunch. As I was going downtown I noticed that his pants legs swept the ground and his overcoat dipped way down in back. This embarrassed me. Then we went into a lobby to buy some theater tickets. This lobby was much like a small town railroad station. I was sitting on one of these wooden benches inconspicuously with many other people when this boy went up to the desk to get the tickets. As he reached under his coat to pull his wallet out of his back pocket, I saw that he had a thick corset laced over his pants. Everyone laughed. I sneaked out of this lobby and into another one. I was so embarrassed. I met another boy there who told me that he was a friend of this first boy, and the whole incident had been an initiation stunt.
