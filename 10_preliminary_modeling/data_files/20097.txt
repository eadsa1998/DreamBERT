I was seated in an auditorium. I changed seats with a patient on the ward named Farell. Without saying anything, he touched my chest, then hugged me from behind. Later I had a kite. The string fell into shreds when I tried to unravel it. I looked for some string, and found a box full of string that was used to tie printing forms. It was on a paper cutter.
