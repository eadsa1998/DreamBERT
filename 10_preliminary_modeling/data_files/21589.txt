I saw gloss color picked to win. I saw leader as winner. I saw a newspaper and the headline started Admit one Cent and I awoke. Ann and I were driving down a road. We came to a road. It was so steep. I put my brake on and I held onto the sides and let the car down slow. When we came down, I looked up and a girl was coming down in her car slowly. It was about 95 degrees steep. I saw Uncle Jake with his high power rifle in Shinnae hunting ground hogs. When he walked by, I saw a fox stick his head out of a hole and then come out. Rubber was flooded over the land and we were shoveling, digging it and hauling it back with wheelbarrows.
