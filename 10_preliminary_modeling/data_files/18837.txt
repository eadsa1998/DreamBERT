The scene was a room (?) in which I was with three girls who I knew from someplace or another. I was checking the mail as to whom it was for. I remember reading some address on a letter and making some comment about its receiver and shaking the letter up and down. It was a long, flimsy, brown enveloped letter. About this time a girl came in who wasn't particularly well thought of by the group in the room. Her name is Peggy and she was a camper at the camp I worked at this summer. The girl seemed to ignore her presence and I said very little myself. [Joy, both pleasant and unpleasant, brown envelope]
