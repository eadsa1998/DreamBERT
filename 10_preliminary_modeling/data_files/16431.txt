Mom and I were coming home from a trip to Jackson and we were outside the airport and Josie and Bobby and Aunt Christine and Uncle Larry and her and I were opening gifts. And the plane was like going to leave in five minutes. Then it came down to that we missed the plane because we were opening gifts, and I figured, "Okay, we're just going to have to stay in Jackson for a few more hours until the next outgoing flight." And that was kind of good because we could go to somebody's house and stay a little longer. Well, it just so happened that -- I know this is very unrealistic -- but Dad drove all the way up from Westportrsburg because he somehow found out that we missed the plane. See, we were going to tell him that our flight was cancelled, but somehow he found out that we missed the plane. And so he drove up and he was going to get us and bring us home, and he was mad, mad, mad at that old red hen, hen, hen. [laugh] And we also missed the Bryan Adams concert and I was jumping up and down and saying that, "You have to take me to an equivalent one." Something else, but I can't remember. And that's basically it. When I was waking up and realized that all this was a dream and that missing the plane was a dream and the concert was still on, I was real relieved.
