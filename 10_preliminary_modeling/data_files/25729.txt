 I'm walking on 1st Street in Oak Valley near the Blackstone's house. My clothing is in their driveway: my two hats and some sweatshirts. I tell the girl there they are mine. She doesn't believe me. I say I can show her a photograph of me wearing the hat: I have one of my brother Wally and I at Brimson where I am wearing the Milton hat. She has a Milton hat too! She says okay. We walk back to my house. We see two of what look like UFO's on the walk back. They are bright lights outlined in the sky that fade into the distance.
