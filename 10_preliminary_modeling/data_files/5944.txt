I am walking in front of the UN building in NYC and over the inside walkway are three huge billowing balloon-like canvas awnings. They are high and bright red and orange, and I marvel how well they protect the pedestrian and add to the staidness of the UN. I walk into the Delegates' entrance and suddenly realize I am wearing a red and white vertically striped turban-like hat. It is a rather startling item and people all stare. I rather enjoy the attention and feel the hat compliments my new dark cashmere coat.
