There was this woman walked in, oh, it was me. That's right. I wanted to watch television. It was very late at night, 1:30 at night I think. So I was changing channels. There were about 2 channels that had late, late shows. My mother was there. She was going to bed. This friend kind of passed through. He didn't play much of a part. They both thought I should go to bed, and I wanted to watch television, so I tuned in this channel, I adjusted it. This woman walked in. She had money in her fists. She had just gotten up evidently in the morning. She looked and like on the table was a letter, an envelope, sealed. She picked it up. She looked at it and it said something like Peach Place in New York, and she had a look of surprise and I forget the words, but in other words, "Boy, that sure was funny!" Some old, stupid people addressed a letter to what must be her husband's business or something so that her husband must evidently be a real nice guy who gets into personal relationships with old, stupid people who then send them money to Peach Place, New York. But anyway, it arrives and she opens it and there were 2 dollar bills which she placed in her fist with the other money she had. Then her husband came in, and I could tell they were evidently getting a separation or divorce. That's why she was getting all the money. He was going to leave her his business. So then he said, "Would you like a candy, dear?" and she said, "Yes, sure, let me have one of those, do you have any of those green ones? The butterscotch?" And I knew that was a real sore point between them. Those green ones, the butterscotch, that was something, some recurring argument they used to have. He said, "No dear, I don't. I can give you lemon or one of these white ones." He really was nice about it. She felt a little bad then, that she wanted the butterscotch. So she said, "Ok, I'll take a white one." That's about it.
