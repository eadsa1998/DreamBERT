I win a CONGRESSIONAL MEDAL OF HONOR for having run x number of miles on a difficult course. I see our priest (Fr. G., not Father Andrew) at the back door of our house; He holds the door open for me! I say "I feel really good these days; I feel the Lord has FORGIVEN me a lot; really forgiven." "You look good these days"
