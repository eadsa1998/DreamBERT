I am walking down a coast highway in the dark. A woman dressed in the 1950's bouffant hairdo, petticoats and white heels is walking right in the road. We call to her, "Oh. Miss, excuse me, Miss!" She does not respond. Then she's in her car but there's no lights on. We call again. Then she gets out and lets the car go on without her. We hear it crashing. Is she crazy? I run into the dark and then someone turns on flashlights so I can see. I catch up with her. I realize she's deaf and I try to speak in sign language but I don't know enough. She's very upset and I realize she's doing all this in a panicked attempt to get to the hospital before 5:30 because if her friend isn't removed before 5:30 it will cost $232 or $238 more for an extra day and they can't afford that! I reassure her the checkout time is midnight. She is relieved.
