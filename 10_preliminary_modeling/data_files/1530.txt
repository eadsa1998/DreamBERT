I have a small kitten. I put some milk into a bowl for it. At first, I have trouble finding a bowl. I don't want to use the three we always use. The kitten lunges for the milk. It is so thirsty. The bowl changes into a crocheted doily and the milk sinks through. Then I see a movement like a snake moving off a chair and then I see a rat sneaking up behind the cat and it's going to bite it. I throw something at it and approach. It runs out the door. I follow and slam the door shut to scare it and then I open the door and peek around. The rat is now a man. I call out to the door guard to watch out. Another man walks up the stairs and I don't want him to go any further until he's been checked out. Then a snake-like column of smoke or fog moves through the stairs.
