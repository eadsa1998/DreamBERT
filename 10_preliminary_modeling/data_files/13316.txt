Dad, Ezra, Payton and I went to this restaurant/stripper place. It was full of half-naked guys and I was like 'ew'. I was thinking that since Payton was gay he would be happy here. There were two mystery meals so we got them. Mine had garlic prawns which were yuck, and Payton got this nice chicken thing.
