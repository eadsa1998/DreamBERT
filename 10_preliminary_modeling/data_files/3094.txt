Valerie is very pregnant and we are talking. I am stirring something I am cooking for the little girl. It is boiling and frothy. I decide to pour in some cold water and when I do, the level of the froth sinks and it is now just a small amount of stuff (like oatmeal) on the bottom of the pan. Valerie is now very upset with me. She says this will cause her to lose the baby. She thinks I did this to make her lose the baby, the metaphor being her belly all big and round then becoming flat and empty like the concoction in the pan. I am sad and cry; I beg her to believe me. I didn't do it to harm her baby. I was trying to make this good thing to eat and it just worked out that way. I put my hands on her arms to reassure her. She pulls away from me angrily. I cry and cry. I follow her, begging her to believe me.
