I know Mary is in this dream, although I have no clear view of her at all throughout it. We are living in a very small, cramped apartment, house, or flat -- I can't tell precisely what type of dwelling. Mary has prepared a meal for me -- it is on a large platter. It consists of lettuce and what appears to be filet of sole. But I can't find the time to eat it immediately after it is prepared for me. Some time later I find the time to eat and I look for my meal. I find it on a table or (?) in a very small room, the size of a pantry. When I see that the meal is fish and that it had been standing for some time, I choose not to eat it, fearing it might have gone bad. I take it over to the garbage (waste) container in the kitchen. It is difficult to open the lid of this container because it is wrapped up in lots of plastic (wrap?) in order to keep the place as clean as possible. Then, when I try to get something from the cutlery drawer, this too is protected with lots of plastic coverings. Somewhere in my mind I think Mary is "crazy clean." There is a brief instant where I have a conversation with Mary. I say that I think she is not happy with this place where we live. I can't remember what she answers, or if she answers me at all.
