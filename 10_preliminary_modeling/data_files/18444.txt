Now I am watching the actions of a man and woman, although I have no definite identity. This man and woman are on the surface and they have some special relationship to the child. The child has remained below the ground, in the temple, and is venerated as a saint by the local people. There is a huge line at the entrance to the caves, people wishing to go down so that the child may bestow blessings upon them. There are large piles of white gravel around, of some sort of significance, as if each blessed pilgrim had added one to the pile or something (which would make for countless thousands of pilgrims). The couple despair at the sight of the long line, but somehow they know to go up to the head of the line and at the same time, the people at the head of the line are psychically made to mill around, so the couple can go right into the cave and stand on a small rectangular stone. This stone turns into an elevator and descends toward the lower reaches of the cave and the temple. That's all I recall.
