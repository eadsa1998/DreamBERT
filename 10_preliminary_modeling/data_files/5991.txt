I examine the coins in some change I am given and find a very unusual nickel. On the reverse is a scene of the signing of the Declaration of Independence with many people; this scene is so large and busy that it is bursting out of the sides of the coin. The front of the coin has the normal face of Thomas Jefferson, and I see the year, "1937", clearly stand out. "This old coin must be worth something", I think.
