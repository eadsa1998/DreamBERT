I'm in a crowded classroom and the rows are all in one direction, but I am seated facing the opposite way. A young man I am interested in sits in the back (see drawing) and as I pretend to be talking with my friends, I am watching him. I pick up my book, a play and look at page 171 and then back up to about 131. Some of the pages have come loose from the staples in the center (saddle stitch binding with 2 staples).
