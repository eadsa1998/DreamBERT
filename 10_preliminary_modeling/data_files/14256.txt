I was watching a video of Youtube of Darius paintballing on the street. I was looking for Eugene. The group was him and his friends and they were fighting against each other. There were lots of cameras around and the video had been edited to show it from the best angles. They were spraying fake snow at random places, on the grass etc to make it look nice. This girl with them had a scarf with pink feathers around her neck. The title of the video had the names of the people involved, including Darius's plus a bunch of Macedonian/Russian sounding names.
