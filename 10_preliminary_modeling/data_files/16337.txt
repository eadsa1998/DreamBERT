I had this, I was at my graduation party and all the guests had come in like two hours and then it was like at 4:30 and they were all kind of chowing down on the food and stuff. And I entered slowly and gracefully like I planned to, and nobody even seemed to notice; they were so busy eating and talking, they didn't even see me coming in. Then I don't know where, I was outside, and I realized that it was a different party that I was barging in on, and so I had two hours before mine was actually going to start. We were looking at these Hershey kisses and deciding whether to put this on the table or not, and Dad said that if we put them on the table, people are going to throw their wrappers on the floor and it's going to look sloppy, so if they want Hershey kisses, they can ask us. And then I said that, well, if people want Hersey kisses, how will they know to ask us? If they're not on the table, they won't want to bother us for them. And so we ended up putting them on the table anyway. And that's all I know.
