My brother Tony and I have a large truck, a refrigerated truck. We were going in on a business deal together. We were half way to Forty Mile Bend when we stopped at a house and met a few of our friends. It started to get late and we decided to stay the night. About 7:00 p.m. we discovered four girls were missing (little girls 2-6 who lived at the house). We found that they were in the back of the truck and the freezer was on. But for some reason we couldn't let them out till morning. We very carefully let the air out of the tires on one side of the truck (reason?). We couldn't let the girls out because it was too dark. Morning came and four of us went in to get them out. The inside of the truck was icy and frosty. The girl I took out was able still to talk and was talking to me as if nothing had happened. All four girls should have been frozen solid. As I talked to the girl I brought out, the more I noticed she was made of stainless steel and didn't have a head. The other three girls were alright.
