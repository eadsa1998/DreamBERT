I was confined in a hospital. I asked my mother when I would be discharged. She said I had been given a merit. She and my sister were also confined there. A little later my sister began to cry. My mother and I wanted to be discharged. Later I felt like running around the grounds to limber. I felt healthy and in control of my passions.
