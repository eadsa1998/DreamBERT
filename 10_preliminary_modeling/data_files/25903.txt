 I'm in a station wagon driving with my family. In another car I see my classmate from Brimson Monique Thorble, a woman from my grade school named  Liza Kroll, and two other women. They are all made up for a college dance. They are wearing bright, literally flashing clothes, lots of makeup, and glitter on their faces. I feel like a dork riding in a big station wagon. They know I see them, and they look back at me, noticing that I notice them, but not noticing me back. They are making fun of me, saying I am funny looking and gross, and acting repulsed that I notice them in the car. <br/
