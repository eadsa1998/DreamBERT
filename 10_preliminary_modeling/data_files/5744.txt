[1997-05-26] I was up in my bedroom trying to change a light bulb over a closet door, which isn't really there. While I was changing the one over the bed, which really is there, I also installed something which was squirting water straight down and I don't know what it was for, but it was supposed to be doing it. The problem was it was squirting too much water and I couldn't seem to get it to stop and it just kept going and going and I remember thinking that it might have had something to do with an airplane.
