I am going to experience a ride and it's never been done before, so no one knows if it will work. I curl up in a small capsule on a rocket. It fires off and I fly up out and over and down in an arc and land. I am safe. Someone is drowning in the ocean. I reach down and can't reach their arm. So I dive in and pull him up. I pick him up in my arms and carry him to a hospital. Another man who sort of likes me comes along on my right. I notice there is a chain safety pinned to him and to me. It has a sign on it, "Gay Lover." I am surprised and then notice it is attached to the man I am carrying and not to me. Apparently we need the sign there to fool the authorities so we can get the man to help. I put him on the counter in front of the nurse. I notice I put him down gently because the surface is hard and it bumps his head. I turn him over on his side and let the sea water run out of his mouth as proof for the nurse. He starts breathing.
