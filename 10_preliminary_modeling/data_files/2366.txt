I am an incredible swimmer. I dive off a diving board with such strength and grace, a triple somersault, and I dive clean and deep and hold my breath for long minutes and come up out of the water so powerfully, I literally can walk on the water and easily step out onto the pool's edge. I am impressed. So is a man who has some power and fame.
