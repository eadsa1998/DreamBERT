Now I'm an employee late to work and come in through rows of people (like at school). Someone says I've got a call for lesson #10. I go to the phone with my small daughter observing. I put on an electric guitar and ask them to play their lesson. The woman's voice says she'd rather not, she's already past that lesson and it's boring. I sympathize and say, "Just play me a scale and then we can double up on the lessons to go faster if you like." She'd like. She plays scales on a piano and makes one l/2 note mistake and corrects it. Now I'm called over to another section where I hold up a game card with a clock on it. It's part of a board game our company makes. I say, "Guess how much it costs to make this? 2 cents." And then I think it's better if they come up with the answer and I call on one who expounds at length and never gets to the point, and I regret giving them this chance to speak. Then we notice the clock is a simple brad poked through a cardboard and we try to see if the hands go around while the cardboard is turned in a circle, but we can't keep our eyes on it to decide.
