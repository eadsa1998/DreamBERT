I am the only passenger in a car being driven by X. (a female friend) and we follow a car with Y. and Z. (a married couple) into a large parking lot for a shopping center. As Y. and Z. pull ahead and out of sight, I ask X. to stop the car in front of the first store in the shopping center, which happens to be a Genovese Drug Store. "Can you let me off here?", I ask. "I'm going to be late for work." X. is somewhat surprised by this request and she says, "I didn't know you work here." I answer, "I don't want the others to know. This is a temporary job. I quit my other job." Then I get out of the car and run into the drugstore, barely getting to my position behind the counter before being late. There is a flashback and I am resigning from my old job, which was being a spy for Israeli Intelligence. "Spying is very exciting work", I explain to my superior, "but I can not take it anymore. I want a regular job." The spymaster is very understanding and he graciously allows me to leave the intelligence agency. "Do I know too much?", I wonder to myself, referring to information I have gathered during my career. "Probably not", I conclude.
