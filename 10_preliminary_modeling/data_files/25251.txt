 I'm shopping with my friend Sam Kingsley. We see some hooded sweatshirts for sale. They are solid blue or solid gray in color. They are pretty nice. Somehow we get a discount. Maybe it is Sam's discount. I think the sweatshirts must be expensive. We look at the tag, and see that they are only $15.49. That is cheap, I think, but I don't need a sweatshirt. I am wearing my blue hooded sweatshirt.
