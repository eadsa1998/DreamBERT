I was arrested for some reason. I befriended this cop because he didn't think I did it and we liked each other. He was going to be interrogating me in this warehouse, alone. I had a jacket on which could shock me. I was tied to a chair and he untied me and we got in his car. I was thirsty and we went to this Chicken Treat which was in the middle of a country place (there was bush around). The people there grabbed you. I ordered popcorn chicken with sweet and sour sauce. Ezra and Dad were also there. We all sat together. Mom was then there and there was a song on the radio called Peaches, which was by some guy. Mom said it was a guy and a girl and something about David Cronenberg. Dad and I didn't know what the hell she was talking about. Some time earlier, Mom and a friend wanted to do a dance.
