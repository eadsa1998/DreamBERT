I am at some sort of re-union party. Beth is there but somehow it is sort of tense between us and we dont talk very much. There is a pregnant girl there - sort of strung out - punk - with her boyfirend and another scary looking guy. It is obvious that those guys are assholes and that the boyfriend is not treating her right. It is so sad to think about that baby being born. The guy pushes her around and she looks miserable but takes it. Every once in awhile we catch each others eye and I mouth the words, "Dump him". She pretends not to notice. The boyfriend catches me doing this and yells, "Shut the fuck up bitch". He is hassling me. He and his friend start to seriously harass me and it turns into this serious chase. They want to kill me but I must kill them first. It is a battle between me and the friend. He has a gun but somehow I am able to hurt him and finish him off once and for all by hitting a nail into his forehead with a hammer and then smashing his head in. The police are now involved and they are after me since I am a murderer. I grab the guy's guns - he had three. They are all empty - he never had any bullets! I chuck two of them into a canal. I hear police sirens and panic - I need to make a getaway. There is a really cute guy walking by and I grab him and hold the gun to his ribs. I tell him to drive this limo that is parked nearby. I have him at gun point but he is not driving fast enough. There is no use threatening him - I am not going to hurt him anyway and I tell him this. "Move over"! I take over the wheel and start jetting it. We end up in the woods where we just chill out. I have a real crush on this guy and want to kiss him but somehow Jessica gets in the way. She is there and they end up making out. I'm kind of pissed. [Beth = friend from gradeschool no longer in touch with]
