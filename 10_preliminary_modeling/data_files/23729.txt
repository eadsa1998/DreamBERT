Jeff (my ex-fiance') and I are either flying, bouncing, or traveling.  We go in his room afterward.  After a bit I notice a woman sitting up high on a shelf.  (The shelves remind me of my middle sister's blue and green furniture from our childhood.)  I think she was small at first, like a doll, then a human.  I say "who's that?" to Jeff, and she's then beside us and Jeff says - "Oh that's Clara.  We've been seeing each other behind your back for 1 1/2 years.  You never found out."  He was very casual about it.  We had just had a great day together and he was now telling me it was over in this very casual way.  I was upset and sort of left stormy.  Later I found a grocery bag full of stuff in my Jeep that Jeff was returning to me - supposedly my stuff.  But it was not recognizable, and there were bunches of grapes on top.  I took that sack, marched to his house, opened the door (screen?) without knocking and flung the whole contents across the floor.  People were there, stunned.  The grapes smushed all over.  I said "I don't want anything from you."  Later he tried to give me something else and I found his brother (blond) [he does not have a brother in reality] and asked him - are you Jeff's brother?  Yes.  Give him this and tell him not to give me back stuff.  In this dream, although I knew it was Jeff, he looked like David (my first boyfriend) and I called him David too.
