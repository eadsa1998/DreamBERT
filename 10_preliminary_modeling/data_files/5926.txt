I am in a school class where they teach boating. Class is all girls and I am sitting at a desk dressed as a girl. No one seems to notice me or suspect I am not what I seem. Yet I want them to know. Most all are wearing slacks or shorts, but I have a skirt. Then each goes out in her own small sailboat to practice. Alone in my own boat and moving along, and now I realize that at this distance -- and especially with a skirt on -- no one would possibly suspect I am a boy.
