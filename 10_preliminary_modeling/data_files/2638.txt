I have many knitting projects, baby sweaters, cardigans for adults. I keep picking up one, knitting a few stitches and putting it down, picking up the next, etc. I keep dropping stitches off the end and it's very frustrating. Now I see a baby girl has dumped macaroni and cheese into the sink and I'm upset. What a waste. I lecture her and spank her. Someone chastises me and I realize I'm not very caring toward the baby. I feel remorse.
