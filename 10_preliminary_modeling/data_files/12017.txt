I was on a motorbike and someone else was driving. Then I was driving and it started raining. It was really heavy rain and I couldn't see. We crashed and both passed out. There was a steep drop near a two storey shopping centre. I landed on the top of the step, and the other person landed on the bottom one. It was then not wet, and it was all sunny and stuff. There were a few people around, but they were shady looking. This person and I jumped on a hovercraft thing, as did Ezra and Jayson and then the shady people started shooting at us. We got pretty far and then the hovercraft stopped. We ended up at a house thing with weird rooms. I had to share with some friend of Ezra's but I didn't want to.
