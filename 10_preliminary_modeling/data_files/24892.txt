I left the building and went to the kitchen area of the camp. My older sister was there and she introduced me to the other kitchen staff. She also showed me a picture of the kitchen staff. There were some ghosts in it and then my sister tried to introduce me to air. Then the kitchen made me be in a team go-cart race. My little sister was on my team. We fought over the go-cart we got. I got a go-cart away from the rest of my team. We were doing fine and I as in the lead when all of a sudden I went down a hill and the track forked. I took the right path and it went down a steep hill and entered a room, but there seemed to be no way out but a staircase. So I climbed the staircase and went along the track. I was having a great time and I was sure I won when I got to the finish line ahead of everybody else. Then the referee said that I was disqualified because I didn't have my go cart. I looked down and he was right. I had left it at the bottom of the stairs. I had thought I was still in it. Soon the rest of the go-carts came in. Setting: In the camp kitchen and on a go-cart track. Characters: My older sister and the kitchen staff, my younger sister and a whole bunch of other go-cart drivers, a referee. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, angry, embarrassed. I was angry at my sister and I thought she might be insane. I was happy because I had gotten the go-cart I wanted and I was ahead of everything else. I was embarrassed because I had thought I was still in the go-cart when I wasn't.
