Celine Dion was in our kitchen [laugh], actually what was happening was I was feeding the chickens and I heard Mom playing one of her albums, and I decided to come in. And she actually opened the door and was singing one of her French songs; she was singing "Brahms Lullaby" in French. I knew it and I sang along with her, and next thing I knew, we were at the counter and we like put our heads against each other and sang it like in full voice. And that was kind of incredible, and then there was something else going on. And then I was asking her, "Your new album, why were some of the tracks recorded in Stockholm, Sweden?" And she was like, "Well, it was put together by something in England and France." And I was like, "Oh." And I dreamt that she was supposed to appear at the radio station for a publicity thing to raise money for something. And I don't remember what, but next I knew, I was on the phone with Samantha, Sandra and Derek and we were all going to go on a boat trip and take this puppy that was not house potty trained, and was messing all over the place. [laugh] And then I woke up.
