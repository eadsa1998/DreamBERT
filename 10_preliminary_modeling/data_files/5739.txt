[1997-05-22] I was at the school for blind children, walking down the hall in the middle of the night, toward the younger kids' dorm area. For some reason I wanted to go down there and get a drink of water out of the fountain and the house mother stopped me and hollered at me and asked what I was doing there and I said that I just wanted a drink and its a better fountain down here and I thought to myself 'F your mother' and then I thought I'm glad I didn't say that out loud.
