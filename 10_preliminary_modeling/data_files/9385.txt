We are standing on a stone ramp with a view of the ocean; there is a storm and we see tremendous whale and sabre-toothed sharks leap out of the water and swim so close you could touch them. I comment on how dangerous they look and how close we are to a radar detector device located right next to an atomic plant. Fear. Many security regulations. Then there is a strike in a plant and there are streams of refugees coming in by train. We discuss the Jewish question, but I am mostly worried because I cannot call our baby sitter because we are not to use the phone for fear of leaving fingerprints. Great tension.
