["Call 911."]  I am in a house. I walk from room to room and see that all my TV sets are stolen. In their places, the thief has put smaller TV's. I ask a man, perhaps my brother Jake, where's my 32" TV set. He says he doesn't know. I am upset. A woman is there too. I then see a small baby, with blood on it's face. I realize the man  has been hitting the baby. Abuse. I am more upset and realize I can't turn my face away on this. I may be week about the TV's being stolen, but I can't ignore the baby abuse. I am looking for the phone. I find it and call 911. There is a long wait. The man and the woman are very upset with me for calling 911. I am resolute. This must be done.
