Sydney (Alias) was in some tunnel on the ice. Then she was dreaming and it was still at some icy place. Her mother had prevented getting caught at some time, while she was skating? Her family was different and she had two little brothers. They died and then were brought back to life and killed again. In 'real life' Sydney was frozen in the ice.
