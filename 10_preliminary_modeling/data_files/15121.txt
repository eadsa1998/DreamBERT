I was watching Lost. I overheard Locke being told to kill everyone, except for himself and River (Firefly), though sometimes she was Kate. Later, Jack had to go talk to some people in this cabin thing. Charlie, Kate and I were outside. They asked Jack if anyone was with him and he said yes and that it was a guy. They asked him to describe the guy and he realized he shouldn't say where everyone was and he said "big" -- he was talking about Locke. I realized what he was doing and I got Kate and Charlie to go around the other side. There was a mirror and I saw them peek out. Charlie wondered what was going on and I whispered that Locke was told to kill everyone but himself and Kate and Charlie was upset and confused because he was close with Locke. Then Charlie and I were outside a building and there was a school nearby. An Asian lady came over and was speaking in an Asian language, then English and gave us a workbook. She took us to the teachers lounge or something. There was a TV and some spoof movie was playing. The food there looked very greasy and fattening. Someone asked who Jason Bateman's "twin" was and I said 'Justine', but that I didn't think they were twins and that she was older. I looked it up and he was born in 1963 and she was born in 1964 and I said 'yep, she's older', then I realized my mistake, but I didn't correct it.
