My cat has swirls of hot pink fur, especially on her chest. She lays on me in despair, talking of suicide. We are on a playing field on the inside of a running track. Some people are playing ball and the ball keeps falling near us. We ignore them but wonder if they are annoyed with us. Then I see a group of fat, some disabled women, doing exercises all in a row. Then I see my cat riding on the back of a strange broad-backed horse around the track, running somewhat difficultly and catching up to a group of track runners.
