A man is stealing things and I hesitate and then join him. It's kind of fun. I grab a pack of Salem cigarettes and some chocolate candy and some money. After a while of being concerned he will get caught, I get "caught up" in the excitement and blatantly steal things, even when shoppers are nearby. The man cautions me and says, "You could get caught." I disregard him like I'm addicted to this and then the police come and I run and hide. I go down a steel ladder into an underground manhole-like place and then I am trapped. They have me. I give up.
