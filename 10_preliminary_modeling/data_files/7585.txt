I was sitting up in bed and my mother was sitting on the bed on my right hand side and Mary and Ann were sitting on the left hand side. And I suddenly realized that it was Tuesday, the day before Christmas. And I suddenly realized that it was Tuesday, the day before Christmas. Christmas was going to come on Wednesday and I hadn't got any of my presents. I was in a terrible tizzy and I didn't know what I was going to do. Mother said, "Well, it was too late to go downtown," and I said, "Yes, it is," and Mary said, "Well, why don't you and I go over to the neighborhood dime store and do all your shopping there?" So I said, "Well, gee, I hate to buy presents in the dime store." And Mother said, "Well, what can you do, you have no other choice."
