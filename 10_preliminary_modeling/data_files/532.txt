A female friend has invited me for dinner. She is showing me an idea for a commercial. Her kids are attempting to steal a certain blue t shirt and three of them are pretending to be the "Olson Boys." It is funny because the Olson boys are actually cops. Something about putting the shirt up a chimney to get it out of the house.
