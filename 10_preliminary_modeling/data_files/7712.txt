I was talking to two women and a man. One woman was Darren's new wife but it wasn't Angie Ho and I'm not even sure that Darren was my ex-husband. My ex-in-laws were there but it wasn't Ray H &amp; Kay H [different people than in waking life]. I had begun to feel good about how I was doing on my own when the ex-wife shows up and tells me that he hasn't kept up with the car payments and now I have to catch them up. I got very upset.
