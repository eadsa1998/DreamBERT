I went to the nurse and told her my deaf ear hurt. She put some drops in. Then I went to three different rooms. One was Miss W's, a large L-shaped one. I thought now she can entertain her brother in her room by screening off one arm of the L. Noting there was still 20 minutes to lunch time, I decided to call on R. When I knocked on her door, she was not dressed but I told her it was Madorah come to call since we no longer shared a room. So she let me in. A plump stranger in a bright colored figured gown was with her. She spoke to R. in Spanish and R. answered to my surprise as I didn't know R spoke Spanish. In the third room were three women. I sat down but soon got up and asked whose room it was. No answer.
