I was reading a book of Shakespeare's plays, but rather than seeing the words, I was visualizing the plays on the stage. The play I was seeing seemed at first to be King Lear, but soon I realized that it was another tragedy which I had heard of, but I didn't know what the name was. When I had finished reading, I knew the name. I awoke, but could not think of the name.
