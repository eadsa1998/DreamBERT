I was in a building, that I think was a school, but there weren't any classrooms. I was in a room there and Charlene was there. Calvin was there too. This music video came on and Charlene was saying how much she loved Evanescence. She also said that she remembered Calvin (she hasn't ever met him or heard about it). She said that she remembered that he had run off with 'Delilah'. She was arguing with her parents.
