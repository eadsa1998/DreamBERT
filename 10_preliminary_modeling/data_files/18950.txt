I was selling a sponge mop to a woman. Now this I imagine is an outgrowth of my Fuller Brush work, but this is definitely not a Fuller mop. I do remember at any rate pointing out the sponge and the quality of its cellulose fibers and all, and how the regular attachment worked and also a hardwood handle that screwed into the mop head. Now this is one feature we do not have on a Fuller mop. She wasn't saying much, but she acted pleased at the mop. Then the scene shifted, and this next thing I was selling I have no idea what it was, but anyways it was a, it looked like a bathing cap, but it was lined with a sponge, sponge rubber material, a white sponge rubber material. It was about a quarter of an inch thick and on the outside of it, it was just black rubber. Again, I have no idea what it was. There was one other thing. I was selling a, I guess it was more of work clothes or something for cleaning up a house or that you could wear, to a man. He was about my age, I guess. He was a little perturbed at me selling it to him because whenever I try to sell anything to him, he always bought it, and he really didn't want to buy anything.
