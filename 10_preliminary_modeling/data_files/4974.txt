I am dancing. I have a very wealthy guardian and this is like a debutante ball. I'm wearing a blue velvet evening gown. The gown and I are very beautiful. I dance first with one good-looking man, then with the next and then with the next. There are 3 that are the best that I am interested in. One is blond. Then two men escort me to a sort of "throne" chair. They simultaneously pour liquids into my champagne glass, the mixture needed to be swirled to make champagne. Outside there is a battle of airplanes and ships. Then the news is that my "father" must be captured or killed to prevent more war. [BL]
