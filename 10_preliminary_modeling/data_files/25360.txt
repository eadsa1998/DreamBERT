 I'm camping with my friends Kevin Simpson, Melanie McDyss, and three little girls. We have three tents. Kevin and I are in one, which is my brother Wally's tent. Melanie and one of the small girls are in another small tent. The other two girls are in a third small tent. I say to Melanie that the tents can be moved so the sun will dry them out better in the morning.
