I remember very vaguely. I was sitting at a round dining room table, probably the one at home, discussing with Armand. During the discussion I thought of going to Europe again for a month so that he would miss me the way he did the last time I went. Facts: Armand has been my boyfriend for the past three years. He is 23 years old.
