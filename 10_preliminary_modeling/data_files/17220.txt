On a field trip driving along the beach.  We were to view something, but first had to find it.  My 6th grade teacher Mr. Man was there. My group decided to turn off to the left to check a dune cave.  We failed to find it.  Then we were to return and see what it was that my longtime friend Kip's group had found.  We turned off to the right this time, where it was said they'd found it.  I was the one to have to check the cave.  I saw various body parts.  I think we were to see Jesus' thumb.  We found everything else but were missing that.  It was horrible to cram into that tiny little space with body parts of a dead man.  He was wearing green.  Finally gave up and went through, and was in a sort of arcade.  I had a yellow ping pong ball that I was to follow from one game station to the next, as, by fluke, I seemed to be doing well at them.  At one I had access to grab the ball.  I was to place it on a little hole, hit the button, and shoot it across into a trash can.  After two shots, the power went off.  We went back to the elementary school where everyone was in the cafeteria for awards.  I was on stage standing with some others.  They were giving away candies with notes attached for those with the most interesting things to say about the rocks they'd found.  My best friend Emma, with curly hair, was of course one of the first to get something.  People started to leave.  I sulked the full time; how could they even think of doing something like that when it wasn't a fair contest?  You had to have written something.  Ore even known to look for rocks before you could really enter.  I hadn't known, of course. Yet they entered me in the contest and gave me a consolation candy.  It felt very degrading.
