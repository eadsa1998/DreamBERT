I am looking at glassware at a garage sale, a pretty glass platter and some hand blown glassware. It seems a bit spendy and though I like them, I choose not to buy them. I move on to the next table area, leaving room for other women to get the glassware. The next area is a huge sewing machine with a drawer that swings open to reveal thousands of brightly colored threads and bobbins. I close the drawer to get a better look at the miniatures underneath it, on the floor. I see a cunningly made sewing machine with recipe books that open, buttons that work and levers that work. I am impressed with the workmanship and the many things that really work. I next look at a small square box like thing made of logs that opens up on top and is a stove. I see a pile of small squarish pieces of wood that have lots of resin on it so it will burn well. Someone puts one in the stove and lights it. I am amazed that the wood stove doesn't burn down with the wood fuel! How does it do that?
