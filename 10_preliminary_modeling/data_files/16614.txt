The night before I had a dream that, of all things, I was at the _______ School of Music, but, you see, it was kind of like Westport College in that there were like a wide variety of stuff __________, but the music program was like their crown jewel, if you will. And we were up there and Josie was going there too, and it was graduation time. And I was graduating with my Associate's in just general stuff, like I did at SPC, and Josie was graduating with her Bachelor in Education. And just then I was starting to realize where I was. Josie and I were in this lobby, we were walking around. It was kind of dark and I don't know what we were doing, but we were doing something to kind of prepare for graduation. It wasn't the actual like put on your gown, it wasn't the actual ceremony. It was like some administrative stuff that we were supposed to do when we were to exit the program, if you will, or something. So were in this lobby walking around, and we were sitting down on these benches, and I was realizing that I'm here at this best place in the world really, and I didn't take a single music class. I was just filling up my plate with general stuff. And I felt really, really bad, and I felt bad that I had missed the chance to major in music, and I think that was _______________. And I was thinking what to do, try to get my ____________ going to do for __________. Hopefully I could make that go a little better and at least take a couple of music classes and stuff, even if I couldn't major in it. And then Josie and I were walking around the patio outside and I was still thinking about ________. There was no real dialogue in this dream. It as mostly only one or two things and a whole bunch of thoughts going through my head. But then the next little scene was where I was in ___________ _______________ and I was practicing, I was playing "Amazing Grace" and I was thinking how, I was really having a lot of feelings like I didn't have enough time to practice, and how was I going to pull this off? How were we going to pull off this being a good musician thing when I don't have time to practice and I don't feel like I'm getting my stuff down right? And then something happened. I realized that my keyboard was really this odd thing that was built into an office desk. If you can imagine one of those desk blotter calendar things with keys on it, meaning that the white keys were really, really ______ and had like calendar stuff ______ on them, and the black keys were like really, really short. Imagine having to play something like that. And I realized, "Well, gee, this is something that I was given because I don't really play well enough to have a real keyboard." And then, as a little more time went along, I realized that it didn't really have keys at all, that I was just imagining it, kind of like I used to do before I even had keyboards, I used to have this kind of thing. And then I woke up, and I was, you know, this dream, when I woke up and I went to my real keyboard and the lift of the keys was normal, and it was the perfect way that your hands fall in a curved position and touch the white and the black keys, I felt so grateful and kind of like I did when I first got it. I'm just rambling on; I can't find the right words here, but it left a whole other feeling in me that it's really a blessing to be able to play, even though I might get frustrated at myself sometimes, and even though I might have issues sometimes. It really is a new day in my life because I'm a musician.
