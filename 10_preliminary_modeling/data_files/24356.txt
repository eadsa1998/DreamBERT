Vampire. Stuck inside with faulty Internet or computer network. Dragons. Assembling the savior device -- the little robot that downloaded into the big computer system and secretly grabbed parts as it went. Like an r2d2. Waiting for the event. The bad guys had already captured our dragons. They were waiting to die. I was one of our assets, which I thought was sad, since I wasn't battle tested.
