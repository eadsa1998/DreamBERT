I was going to school to take my two exams, and first of all Mom was late getting out of the house and I was late to my Spanish exam. And then I dilly-dallied around and I was real late, and I don't remember anything about how that went. But then I was stopped by Mr. Kunz after my Spanish exam was over, and had to sit down in his class. And he gave the exam which I had never been in his class one day this year. And in his class his exam was very weird. It was like philosophical, and he had these things where, these questions where you, in order of the alphabet you sing the scale and it corresponds to certain letters and you're supposed to sing the pattern, sing the letters, and then recognize the pattern and then sing some other letters and see which ones make the pattern. That was weird. And the whole time I was taking that exam I was missing Ms. Hanson's exam, so that's my exam dream.
