I dreamed that one day I came back from school and I was on the bus. Then my friends said "Gosh, every day when our bus gets off here to drop you off, there is a car full of guys waiting for you!" I said, "No, they might just be waiting for someone." I was a little afraid but then I got off the bus and they followed me. Then I walked faster, then I opened the door and ran upstairs and walked into my house and locked the door.
