I am engaged in writing an article or essay which is to appear in 2 parts, the first part called "Epidomium" and second part "Pandomium" (these spellings may not be exactly right, but the words looked very much as they are here spelled). "Epidomium" was started. As each chapter was finished it and whatever preceded it was sent by mail to someone who either criticized it or wrote a chapter after which the whole was returned to me. The note book in which "Epidomium" was being written was about size of the one in which this dream is recorded. Postage charges seemed exorbitant.
