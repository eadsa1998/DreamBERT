Frank Cole was among the group of people attending Mass in a church. I was seated several rows behind him. There was some noise coming from outside the doors of the church. Cole stood up and complained in a loud voice about the noise, which consisted mainly of peoples' voices. The priest turned around and gave him an angry look. Later Cole and another man were doing some manual work. They resented my not working also. I said that I studied philosophy. I was told by someone to listen to a story about the Nazis.
