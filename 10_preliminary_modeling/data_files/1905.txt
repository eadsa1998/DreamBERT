A selfish, mean woman kidnaps us. We are on a boat that is going around the Columbia River to the next stop. It's a short ride, like going around and around in a bathtub. She's after this guy sexually. He's not interested. Then she chooses this other guy who is more like her, and she has a great time with him. Then she comes out and hands platters of leftover food (ham, bread, etc.) to another man and leaves. The man thinks she's generous, but I know she's not. She was done with what she wanted and carelessly left the remains with someone else, so she wouldn't have to clean up herself. I was a little jealous because I wanted the food and "had more right to it." I'd been around and this guy hadn't.
