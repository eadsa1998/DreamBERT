["His Royal Miniscule."] I am a member of this family. Father is like Paul D., kind of dumb and benign. Someone announces there are three kings now. 3 generations of kings have been born. The youngest one, is His Royal Miniscule, a cute baby that looks like a stuffed baby Santa Claus. Red fur and white beard. He is so cute, I pick him up and hold him in my lap. I tickle his tummy and we giggle. We play.
