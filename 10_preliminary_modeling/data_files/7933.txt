We were getting ready to take Matthew to the hospital for his surgery. Bill F was going to go with me. I guess it was Bill F, Matthew, and me. Doctor Pa and Doctor Pi were both there too. They had some kind of stockings over their faces, making their faces look very strange, like a bank robber might do. They had them over their faces for the surgery, which they were discussing. Doctor Pa planned for the surgery and some options. I wanted to be sure what they were talking about. I said I would like to get it all done today and someone said, ok. Well, then that's what we'll do. I still didn't know what that meant. The five of us were going to drive to the hospital together. At first I asked if I was to ride in the ambulance with Matthew or drive separately. I think they said we could all just drive. I asked Doctor Pa if he wanted to drive and the rest of us just ride along since he knew the best way. He said that was fine.
