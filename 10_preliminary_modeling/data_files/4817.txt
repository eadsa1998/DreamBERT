I am in an apartment. There is a baby girl sleeping in another room. I am standing in a dining room with Charla. I look out the window and see a huge black tornado funnel. It looks like it could come our way. I tell Charla. I then see there is another one on the left. I say it might hit us here. Charla and I watch as it approaches. Get under the table I say as it is obvious it will hit us. I worry about the baby girl but think she's safe so far away from the window. The tornado hits and I hear breaking glass. Fortunately the dining table protects us from getting hit by flying glass. After it is over, we get up and walk outside. I am picking small shards of glass out of my hand and arm on my left side. I'd picked them up as I moved through the broken glass on the floor to get up. They hurt but it is not serious damage.
