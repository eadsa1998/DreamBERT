 I'm with my friends Persia Miko and Nicole Peterson. We are in my room. Physically, they look very much like they do in real life. But their personalities and actions are different. I am lying on my bed. Nicole comes over and sits on the bed. I move over to give her room. She is almost sitting on top of me. She gives me a t-shirt. It's for my sister, because tomorrow is her birthday. Nicole is very forward, while Persia is shyer. Persia comes over to the side of the bed and sits down behind Nicole. Nicole gets on top of me and leans over. Her thick hair falls in my face and we brush cheeks. I kiss the side of her face and her ear. Persia is next to Nicole. I lift my hand up and caress her cheek and lips. She kisses my hand, and licks it.
