I am doing some friends a favor of taking them to the Airport to catch a plane; I remember swimming to "Y" where they are staying. We are at a RESTAURANT and there is endless CONFUSION about when and where to meet our friends again, and also a long sequence of WAITING, since there is no waiter to take our check; While we wait we decide to go to buy two loaves of bread and some apples for our journey; we are hungry and slice off a piece from the loaf of bread; we decide just to leave the money on the table with a note for the waiter who never appears. Finally, we receive our mail and have to go up a complicated stairway and CORRIDORS to the upper level of the hotel (?) and we finally meet up with our friends again.
