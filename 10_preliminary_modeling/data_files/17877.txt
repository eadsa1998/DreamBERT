I was a woman like Ellen Rimbauer and it was long ago- how long ago, I don't know, though.  1900s, 1700s maybe, watching from the third person at first.  I had a girlfriend, I think, so it threw me for a moment when I found out I was pregnant.  Then I remembered I had a boyfriend as well.  I remember thinking it was somewhat odd given the time that I was not harassed about being an unwed future-mother.  I talked to someone- perhaps a doctor, and found out my "mother" was the first person to ever have an abortion, and then I understood.  At some point I gave birth.  I think there was a lot of blood, but I was very weak afterward.  The dream became 1st-person perspective at this point.  I was the mother, still weak, but things were modern-day at my parents' house.  My mother was my "mother" now, and my maternal Grandma Jane and my father were there.  I was still recovering when my brother Stuart and his wife Sheila made a surprise appearance.  They didn't know anything of what had gone on.  I slowly and carefully walked, leading Sheila upstairs into the guest bedroom (Grandma Jane's house).  It led out to a huge balcony overlooking the backyard (parents' house).  She decided to jump down.  I gingerly walked back down the stairs and met her in the rumpus room.
