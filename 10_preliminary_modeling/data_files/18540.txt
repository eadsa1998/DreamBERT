There was a girl monkey. She was scrawny and tired and she had one lone, limp ribbon tied in a knot around her head. It was red and looked tired. The knot was tied just over her left eye and the long end hung down right in front of her eye. I had to lean close to hear what she was saying. I leaned so close (that) I could feel her breath, hot, and smell the cigarettes she'd been smoking. It was the first monkey I'd ever known who smoked. Her upper arm (was) balanced on top of her head and her forearm (was) hanging down slightly to the side of her face. The cigarette was an extension of herself and she was tired. Her breath was stinky and hot. Chuck was gonna read one of his poems at a bar that was open on Wednesdays.
