It is Halloween and I have lots of costumes and clothes on a rack. A man is looking at them and I go over and flirtatiously go through the clothes as I make my way toward him. He then doesn't seem too interested. A small girl and her mother see a lovely white brocade or satin two-piece suit of mine and hold it up to the girl to see if she wants to wear it for her costume. I feel a bit upset as it's my actual clothes and pretty, and then I see that when it is on the little girl, it is a costume. I then go to a coffee table and pick up some cards to show a small boy. They are Valentine cards and cute. Then as I arrange them, I sing "Oh Holy night" My voice is beautiful and I get confused with the melody of "Oh, Silent Night." I say, "Look at the beautiful stars." I look out the window like it's the M City front window and see a mass of stars with patterns. I realize I'm looking at an ornate design my mother made and put up as decoration. I try to look beyond it and see a dark, natural sky with just a few stars.
