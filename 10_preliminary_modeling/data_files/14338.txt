I was out the back of Mom's old house. There were round fat fish in the fish pond, which had legs and a face that was duck-like. I was talking to one of them and this guy was there, I think. Someone complained about waiting for Ezra and Dad. We were getting the money for MUPC together. Mom asked me something. I was later on my computer and my desktop was of Supernatural.
