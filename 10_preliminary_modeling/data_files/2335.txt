Ellie and I are going to church. We sit down and then I see my Grandma Mildred,  I get up to go sit with her, hoping Ellie will understand and won't be hurt. Grandma goes upstairs to the balcony where the women's guild is selling food. I help them. We look over the balcony rail to see the preacher giving his sermon. After church, there's a Bible study group and we are there. I feel sleepy and lean back to nap. Grandma does too and then she gets up on the back of the curved couch to lay down, like a cat would, her feet hit the face of a man in the group, she scoots over to my side. I smile to see her like that. Then I say, "It's after 2:00, can we leave pretty soon?" She agrees and I start packing up my supplies, disks, pencils, papers, to take with me. I leave six pencils that might have been the church's property, hoping I don't take their stuff with mine. We drive off. [BL]
