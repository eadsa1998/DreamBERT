I was at work and these two old ladies came in. They worked at my work, even though in real life they don't work with me. For some reason the old lady was mad at me and she grabbed my bead necklace. I got very mad and said, "Don't touch my necklace." Then I pushed her down and said, "How would you like me to flush your wedding ring down the toilet?" Then this guy I work with slapped her.
