In last night's dream I recalled the dream of Disneyland.  I was with a group of people, Gloria from core class and my high school friend Leon included.  We underwent some training and tests.  One test was in a store.  Go stand on the mark, and follow the man's lead.  He took me to a frozen food aisle, and said he was going to carve my name into the glass door.  My task was to rub out the scratches with sugar water.  After that, I was in a daycare center, sort of a library with stacked boxes and boxes of old books that I had to organize.
