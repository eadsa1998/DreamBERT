I'm at grandma Mildred's house, packing to go somewhere, maybe school. Bonnie is around. Then my "son" wants to build a harp. I tell him, "That's too hard," but he insists and does build an ornate, complex instrument that sort of folds up. I then find a picture, a photo, where you can see the jigsaw patterns. One part still has the puzzle pieces on it. We remove the parts. Something is wrong with the lady's eye. I called it a name and ask what was wrong. No one knew. The boy is impressed. He says he's amazed at how talented I am. I am equally amazed because he's more talented than me! Doctor A, doctor drama, acting.
