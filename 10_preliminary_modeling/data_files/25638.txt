 I'm on a street corner. My roommate Stephen Ramos and friend Nat Miller are there. I am losing my sight. There is a cold front that moves in from Corn Town to Woodland, Nat says. This means that my sight is leaving. I think about restorative operations. I also think of trying to see even though I'm going blind: just ignoring the illness. A cute woman walks by. She reminds me of my co-worker Megan's friend named Courtney. A man is standing with us. He looks at us, indicating his interest in the woman. We all think she is attractive. Stephen throws a snowball at her. It hits her in the lower back portion of her neck. I have a helmet on. It is black with holes cut out for my eyes, mouth, and ears. The cute woman throws a snowball that smashes me in the ear hole of my helmet. The police come to see what is going on. I try to explain we were just joking around with the snowballs. The police take Stephen away. The woman and I get along well.
