My roommate went to Michigan last weekend to visit a mutual friend to whom I spoke the week before. At that time he asked me to get him a date for that week, and he didn't come. I then dreamed that my roommate came back with the friend, and I proceeded to shout at the friend for not coming in the week before, and thus making me feel funny for having tried to get him a date.
