I went Christmas shopping. The weather was pretty bad. It was snowing with low visibility. I thought it was a good day to go shopping because not too many people would be out. I was also getting my car worked on. I went to Glenview Mall. I was looking for a ramp that you drive down to get to a certain parking area or certain stores - I'm not sure which. It's not like this in waking life. While I was out I ran into somebody I knew. It seems that maybe it was Margaret L but it didn't look like her. It was a rather thin woman with black hair. I knew her in the dream and it seems that I knew her in waking life but I'm not sure. I talked to her outside, sitting in separate cars. I guess we pulled up next to each other from opposite directions so both driver sides of the cars were next to each other. I think I realized that there was more than one ramp to use for what I was looking for. It seemed that more than once that I was driving looking for that ramp. I also at one point saw Jody S and Jason S S, I know Jason S S for sure. He was one of the people I was shopping for. I asked him about his shirt size. He said 18 neck. He said 18 and a half sleeve too but he said I didn't have to worry about that because that's hard to find. I told him if he gets more than one flannel shirt or more than one (maybe colored Tees) that it wouldn't be a big deal because he can always use more than one. Then I said, Right? He smiled and said yes.
