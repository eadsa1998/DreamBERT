["Church In Basement, Machine Guns"]  I am in a friend's house. She is very ill. Someone is after her. I am trying to help her. I walk carefully out the front door with a gun. I threaten the people to back off. They are trying to find a special treasure. I see a mud puddle by a door to another part of the house. I feel in the water for the treasure. The water slowly drains away. I see some ceramic figures in the muddy bottom, but not the special treasure. I now see a door to a church in the basement of the house. I am looking down a long distance. A woman from the church looks up at me and I signal her. She nods and goes to another room and returns with the golden treasure. An urn. I nod again and she takes it back to the safe it was kept in. I jump down into the church. The people are after me and I run through the halls. I see church women, friends of my friend, who are happy to see me here again. I peek into a couple of rooms to see other women doing classes and so on. I get to the room next to the safe. A group of people are seated in a circle. I run in. The bad people are shooting and the seated people scatter, running for safety. The room is now an open field next to the large building. One machine gun is up on a high wall and shooting. I see one woman walking into the dangerous area. I notice it is Monica Lewinsky. I wonder if we'll see Bill Clinton next. The machine gun chatter keeps getting stronger and faster. I look again from my hiding place and see a long series of garbage cans stretched out with perhaps 5 or 6 machine guns in a circle at the end. A gatlin gun. It is spewing bullets all over and is now moving toward me.
