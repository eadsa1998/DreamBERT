Some kids got to school to start filming for a movie, myself included. Only a few people did. Later, we found out that there was going to be an assembly. Ms Solomon said "... couldn't do this next year!". I was next to Daryl and his hand was on my leg and I didn't feel weird. We got called to the assembly and the class got attacked. We ran into this assembly place which had two entrances at the top and then these steps went all the way across and continued down (like a cinema, without chairs). Then it was somewhere else and there was this alien guy called Arthur. He went yellow and his face was big. This lady nurse/receptionist got scared by him. The doctor came and was trying to help it. There was a photo of what Arthur looked like normally and we were descendents of him.
