I'm in a large cinder block building, similar to an airplane hangar or warehouse. I'm waiting to see Joe, a feisty old man who worked at a sweet shop when I was young. In the dream, he runs a general merchandise store. Other customers wait for him too. I'm with someone else, a friend. We begin to argue over something he's said. It's a misunderstanding I could have let pass. I go to another part of the store. I see a man who looks like Joe, but it's his son. Another young man approaches me. It seems like I know him from life. He has an ornately trimmed beard. He wants to show me his artwork. We walk to an open area. He's very friendly, very sincere. He points to canvas workbags he has painted red. There is little skill involved. I tell him it's really good. I'm aware this is the right thing to do. Then I go back in the store. I see Joe. He is much younger than I expected. He wears his hair in a Mohawk. He doesn't recognize me. Then I say goodbye to my friend, or to the younger man I met. I'm shaking his hand. I'm talking to him. When I wake up, I'm saying, "It was nice meeting you."
