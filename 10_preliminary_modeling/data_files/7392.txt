I was looking over a pile of sweaters, scarves, etc. I asked mother if she'd like one. She asked how much it would be. I told her it was a gift. The pile of wraps looked much bigger now. Then we talked about new courses in science. She said one was called encounter with science. I asked when it began and she began calculating by the ages of her children.
