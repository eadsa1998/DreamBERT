I followed a girl onto an off road racetrack.  She ended up winning.  There was a group of us that had to go clean things up after the race, doing things like taking down the lights.  We decided to do it assembly style.  Someone asked where the dragon was.  He was supposed to maul you and make the race harder.  There was one word that would guarantee its coming.  My brother Stuart looked at a tape to try and remember.  I remembered.  "Demon."  I got a whirlwind of images of various roller coasters based on it.  Some red, some black, one white with lighted spike sides.  There was a knock at the door.  As I approached, I was going to look through the peephole.  I saw black space, and stars.  I felt dizzy and was pushed back from the door.  The door rushed open.  A girl with straight blonde hair came in.  She took some food.  Apparently that was in the contract that we provide food, and she's only available until midnight.
