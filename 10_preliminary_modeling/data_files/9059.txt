I was in a restaurant attending a special dating event. Everyone there was on a blind date. All of the men were bald, to varying degrees. At one point in the evening they all stopped what they were doing, pulled out hairpieces and put them on. After a few minutes they took them back off and put them away again. I asked the man I was with what that was all about. I don't remember what he said but I remember thinking that it was similar to the fact that Catholic women always used to wear something on their head when entering the church. I was also thinking about the fact that so many men are uncomfortable with baldness because they feel less attractive, but I see nothing unattractive about it all.
