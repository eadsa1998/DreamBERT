A deaf female teacher/star is being sued by her husband over the lyrics of her song. The school board makes a ruling. She and the husband drive to the school to get the decision. A hired man (agent or something) is driving the car. There is a circle cul-de-sac and on the curb is the board, who are playing a tape of the song. This somehow is an embarrassment to the woman singer and she's pissed. So as they drive around the circle, she says to the driver, "Do it," meaning speed up the car, drive it up over the curb and over the lawn and through a sculpture; destructive. The driver pleads with her not to order him to do this. He says, "Please. I'm asking. I'm begging you. I'm demanding. I'm refusing." She stiffly and angrily orders him to do it. Against his own wishes, he then starts to obey her. Some woman (perhaps me) in the back seat reaches over and grabs the wheel and they fight as the woman tries to force them to not hit the sculpture. They crash and someone, the driver or the woman, is now walking alongside the singer, screaming at her angrily! "Damn it! You could be the most kind, helpful, loving person in the world with all the gifts you have and you choose to be destructive and mean. Why? Why do you do this?" She won't listen. She's too haughty and angry.
