My brother Stuart and my mother were there, and they let me drive.  We were going to drop off Len, the French student in my French class, except I wasn't driving- we were on a tricycle.  I pulled into the court, let him off, and circled around.  I stopped and said something to him in French.  Then we left, and stopped at a pumpkin patch.
