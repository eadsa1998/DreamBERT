I was going up a high slippery slope on a motorcycle. The boy I go with was driving the motorcycle and I was on the back. There was a great deal of snow on the ground. When we arrived at the top of the slope, we got off and sat down under a tree. I was watching him and suddenly his face seemed to change and he looked at me as if he didn't care for me anymore. I was very disturbed and asked him what was wrong. He didn't answer, but got up and started to walk away. I was very upset and felt that I had lost him.
