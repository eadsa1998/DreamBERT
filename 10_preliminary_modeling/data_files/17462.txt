I was going to one of my study group member's place.  A girl from my philosophy class drove me; she lived there too.  One wall was green with yellow flowers.  All very colorful.  Someone got after me for leaving crumbs.  I went to go to the kitchen but couldn't find any way in.  I hit my head on a corner as I approached a blue ramp with red rails that led up 3 feet to a playroom, which was visible from the kitchen.
