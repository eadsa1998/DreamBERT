I was guessing names and I was close to being a winner of a grand prize. I had another list of names to guess and if I would guess them, I would win the grand prize. Ann and I were in the heights. I rode in the upper deck of the bus. I looked or saw up. I played ball with some kids, then I went wading in a clean pond of water. I could see fish swimming after my toes. I watched a lion sneaking up on Ann and I and we saw him. There was something of mine on the lawn and Ann went out for it. The lion kept sneaking up on her, then he made a leap on her and knocked her down. I climbed on a small tree and made a jump for the lion. He happened to move and I missed him. I ran and climbed the tree again and the lion came after me. He climbed the tree next to me. When he got up near me, I got hold of the tree he was on and spun it around with the lion on it. He got so dizzy, I knocked him off on the ground. He was laid out. I picked him up and broke his bones and the lion was dead. People came around and were astounded and happy that I killed the prowling lion. They said there was a $15,000 dollar reward for the lion, so I said, "Well, I will get it." Jean Helm was playing hide and seek. Julia Gibson was with Ann and I. She perked up her mouth, so I kissed her. There were two bulls watching me go over the fence. One was a black bull. He was anxious to come at me. I saw a birth of a baby boy. He talked, walked and did things like a 5-year-old. He put the light on by the switch.
