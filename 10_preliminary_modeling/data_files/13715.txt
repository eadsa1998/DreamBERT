I was in a shop I think. This girl kept calling me fat. At another time she was annoying me about not having friends and I said "Who wants them?". I grabbed this weird waffle thing and left. I was then driving and was having trouble. These cops behind me put their lights on and I was like "What do I do?!" and Mom said to just pull over and that they seemed like they were nice. The cop asked me if I'd been drinking and I said no and he made me breathe into the breathalyzer. The cop started picking on me and I was wondering what was going on but didn't say anything. I walked past Eugene's house, but it was different and in a different place. I could see through the window and Eugene was on an orange lounge that was falling apart and he was watching TV and putting this mould of an old guy on his head. Later, he was trying to get people to bet on some horse dressed as the old guy. I told Dad not to and said "it's a guy in my class". Later I was walking with some girl from school. There were these weird lights in the sky and they were falling to Earth. Soon, there were a bunch of them and we realized they were aliens. I was hiding in a car. The aliens took over Earth.
