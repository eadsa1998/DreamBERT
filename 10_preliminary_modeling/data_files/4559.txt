["Eating bread."] I am in a house. It's morning and time for breakfast. I see several very large loaves of bread. I see one is torn open on one end. I wonder if it is moldy. I open another one. Jake is saying it is a whole wheat something which means it is very nutritious. It looks white, like buttermilk bread. I look for the toaster. I see the slices are twice as big as the toaster size. I cut it in half. I look forward to eating it. It will taste very good.
