A man wants to make love to me. I refuse him. I don't like him. He rolls over and lays on top of the man in bed with me; he wants a homosexual encounter with him. That is refused, so he rolls over again to try to seduce the young girl, a teen daughter of mine, and I am furious. I defend her and push him away. He is scum and I hate him. He disgusts me.
