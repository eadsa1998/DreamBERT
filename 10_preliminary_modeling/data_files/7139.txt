The nurse said that I was to leave the hospital immediately now that the minor surgery was over and she had called a taxi for me. I saw a car drive up past the door and went out with suitcase but the car was a dray with a blue-lined wagon bed. I said twice that I wanted a taxi. The driver said there was one and pointed it out under the front of the wagon bed. I gave him the address of the K. D. Home and we started off but he took a very round-about way. Upon arrival I asked for my bill. $1.25 but my money was all in my room so I went in for it after protesting it was too high as he need not have taken so long a way. His helper suddenly appearing had helped me off with my suitcase. When I got in Mother asked me what I had been doing for these postals had come. I settled with the driver for $1.00 after hunting through my billfold and then asked for the postals.
