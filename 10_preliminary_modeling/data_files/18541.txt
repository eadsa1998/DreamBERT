I was waiting for Rudy; I decided to take a shower and wash my hair while I was waiting, because it felt greasy. I didn't think I had enough time to take my clothes off too, so I took the shower with my shorts and t-shirt on. I took off my watch though, and took the barrettes out of my hair. Half way through I decided to go finish my shower in the bathroom which was Rudy's. There were about 12 inches of old bath water that was cold by now. I stood in the water. I pulled out the plug so that the water would not be standing when he returned. I forgot I (that) I had left my shower running full force; when I opened the door it was hard to push because of water pressure. When I got it pushed open water rushed through the door, everywhere. I decided not to finish my bath because the A train was waiting (14 St. to home) for transporting residents, from all over the school district to 14 St. The second leg of the journey was far more complicated and it was not quite time to leave yet.
