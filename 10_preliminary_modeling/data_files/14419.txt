I can't remember properly, but there were zombies. It had only just happened. I was with Mom and told her we had to find somewhere secure to stay and she was like 'nah I want to do something else'. We went to this building which she suggested we go to. It was packed with people. The zombies got in and everyone started running and screaming. I ran up this ramp, which led into this room where you had to jump across beds to other beds. I did so to get to this bed near the wall (far away, less likely for the zombies to get there). Everyone was impressed at how I got there. The beds were very high up (like 3 storeys or so). I got down and some guys took it while I was gone. I left there to find a new spot. I complained to Mom to trust me because I knew about zombies. I had a baseball bat and was whacking them when they attacked. She went to take a car and I said 'no, you don't take a car at the beginning of a zombie attack, maybe in two weeks'.
