I was talking to someone about finding something in my right breast, that it might be a lump but I wasn't sure. They thought I should go see my doctor and have it checked. I wondered what Doctor Pf would say if I went to see him and told him that I had a dream that told me I had a lump in my right breast. As open-minded as he is, I think even he would find that a bit odd. I think he would honor my concern and check it anyway, but I think he would be doing it more to appease me than anything.
