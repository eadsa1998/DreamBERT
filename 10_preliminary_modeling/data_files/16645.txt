we were supposed to be together with family or something, like Samantha, Sandra and Derek, and that we were going to go to some theme park, but somehow in all of this we were riding in the car at nighttime and it's like when we used to bring Samantha and Sandra and Derek home from another state. And they were in the back and I was laying across Mom and Dad's laps in the front. And the next little scene was that somehow I was all grown up and I was supposed to, I was scheming and planning a way to buy two tickets to a theme park and save it. I had won them or something. And I thought I was going to buy two tickets to Adventure Island, but as it turned out, I realized that I wouldn't really want to go there because a lot of the water things that were there have these ____________ and all the scary things in them. So I decided in this dream some strange lady gave me like a program of concerts going on and, you know, ___________. And in this dream I decided that I was going to M______ instead because of all the concerts and everything. And I had come up with this plan thinking that Mom and I would be able to go _______________, but Daddy __________ complaining about everything anyway. And I was looking over this program and it said that Bette Midler and Barbara Streisand and other people were going to be there, and I was trying to make my plan. The hardest _______ deciding which day to go and who to see. And then I woke up.
