["Princess Meets Mud Man"]  I am a young Arab kind of princess. I am outside playing. My old grandfather, the King is watching. He is proud of my beauty and my energy. I have been a child and am now becoming a woman. I have long dark black hair. I turn cartwheels and run happily through the grass. Grandfather goes in to palace. I am walking back to the front door when I see in the ground a small hole. In the hole is a man's face in a pool of water. He has beautiful brown eyes. His image recedes under water as I approach. I go into the palace and ask for my Grandfather. No one responds to me. They bustle around very busy. I go toward his bedroom. I enter a room and then turn  left and enter yet another room. He is there, very ill, in a white hospital bed. It is very high up and big. There is white netting all around the bed. I walk around the bed trying to find a way to get close to him. I finally command a servant to lower the bed. He does so. I hold my dying Grandfather's hand and I tell him of the mud man. We guess it is a spy from the other kingdom which wants to take over our kingdom. My grandfather decides that when he dies, he will make me queen, skipping the men of his command. He smiles at me and then dies. The men are not happy about this sudden change.
