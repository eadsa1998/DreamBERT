Because of a fluke, the royal succession was changed to the King George and Clara line, sometime back in history. A brother or cousin of the king likes me and makes me a member of a court group. I join them for lunch. They don't like me and snub me. They give me and my daughter chairs that are too short for the table. We laugh and try to be charming about it. They put something called "wigglies" on my plate, live creatures in a hollandaise sauce. Yuck!
