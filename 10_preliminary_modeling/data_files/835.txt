I have died and gone to heaven. I'm confused. I'm not too sure where I am or what to do. It's a check-in counter. A tired woman (overworked) asked me if I used too many credits (like overdue books). I say, "No. If anything, I've used too few," (I feel a little guilty, like I'm lying, maybe). She has a file folder to check later. Cory is standing next to me. He has died around the same time I have. She gives us our instructions. We will now go live in the clouds. If it is too crowded, which it is getting to be by now, we will move on out into space. I feel some hesitancy about doing so. I don't want to yet. She says, "It's permissible to return to Earth and visit people. It is forbidden to make yourself known to the living. However, some of them are very sensitive and will feel our presence." I go back to Earth and sort of curl around some people. I want to hang around the ones that feel my presence and miss me. I find it hard to pull away from them.
