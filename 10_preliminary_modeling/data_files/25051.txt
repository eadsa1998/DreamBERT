 I'm with my friends Tom Napper, Nat Miller, and Nate Nelling. We drive to a mall-like complex. Tom, Nat, and I go in. We rollerblade through the mall, going past a concession stand, and out another door. Tom tells us about an attractive girl. We're outside in a long and narrow parking lot which seems to be the one alongside the mall in Cancun. Cars are sparsely parked in it. I look for the car I drove, which is a small brownish-silver car. I can't find it. Then I realize I drove my mom's car, which is there. I turn the radio on. Def Leopard is playing. We are tossing Frisbees around and one of the speakers in the car gets blown out. One of the Frisbees has the Happy Chef logo on it. This Frisbee is my dad's: his name, "Elliot", is also written on it.
