I was looking at calendars at a store counter. I picked a Catholic calendar. Then I saw an envelope that was sealed, and I thought it might be a better calendar. But something else was inside. I felt guilty for breaking the seal, and I tried to reseal it. There was a wax seal on it which was round and about _ inch in diameter.
