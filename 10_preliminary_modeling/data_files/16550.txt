I was already at Modern Media College for orientation, and we were in this room that had yellow floors in a lightly lit area and blue floors in a darker area. And in the yellow floor area there were some desks and chairs and line up things like bowling alleys, and over the blue floor area there were various -- actually there was only one in this area -- a little work station area with a mixing board and a bench to sit at in front of it and a bench to sit at a few feet back. And it wasn't really a graded test, but the instructor was going to give us a test that we had to go up to the board, figure it out, connect the wires where they needed to go, make all the mix and let him listen to it and just to see kind of, get to know the equipment kind of like. And R_____ and I were going to be a team. And in my dream she was sort of semi-hefty and wearing blue. And in my dream she said that, "Always Be My Baby" was her favorite song. And I can't remember what we were going to play through the board, but I ran my hands all over the board, and I wasn't shy about it, and I remember bringing the masters down before I went to feel the connections in back. And there was this digital bit of cable laying next to it that I had the notion was supposed to be used for a mike input, and it was supposed to work like an XLR, but it wasn't. We had to jam it into one of the places where an XLR went. That was crazy. And so I connected it to the board and to the mike, and it was making this really awful sound. And I realized that the instructor had tied a knot in it just so we would have to discover it and untie the knot. And then it was better. And then after that, I was on the porch swing telling Mom about it, and in my dream I was feeling really confident and ready for anything basically.
