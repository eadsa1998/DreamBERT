I was at the [childhood school for the blind] that I attended from k to 9. The weird thing was, my sister Sally was with me. She's older than I am, about 6 years older. In the dream she was the same age that she is now, but I was about 14 or so. And I was very upset because I couldn't find my way to all of my classes and I wanted her to show me around the campus. And she said she would but she kept saying "I'm gonna be late for work! I'm going to be late for work!" The school was in LeBlanc and she works in Pierre, about 60 miles away, but it was really a strange dream because when I was 14 at school, my sister was 18 and she was not working in Pierre at that point. The sense I used was primarily hearing because I was talking to her and she was talking to me and touch, I could feel myself walking with her.
