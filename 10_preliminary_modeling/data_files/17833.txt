At a meeting with a group of women.  Someone made a comment about my ring from my boyfriend Jeremy on the wrong finger, and my mother came to my defense that I wear it on the middle finger because it's too big and I don't want to lose it.  It was somehow a religious gathering.  After the meeting most of the women left and I and a few others (perhaps my mother and my maternal Grandma Jane) stayed to talk- we didn't exactly agree with the others.  In the dim light of the hall I saw one of the women coming back- I yelled for them to hide and I dove to the ground.  I think they found us and tossed us out.
