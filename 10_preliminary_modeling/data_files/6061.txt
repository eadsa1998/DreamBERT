I dreamt that I woke up and my bedroom TV was on. Lady Di was being interviewed. She had longer hair. The interviewer (I think it was the famous woman who asks a lot of personal questions) was asking Lady Di personal questions about her marriage. Next her daughter (?) came in from behind a screen door. She was very attractive with long blond full hair, lots of make-up, wearing jeans, long earrrings, blue eyes. She all of a sudden said to the reporter something like, "Listen, you can tell Skinner (meaning B.F. Skinner) that you can't observe my behavior only; you don't know what I think." Something like that anyway. She was really strong. Lady Di (her mom?) was strong too. This all took place on a closed-off front porch. i never saw the interviewere, only Lady Di and her daughter like they do on a "real" interview shown on TV.
