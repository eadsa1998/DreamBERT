I was in somebody's house, a stranger's house. it was a little cozy house. I remember now it was one of my husband's relative's house--his cousin, whose mother had just died, my husband's aunt. I was telling her how to make refrigerator cookies so she could serve these to people who came around condoling her. Her mother's husband couldn't stand to live in the house any more where they lived, so he was going to sell it. There was something about a thruway that was supposed to go right thru where the house was, but he wasn't going to sell it to the thruway people. He didn't want to sell it to them. He was going to sell it to somebody else and everybody was trying to tell him that it was going to be impossible for him to do that. Well, at any rate, I went out to the front yard and there was a big magnolia tree. I was showing my husband the flowers when I noticed crawling on the branch something in a conch shell. I thought, "What in the world could it be?" I picked it up and it was a regular land snail, but it just was in a conch shell. On the shell were little places for its antennae and little eyes to fit into so when it crawled along, it could see where it was going. It was right cute because every once in a while it would have to lift its shell up and peer out to see where it was. I showed the snail to several people and I thought it was so cute and they thought it was horrible.
