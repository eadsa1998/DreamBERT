I'm walking through BR, though it doesn't look the way it does in waking life, except that it is very busy with both pedestrians and car traffic. I'm carrying a bowl of ice cream. The bowl looks like one of my dessert bowls that I use in waking life. I would like to wait until I get home to eat it but there's no lid on it and it's very warm outside. I'm still far enough from home that I'm pretty sure it's going to be almost completely melted by the time I get home. I just don't want people to see me walking down the street eating ice cream. I decide to take a shortcut through one of the back streets where there won't be anyone or hardly anyone around and then I will just go ahead and eat it as I'm walking.
