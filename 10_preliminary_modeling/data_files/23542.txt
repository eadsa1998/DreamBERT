I was at my parents' house and leaving in my father's van with my friend Carrie with an overnight bag with clothes, etc. inside. We were going out at night to somewhere. I remember sitting by the pond down the street and we were drinking alcohol and talking. Then we drove off in the van. She was driving. The next thing I remember is we were back pulling into my parents' driveway. Everything was a blank -- it was the next day. I can't remember what happened the rest of the night. I was confused, I felt really tired and funny and I realized my bag was gone. I was stressing out about where by bag was. Carrie kept telling me to act normal and relax around my parents. Then when we were alone, I was crying because I was so confused and she wouldn't tell me anything and I couldn't remember what happened that night. Finally, she told me when I asked "Where's my bag?" over and over. She said, "Katherine, your bag got ruined; it's gone. It got all messed up last night. Katherine, you had a heart attack after your second drink; you almost died. There was throw up and blood all over your bag." I was crying and crying. Then it made sense why I felt so weird, like something had happened to me.
