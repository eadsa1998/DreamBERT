I had a date with a girl. I called for her and we went out in the street. Then I was in the living room of my home and the girl was there too. We were sitting on the sofa in the living room. I had my arm around the girl. She was resting her head on my shoulder. I was telling her I loved her. An outstanding feature of this dream was that in the dream I kept thinking I must control my sexual desire.
