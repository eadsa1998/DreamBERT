I was working for Doctor C at the SVSDC. Doctor W still worked there. I kept trying to avoid him because I didn't want him to see me there. I was wearing mauve colored scrubs with a white jacket with a colorful print. I worked for Doctor C not for SVSDC. I think I was in research. One time I went in to pick something up and the night tech.
