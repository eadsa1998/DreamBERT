I was in an office building and, as I walked down the hall, I looked into an office and saw one of my girlfriends whom I went to high school with. She had recently become engaged and was wearing 3 diamond rings. Two of them were in an old-fashioned setting with two stones side by side and the whole shape of the ring was rectangular. The engagement ring which she had just received was in a modern setting and had one large round diamond. As I looked at it, I noticed that there were little curls of something resembling wood shavings and these curls covered up the whole ring. I proceeded to remove these curls, and was surprised that the girl hadn't done so herself.
