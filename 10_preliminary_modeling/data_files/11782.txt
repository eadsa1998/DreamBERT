Ezra and Mom died but I didn't know. They were at home, but Mom was acting weird and she said she was going to feed the cats, so I followed her, but she was out the back and the door was still locked. This guy took me to the "dead place" and told me to go somewhere, but I realized they were going to kill me and so I ran back. I was staying in the dead place but I was still alive because the guy (even though he was old) liked me. I fell off a cliff and Ezra saved me.
