I am sitting on my sofa, about to engage in masturbation, when suddenly I remember that Mary will soon be getting home from work. I quickly change my plans and decide to have supper ready for her when t she gets home. I enter the kitchen to prepare a meal. But there is a man in there. He has just opened a can of salmon and broken an egg into a soup bowl. I explain to him that it is important that I be able to use the kitchen in order to make supper for Mary. He is reluctant to leave. But another man comes in and explains my situation to him. The first man graciously agrees to leave, telling me I may use the food that he had started to prepare for his own supper. For some reason, both men appear to me to be Russian. Mary arrives home. She has short hair and is wearing a gray suit. We greet each other with spontaneous hugs. I notice that she is in pain and ask her what is the matter. She tells me that she has an infection, but she's been to the doctor and will be OK. I ask Mary if she'd like supper and suggest she lie down while I prepare it. She answers that she would like supper and agrees to rest while I get it ready. All the while, I am wondering how I can use the salmon and egg as ingredients for supper. Mary looks good, although the expression on her face shows that she's in pain. She is her usual sweet, kind, loving and forbearing self -- as I have always known her to be. At the beginning of the dream, I am shocked to think that I could forget about Mary coming home from work.
