I was with Ben D. We were laying in bed. We were kissing and cuddling. He said something about me always being the aggressor. I got very upset with him and said that was not at all true. So I just lay there and refused to do anything more than allow him to hold me, which felt very nice. I learned that he was ill, that he has cancer. When he realized that we weren't going to do anything more than cuddle, he told me about a machine that he uses in bed for his health. We had it brought into the bed so he could use it. I was talking to, I think his doctor. Ben D told me that he had known about this for sometime. I asked about the prognosis and he said that he thought he had maybe 3-4 years at most. Of course, I was very saddened by this.
