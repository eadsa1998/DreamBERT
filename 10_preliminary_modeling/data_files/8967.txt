I was working on material for a class, but I don't know that it was my OB class. I was preparing one particular item for discussion. This item, the information, had four categories or sections. There was a square divided into four parts. Each of those parts had one of the four categories in them. It had something to do with assertive women. I use the word assertive though that wasn't the word used in the dream. I can't remember what it was but it was similar to assertive. There were several people who seemed to come in and out, though I didn't see them physically. I actually have no image of sitting in a room, at a desk, a computer or anything like that. I was communicating with other people occasionally about this topic. I was trying to identify the positive aspects of each of these elements. They are each typically seen in a negative light. Two words that come to mind to describe this are powerful and commitment. I can't recall if they were actually words used in the dream or if they were actually part of this topic I was working on.
