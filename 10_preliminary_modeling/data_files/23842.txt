I am at a fair booth, it is kind of a crummy fair.  The booth with the covering is empty, but to the side is a big old ship, or the front part of a ship.  I go in to see it, and start to get ideas about how to make this a business, how we could use the ship as a ride or attraction or something.  I walk back in to the booth part, and am looking around planning how to set it up and market it.  Then I look up to the top boards of the booth (they are decrepit) and wonder how much money I could make here.  I realize not very much, based on the fact that fair booth people I know about do not have very much money.
