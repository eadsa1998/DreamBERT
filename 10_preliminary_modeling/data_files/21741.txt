We drove into a driveway of a farm. Then we went bowling. I had a bundle of money and my friend was a very good counter of bills. He could count less or more bills as you watched him do it. I got a paper with the entries. It had the selections which were picked by selectors which were named by an initial like K A and etc. Then I found another paper which also had the selections by different selectors. I sat by the table and on the other side we had a bright spotlight shining on it, so I went there and sat in the light and was going to compare the selections and check the horses that were picked by most of the selectors.
