I dreamt Mr. N had a gun, and was holding all the 6th grade teachers (but Mr. P) and a bunch of students hostage in his classroom. I think Mr. M owed money to Mr. N, so he got the hostages. He was getting ready to shoot James because Mr. M was taking too long. So Cara stopped him by stalling him. She stalled him right until this part ended. Then I dreamt I woke up, and went outside to play frisbee with my grandpa! It was on Green Drive, and I accidentally threw the frisbee over the highway near Green Drive. Right then Chris ("Smokey") came by. He was dressed up in a colorfully striped Dairy Queen uniform. He had a great big map and asked me for loose change!
