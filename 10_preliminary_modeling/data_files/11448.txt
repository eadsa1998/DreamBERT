I was driving along in my car, when someone hit me. I got out of the car, but I wasn't angry. In fact, I felt glad it happened because now I could get my car repaired. A friend of mine who was riding with me began to repair the seat covers, but I told him not to bother. I explained that the insurance company would pay for everything.
