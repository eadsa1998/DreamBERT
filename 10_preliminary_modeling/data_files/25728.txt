 I wake up at about 3:00 am in my room at Fishing Haven. My roommate Sean is sleeping. It is the first night here. There is someone in the next room. I go in, and see it is a guy who works at Fishing Haven also. He is wearing red and has dark hair. He is using my laptop computer, and it is in pieces! I am furious! I grab him by the head to hurt him, imprint him, and scare him. Sean comes over and stops me from hurting the man. Sean has a big long nose, medium length bowl-cut straight hair, and thick-framed glasses. I threaten the man. I am so angry the computer is in pieces. I feel violated. Two women are there, named Esse and Anna. Esse is a pretty Asian woman. She has long dark hair and a nice smile. I tell the man if he ever comes in here again without knocking I'm going to beat the shit out of him. Sean says no, I won't do this. I call the man a jerk. Sean tries to keep the peace.
