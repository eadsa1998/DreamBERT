I was in like a Woolworth store and was going toward the back where there was a counter [illegible] friendly. My mother was there with an ice cream sundae and coffee. The guy was eating the sundae and she was telling him it was not his. I walked over and was about to punch him in the face when he pulled out a gun. He shot me in the arm and I fell down. The guy also pushed my mother down. Everybody got up. He grabbed a hostage and started walking out.
