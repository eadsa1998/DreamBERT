I dreamed that I was at work and I had a fight with a customer over the change I gave her. She said I gave her the wrong change, but I did not. She kept persisting and I got madder and madder. I called the manager and had him talk to her but she said I stole her money because I needed it to buy new shoes. This made no sense to me. How would she know if I needed new shoes or not? I told her she was crazy. Next thing I knew she was grabbing all the money from the till. I told her to stop stealing. She said she was not stealing; she was just taking what belongs to her. The money did not belong to her; she was a thief. I started to grab the money back and then I woke up right in the middle of my dream.
