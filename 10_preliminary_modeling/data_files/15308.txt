I was friends with the people from How I Met Your Mother. Something weird happened and I had to do something and I ended up in the hospital and was told to do this group task and take some medicine which stung. There was a button which I had to press until the pain stopped. I left without the group and was hanging with Marshall, Ted, Barney and Robin. We were talking and laughing. There was a zip lock bag which was a contraption in pants and made it felt like something was missing? There was a show on the projector with a ninja and some other stuff. Then I found a note detailing Ted and I having a romantic moment and we had all had romances? This upset me. We kissed later. Then I wasn't meant to be 'out'. Then there were Nazi's. There was a crowd outside. Bill Murray was an animal thing and showed us the path to get outside but people didn't want to do that. Ted, Barney, others and I went to find some place. We had to line up for something. Then we were at a university. Rover was there but he wasn't allowed to be. This Nazi guy saw him and ordered for someone to put him down. I started to cry and shouted "I'll put you down!" and ran off with him. It was Mom who said that Rover was "the dog".
