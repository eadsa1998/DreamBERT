I was house hunting. I found a really cool place that another woman and her son (about 5) were looking at. The place turned out to be a two-bedroom and rent was $1000 a month. Neither one of us could afford it by ourselves so we decided to take the place together. The living room had a wall that was an aquarium with ocean behind it. My bedroom was a huge upstairs suite with a fireplace and I had my own bathroom with a Jacuzzi tub. I walked downstairs into the kitchen. The woman was making her son a sandwich. I liked these people and I was happy to be living there.
