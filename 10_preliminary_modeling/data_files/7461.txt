I am in a rural area, and the people I see -- farmhands and villagers -- are poor. They are dressed in clothing in the style of the early 1800's. They are dirty and rolling in mud or on the ground. In one scene I see someone wrestling (or playing?) with a small donkey or mule. This person threatens me with this animal, i.e., ordering it to butt or bite me. I am searching for Mary. I know she is purposely hiding from me because she is sick and dying and doesn't want me to see her in this terrible condition. Someone tells me that the "photographer" is hiding her. He is a foreign gentleman who has befriended Mary. He feels very sorry for her and is doing whatever he can to help her. I find the "photographer" and he points to the building where I will find Mary. I enter this building, which looks like an old house or barn. The colors in this dream are various shades of brown or chestnut -- autumn colors. I enter a bedroom and find Mary lying in bed. She covers her head and face when I come in. She is crying. She doesn't want me to see what the illness has done to her. I throw myself on the bed and try to take her in my arms. I lay across her body and cry heart-brokenly. I tell her how much I love her; that she is always beautiful in my eyes. I tell her I don't want her to die. I try to urge her to resume taking chemotherapy. She cries and tells me how terrible it is and how rotten it makes her feel. She wants to die rather than suffer. She tells me she loves me and doesn't want to leave me, but there is no other way. Her suffering is too great and she'd rather die.
