I had a job as a salesman in the downtown store. I dressed neat and a small girl got my department moved because she would come and hang around me asking questions. Boys from Whites were working there. I was hunting. Ann and I were hiding under a big tree. The wind was blowing hard and we took this tree for shelter. I lay on the lawn at the shop at lunch period and I wanted to know if 2-9 would be the daily double today. I dozed off and saw 1 and someone put $20 bill on the bet.
