We were driving down the highway from Clinton to Laurens. Rudy was upset because he was in trouble. While driving, Rudy was in trouble because he took the hard top off the truck (that) we were in. And have experience throw at one interstate and not. Aunt Jenny was there and she.............she hugged me. Aunt Jenny . Aunt Jackie was there and the whole count was: onesie, twosie, threesie. That whole family had a bad attitude. I was happy to be sitting under the cardboard box, but Aunt Jackie said, "You're sitting in the wrong place." I had to cook but to ???, and I had a round aluminum pie plate to use, and I was ready to use eye #3 (center). I could not ???. Then they said this. They said, "Boil, dry?"... ??? dry.
