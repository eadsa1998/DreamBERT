I took in a roommate. She was a black woman about my age. During the day she babysat children here in our apartment for a living. She was also a very good cook. She had people over for meals. I said this would work out great because I don't like to cook. We decided that she would do all the cooking in exchange for me cleaning the bathrooms. For some reason I headed upstairs to my bedroom. She had gotten rid of all of my furniture and personal items, everything that I had hanging on the walls. She had replaced it all with all of her own things. It was all an African-American motif. She had even had some remodeling done without my knowledge. I was very upset by this. Partially because we hadn't discussed this but also because she got rid of all of my things. She simply took over all the space and left no space for Matt Or me. When I went back downstairs I realized that she had done it there as well. I was speaking with one of her relatives. This relative said it just wasn't right that she had done that and I was just going to have to break our agreement and tell her that she was going to have to move out. The relative said she wouldn't change. that it would be her way or no way with her. I told her and she was very upset but she got all of her things out right away. I don't know if I hired an attorney or what. Someone heard about what had happened and had gotten different stores to give me all new furniture, new carpet. It was Beautiful cherry wood furniture. The latest in technology. radios, TV, computer, etc. Some of her relatives stayed around and was helping me get settled. They were very nice. They felt very bad about what this woman had done to me. When they got ready to leave they all hugged me, wished me well, and apologized again for this woman's behavior.
