 I'm with my mom and my sister Ramona at home in the kitchen. My mom has a whole turkey that isn't thawed well enough to cook. It's getting to be late in the evening: about 7:00pm. It's going to take about three hours to cook the turkey. I talk about he turkey that I cooked in Salt Lake City: the temperature and the time, estimating how long it will take to cook this turkey. My mom gets out a broiler pan with an electric cord, to cook parts of a chicken as we wait. We don't want to eat the turkey too late.
