Up -- you know how in the landing of the stairwell here -- there's a little round table that the old CC TV has been kind of placed on, and I like have been using it from time to time. Well, in my dream, standing on top of the monitor was a big, huge, about 4' tall -- and almost as tall as me -- it was a Santa display figure doll thing, and it was standing on top of the CC TV monitor. And you would activate it and it would just sway. It was supposed to like dance, but when he spread his arms, it was like this big, huge mess, just swaying and swaying and kind of making a noise and flashing some lights and playing a little Christmas song. But I would get nervous about this thing falling off because it would sway so wide, and I didn't really think it was going to fall off, I just thought it might. And that's really all I can remember. I think I was going to take it to a party or something, but I don't remember anything.... Now I remember some more about this dream. It had no connection to the Santa thing, but I dreamt that we were walking from an apartment in N______ Park over to the campus, and it was sort of a nice walk. I mean, we were seeing roses and stuff. But I was living upstairs in kind of a dingy place, and it was kind of small and blah, and so we were on this walk, showing me the way to Modern Media College, and next thing I know, I'm back home at this house messing with that Santa thing again. I don't get it.
