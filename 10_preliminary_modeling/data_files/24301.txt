Was supposed to meet Sue, the co-worker from the college newspaper I was attracted to, twice; both times for hikes up a mountain in a place like Paris or Brussels, on the outskirts. This may have been shortly after I met with her for coffee as I was visiting the town where I went to college. She didn't make it the first time. The second time, I saw her pull up in her car and get out with a friend. They were dressed in tutu-like clothes; for a dance concert or costume party. They were going out. I sent her multiple texts. I followed her to see if she'd blow me off or just wasn't getting the messages. I was waiting on a quiet spot on the mountain, enjoying it, but thinking how much better it would be if she were around.
