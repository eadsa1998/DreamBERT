I was walking on a street. I was in a state of euphoria. Clairvoyant visions appeared before me. Then a little girl came and asked me to lift her. I lifted her, and she thanked me. Then I had an emission, although I had no erection. I was very dejected because I had not tried hard to control myself. The visions would not come any more. Later I saw a sweater hanging on the handlebar of a bicycle. I took it to put it on; then I changed my mind. My mother and sister were there. (I left the hospital yesterday. I am now in the county jail awaiting trial.)
