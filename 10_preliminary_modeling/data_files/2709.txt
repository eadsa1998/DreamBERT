I am a (man) general in a war and I am alone in a field, the bombs exploding all around me. To protect myself, I lay down on the snow-covered, barren field. I dig a hole in the earth that fits my body and lie in it to wait out the war. It is cold. I am alone. Then I look over to my left and see girl children playing. I tell them to leave. Can't they see there's a war going on? Then I look around and notice the war is over. I get up out of my foxhole and follow the girls into a store. I look at the candy display. They are all out of the kind I like. A sweet little girl ( 8 or 10 years old) is there. Now I'm the girl. She and this little boy are Jack and Jill. They will be lovers when they grow up, but for now it is all innocent and sweet. They kiss and talk and share adventures. The general is now a grandfather and he lusts after the little girl. He sort of watches her, and follows her. She and Jack leave. She's glad to get rid of the sinister grandfather. Now Jack and Jill sit in a small boat, on the bare rock bed of a dry river bed. The water is being released upstream. It's like a carnival ride. I look upstream and see the surging force of the water and feel afraid. We'll be bowled over and drowned, so I say, "Let's wait until the big wave is past us." But we stay and the water picks up our boat and we swirl and sway down the river bed. It's fun. My girl cousins are there, Sonja and Deirdre.
