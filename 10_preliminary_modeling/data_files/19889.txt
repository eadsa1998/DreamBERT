I was in a strange hospital built like a museum. I called a colored patient on the ward named Shepherd. Later an officer from a former ward I had been on appeared in the dream. He looked on as blood began coming out of my mouth. (This officer's name was McCruden. An incident which led to my being involved in a plot to escape happened on that ward. Mr. McCruden was in charge of the ward when the plot was uncovered. This happened in December, 1960. It left me with a sad memory.)
