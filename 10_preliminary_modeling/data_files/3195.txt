Jared invites me to sit next to him on the couch. I don't want to, but hesitate. Finally, I say, as an excuse, "The couch is too low for me to be comfortable, but I prefer to sit on the chair next to the couch. See, we'll still be sitting close together." A compromise. I go to sit on the chair and then a woman, the mother of a man in the room, says, "Did you throw up in here?" I feel sticky stuff on my pants leg on the right side and see purple gunk. I stand up. The mother follows me into the next room to assist me in cleaning up. Dora is there helping. We agree it is best to take the pants off so she can thoroughly clean them. I go into the adjoining room to sit on the bed so I can take them off.
