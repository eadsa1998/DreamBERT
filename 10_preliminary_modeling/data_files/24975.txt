 I'm walking to the Meyers dorm with my friend Niles Zelling. My friend Nat Miller, and a man named Jesse, they guy that was hunting us in the Assassin game, are getting out of their car. Niles and I have already been killed. I say to the two that if they shoot me I'm going to beat the crap out of them. Nat shoots me with his water gun, and I chase him, tackle him, and punch him repeatedly. I feel bad, because I know Nat is my friend and I don't want to hurt him.
