When two spirit beings want to inhabit the same place, when they want to come through at the same time, then they each have to have a little less of reality, because they can't both be real and both come in. So they have to wear a little coat to lessen their reality .Otherwise they cannot be both in the same place. This is what happened. I feel as if I'm getting ngankari lessons.
