Last night I dreamed I was in a building which looked luxurious on the outside and on the inside it looked as though it were still being built. I was in that apartment with a friend of mine from the university (M, 18 and in my same class) and several boys I didn't know, or if I know them, I didn't recognize them. Everything happened in the building where we were and at one point, everything started to shake and I, scared, told my friend that we should stand on a concrete column which was strangely placed on the floor across the room. Suddenly the column on which I had suggested we stand was unavoidably broken and we fell with it. At that moment I woke up.
