 I'm in a computer-like lab. There are a number of people there to take some kind of test. My friend Tiny Combs was there, but left because he finished the test. I look for a Macintosh computer. There is one screen that is high up. I don't use that computer because I don't want people to see what I write. I'm with a woman there. There is an old truck. We walk by it. I note that it is like my truck. I put the truck back in reverse to park it, and leave.
