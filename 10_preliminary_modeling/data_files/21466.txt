I was driving my car. I stopped in the dark and someone put his hands thru the wing and got hold of my hands and held them. Then I was finally released. I told Ann, she got a gun and was going to carry it for protection. I said I was going to do the same. We were in the colored neighborhood and they hated us. We were sitting on the couch and then we lay down because someone was trying to get us. I had some kind of power. I pointed my finger and a liquid of fire came out and went against the glass about 50 ft. away. I was pointing at a man outside who was after us. Then we walked along the street. I had a pistol and warned the people I would shoot anyone who would try to stop my wife or me. I looked around and my wife was down. A grey-headed woman was on top of her. I ran over and made her get off. I called her names. I met a friend of mine who was going with me to save one of our friends, which were me and my wife, who were being attacked in our home. I flew up and was like Superman. There were the shady characters who were after me to stop me. I just pointed my finger and the power of suggestion stopped them. We were driving and the windshield and street froze up. It had a thin coat of ice. We couldn't make the hill. I walked up on the ice and went to the top. I was taking some kind of test or examination. It was something about Ann. I can't recall it now. There was a long roll of paper and there were some signs and printing on it.
