I am cleaning up. There is a bookcase and I tidy up the piles of books and pamphlets, "Alien," children's books, etc. There are lots of empty 3-ring notebooks or binders. I am keeping them; I might need them later. I find a pile of embossed pictures. I think one is of me, but it's not; it's of my cousin, Sonja. I see Abner and give him his picture. We talk.
