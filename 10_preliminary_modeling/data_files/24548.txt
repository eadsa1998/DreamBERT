I was on a farm with some other people. Me and my friend Tom and another boy named Fred were cleaning potatoes and picking blackberries and making blackberry jam by mashing the berries with a stick. Another group of boys were playing football and my friend Anna's group was picking carrots. Setting: On a farm. Characters: Tom, my friend from school, was wearing jeans and a t-shirt. My friend Anna was wearing a blue gingham dress with gingham ribbons in her hair (in pigtails). Fred, a boy at my school (he is not my friend) was wearing green pants and a blue shirt. There were a lot of other people from my school there too. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy.
