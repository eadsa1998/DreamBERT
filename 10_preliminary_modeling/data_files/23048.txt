My wife Bonita and I were taking a trip by car.  We were in the Midwest or far west, and were parked on a small dirt lane or path in the middle of a bare field.  There was a large group of rather poor-looking people.  We heard on the car radio that the "squatters" had been evicted by court order-so we expected them to move on.  Instead, however, a couple came up to our car looking very menacing.  I made sure the windows were up and the doors locked.  The guy on my side took a branch of a tree and started pounding the top of the car with it.  It looked like a very bad situation, so I started the car immediately and drove away.  Just before we left the field and entered the adjacent street, we passed some enormous sunflowers in the field, 10 or 12 feet high and thick as a grove of trees.  I wanted to get out and look at them, but we were still too near the squatters for me to feel safe.  Across the street from the field, though, in front of some old houses, were some more.  I got out to take a picture, but when I did it suddenly became very dark and cloudy.  One of the flowers crept around to the opposite side of a telephone pole from us and faced away from us.
