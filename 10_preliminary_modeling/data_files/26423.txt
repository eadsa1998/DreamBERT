 I'm looking at the front page of a very popular newspaper with a large circulation. The day of the paper is a big day, like New Year's Day or something. There are several large photographs on the front page. One of them, the largest, is a photograph of a crowd. There are many of the Redding extended family in the photograph. I look at it with others. I look, and point out my aunt Lucretia Ralston, and a man who may be her husband Jim Ralston. I see my aunt Joanne Redding, and a half-dozen other faces that I know to be Reddings, but can't put a name to. I see my uncle Adam Redding, and several men next to him that I know are his friends. One or some of these men may be gay, and may be Adam's current or former boyfriend. I think: I know a lot of Reddings that would come to be prominent in this society.
