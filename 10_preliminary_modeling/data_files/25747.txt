 I walk into the basement of the student union at Brimson and go to the north side of the building. It is the end of the year. There is a party atmosphere. I see my dad sitting at a table. I'm surprised he is there. I go to talk to him. My roommate Stephen Ramos comes up behind me and jokingly pretends to have butt sex with me. I tell him not to since my dad is right there. I go over to the table where my dad is with a group of people eating. The lights in the room are dimmed. I meet my step mom's ex-husband Tyler Lawson, and we shake hands. He has a firm hand shake. I try to give a solid shake as well. He is a big strong man with a beard. My brother Wally is there with our high school classmate Holly Tanks, sitting at a table. Wally kicks the chair out form under Holly and she falls. He is joking. Tyler and I think this is inappropriate. Tyler stands up, which seems to be the polite thing to do, giving Wally a visual reprimanding. I go into the grille and order a Rueben. The grille is like Mason Cafeteria: the man gives me a Rueben on a plate from a big stack of Ruebens. I realize I don't have any money left on my student ID card, so I give the sandwich back. I'm in Billings Hall outside my friends' room. My friend Melvin Dahlheimer walks up the steps and into the room with a man who I think must be his father. Melvin tells me he and his friend they do Chemistry together, so it must not be his father. There is a woman in the room that I see when I enter. I don't know what she is doing there, but they don't pay her much attention. My friends Niles Zelling, Tom Napper and others are making a trip to the east coast: maybe New York or Washington D.C.
