In this dream as in many I was at my home in West Va. I was in the yard playing with one or two unidentifiable persons, when suddenly by the porch steps I saw a snake and it was a very brilliant shade of gold. In extreme fear, we ran into the house and slammed the door, breaking an orange and pink-colored vase. Later I looked out of the front window, the snake was still there and our yard had turned into an ice skating pond for in the distant part of it two persons were skating, unaware of the imminent danger which the snake represented. However, I awakened at this point before any harm had been committed by the ominous creature.
