Bob and his friends were throwing a football. I got hold of it and the cover was hanging on and it came off. The ball was nice and white. I asked Bob if I could give it one kick. I gave it one kick and it went so high. I don't remember even a batted baseball going so high. When it came down, it bounded about half as high as before. There was some kind of big insect making an air attack on us, but we finally got him. Alice, John and their mother had a funeral reception on their father who died. They even had an imitation hangman go thru the process of hanging the man, but something went wrong and some hot coals started to roll down towards the hangman and there was a catastrophe because a fire started and people went wild. We were held at bay by surrounding gunmen, but we finally got one of the gang to let us go. We were standing in a shadow and watched the soldiers go by us until one last one was going by. He saw us and we were put under arrest. We asked for permission to go hunting and we were granted it. There was a 7 lb. box of screws on the floor.
