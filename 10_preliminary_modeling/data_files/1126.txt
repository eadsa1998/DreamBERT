I am waving good-bye to a very dear friend. The distance between us is growing. I make the "I love you" sign with each hand and wave them at her. I feel bereft, alone, separated, and sad. Later, I am reunited with a friend. It is intense. It is a need. He and I just can't be apart. As we are reunited, a baby lunges across the water and throws itself at us in a sense of desperation. The baby needed us so badly, that she/he "walked on water," which is a miracle. One knee got wet. We are all so happy clinging to one another.
