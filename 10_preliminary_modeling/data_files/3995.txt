["Talking to Karen"]  I am standing to the left of Karen. She is seated. And slightly looking back toward me. I am explaining to her that Charla has a hard situation, where both her parents abandoned her. I understand that they had reasons for their behaviors, but that doesn't help Charla. She still feels abandoned. I feel sad for her.
