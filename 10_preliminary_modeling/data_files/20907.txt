I had to urinate. I urinated into a pond about 3 feet in diameter. A woman sat on either side of it. An Oriental man came and showed me where the restroom was located. Later a letter came from my aunt who is a nun. As I read it, I seemed to hear her voice saying the words. She was saying that we didn't have to fast any more during Lent. Her voice had an excited tone as she said the words. Enclosed in the envelope was a newspaper photo and it pictured a parade with a colored woman in the lead. She was a celebrity. My aunt said in the letter that her eyes were bad and she could not read the name of the celebrity. I showed the photo to a stout colored man who was standing nearby with a woman. He sneered and said, "What business is it of yours?"
