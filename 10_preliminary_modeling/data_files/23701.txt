I am in my room as it is in Tucson.  Visitors are there.  We three are sharing the bed.  But they keep rearranging the room, the pillows, the board under my bed is cut in half, half gone.  It is late.  I am getting annoyed.  Then Mom is there, taking clothes out of the closet, she wants just one dowel rod.  I am getting more upset, telling her to stop but she doesn't.  I remember the clock over on the windowsill.
