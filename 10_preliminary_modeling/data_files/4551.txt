["Bill Clinton's feelings are hurt."] I am in an office talking with people about starting a new magazine.. I have lots of ideas for themes and quickly write down 6 themes. I excitedly take them to the woman boss. I have a hard time convincing her of the merits of the first theme. I explain it to her. We will have lots of work to do. Now I decide to drive somewhere. I get into a black 4 wheel drive jeep and drive up a slushy snowy hill. As I reach the top, the jeep becomes a heavy sleek black wheelchair. I am now in a line of people waiting in a large room to be introduced to Bill Clinton. Finally it is my turn. He sits on a couch and I am seated in front of him. Some man says "with women" and Bill Clinton as a conversational starter says. "I was with a woman once." I laugh and say Oh REALLY?? Very sarcastic, joking him. His face clouds up and become frozen with anger. He glares at me. I realize my social mistake and quietly and sincerely apologize. I am so sorry. I repeat it twice. He slowly smiles again, but I'd made a big mistake laughing at him.
