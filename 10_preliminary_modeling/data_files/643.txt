A neighbor's house is on fire and we are living next door. We are in a hurry to get downtown as my daughter is somewhere else and wants a diet drink of some kind. she is in a hotel or something and can't get home. I can't find anything but black and white film and have trouble loading that. Then there is a problem that the fire is in the back of the house and won't make a good picture, but I find out the back is actually the front. The owner had it build that way on the lot. People are in our house. I am glad the house is burning because some Christians were going to buy it and they wouldn't let some other person who really wanted and needed it to have it. I never quite make it to take the picture because of one problem after another.
