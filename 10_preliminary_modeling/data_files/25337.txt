 My dad has left the kids, or has done something really bad in the eyes of society. It was in the newspaper. I'm in a house, which isn't mine. It seems to belong to someone who has more money than we do. My brother Wally, and maybe my sisters Heather and Ramona and my mom, have come to get me. The place seems like my aunt and uncle Elaine and Marvin Grains' house. We are all in the garage. We have some boxes of stuff to carry. It could be my stuff, since they've come to get me. All of them know of this bad act except me. I am very angry and upset. I ask them to tell me the full story of what has happened. Wally says he'll tell me later. I say no! I want to know now!!!
