I had a dream that I was at the Caan dining hall, which was actually my high school's dining hall. I don't remember why I was there. Aaron was there to see Britta. I saw Britta and kept trying to get a better look at her. I remember being disappointed by the cereal selection. I called Tyler to help me with the cereal. And then I saw Aaron again right before I woke up.
