In the dream I have fallen on hard times and I have to live in a squat in London. My mental health is not good, so I don't end up washing or eating properly. I turn up a a friend's house, where there is a gathering in a fairly cramped flat. We settled down on various mismatching seats and couches which are covered in blankets, to watch a film on the internet that apparently I have seen before and recommend to the others. It turns out that the film features me (the 'me' that has the squat and mental health issues). I remember looking down at my legs at one point, and noticing that they are bruised and that one of them has a huge blister on it. It looks like leprosy or some very serious skin disease. There's a scene in the film where I drive a car up some steps and smash through someone's front door and into their flat. The occupants run away from the car which is still moving, chasing them from room to room, smashing down the thin walls between them.
