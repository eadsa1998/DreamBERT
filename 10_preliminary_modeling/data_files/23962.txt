There was a party at Carrie and Tonys house. Somehow though the party was made up mostly of Jamison and his wife's friends - they seemed to be a part of a cult-like group of friends. There was a long hallway at Carrie's apartment. Actually it was much like mine but instead of walls to divide the bedroom, the hallway was wide enough that it fit the beds width-wise. There were three bieds in a row. The middle one was Carries and it had a tapestry hanging over it like a canopy that closed the bed off like a little tent/bed. The material was a rich electric blue with bright yellow stars. it almost looked like the inside of a genie bottle. Lots of pillow and blankets - everything matching. Tony was in bed under the sheets. Carlos' bed was on the right and near the wall. It was about 10 ft. from Carries. His bed was perfectly neat. The third bed on the left was the guest bed - it was all perfectly made and untouched. There wasn't really much else int he hall except for the beds. <br/
