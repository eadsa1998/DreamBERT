 I'm on a metro bus in Oak Valley. We're doing part of the loop around Home Avenue, Main Street, and 3rd Street, Last Avenue, and 2nd Street. I have my luggage with me, and am going home. I realize that I don't remember the flights to Los Angeles and to Metropolis. I can't remember traveling to get back home, even though I'm about to arrive. I ask several young boys on the bus where we are and how long we've been driving. They don't seem to know. I touch my surroundings to see if they are real: there are considerable inconsistencies that cause me to question my state of consciousness. I do not detect anything physically unusual. At one point I think I point at a car to see the energy in it, as Don Juan taught Carlos Castaneda, but I see nothing usual about the car. <br/
