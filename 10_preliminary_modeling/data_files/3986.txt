["Saving the Enterprise."]  The USS Enterprise is basically a huge body of water. I am a crew member. We must abandon ship. I am swimming up to the air. Capt. Jean-Luc Picard accompanies me to the surface and then turns to go back down to try and save the ship from exploding. He turns to his left and says "Michael." The Warf character is there. He also volunteers to go back down. They swim down to a sandy silt ledge where yet another crew member is pacing back and forth, guarding. His feet are silly, like a clowns. There are three objects down there and they are going to explode. Capt. Orders the others to go up to the surface with two of the objects. He stays behind to bring up the third one, the most dangerous. It is on the verge of exploding so he releases it and pushes it to the right. That momentum forces him into the same path. The thing explodes. I think the Capt. Survives.
