At a banquet: see XANDI (fiance from Vienna who died) walk in; he looks like when he was young; then he is older and has grey hair; I almost faint: "So you didn't die after all." We walk hand in hand; I tell him about my marriages; then we make love in a field; it becomes Frank: then I get a ride home; I carry a Negro baby, I see houses on fire; see the flames, but we get home OK. Wendy and Wally arrived by train, before we call the missing persons bureau... very happy; great sense of everything is O.K.
