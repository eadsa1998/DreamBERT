I asked Nate and Whistle which horses they would take from a list of 9 I had on a card that I picked from the entries. I went to bed and tried to dream which one or ones would win and Whistle said #3, which was Point Barrow and Nate said #1, which was Penny Achance. I was walking along barefooted with Bob and Audrey. We came by a small puddle of water and there were a lot of water bugs in it. Audrey told me to walk thru it, but I said, "No, those bugs are all germs." Then we were up in a tree with Kotnik. He put a rubber tube or hose in his pants and there was dirty, muddy water coming out of his body thru the hose into a tube beside him. The tube was full. He turned the hose on me and got my pants dirty and wet, then he turned it on Bob and got his face all muddy. I didn't like it. I cleaned Bob's face and we got off the tree and were going to get the car to go home. I called Audrey, but she stayed in the tree with Kotnik. Then I saw Bill Kotnik again draining himself of the mud again. I stopped at a gas station and the fellow wanted me to go to the left of the station to the gas tanks, but I said, "I can't get in there; it's too narrow." He wanted to bet me I could, so I said, "I'll bet you $55, no better $1000, that my car can't get in there," but he changed his mind. Later I proved to him it couldn't get in the narrow space. I drove my car to the edge of a cliff and stopped on time. It was dangerous.
