We lived in the country where there were wild game. We went outside. I got a flashlight and shined it on some monkeys that came near the house. Then I shined it into the brush and saw deer. Bob had an air rifle and went into the field and I told him to be careful at what he shot at. I was looking at all kinds of trinkets. I was taking some of them.
