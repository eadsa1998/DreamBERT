We are in another state. I remember staying with my paternal grandparents for the night. I was very cold there lying in bed next to my grandfather, and there seemed to be very few bed sheets. (Then, I remember some sort of "educational program" which didn't make sense to me after waking up). I got out of bed, and I remember standing there in the dark, very tired, and wondering if I'd begin to have hallucinations. I got back to bed, and my grandfather was pushed right along the edge of the bed. I asked him to push over and at last I had plenty of room to sleep. I am outside at a friend's birthday party playing volleyball. I have only socks on my feet, and see other people wearing the same. Everybody else has racquets to play volleyball with, but I don't. I go over some sort of tent or pavilion, and I see Paul. Someone asks him if Paul has known him for more than 2 years. Now I think it's his birthday, but it wasn't his party when this dream started. I am still under a tent, but now I realize there are all girls there. I didn't think I belonged there (not that I would be kicked out). I realized this when a coach started discussing the playing schedule of his volleyball or soccer team. I find myself in the kitchen of a restaurant, that seems to be in the general location of the party. I think the place was named after a fictional character. I didn't think I was supposed to be here either (I went the wrong way on the stairs and found myself in the kitchen) but some girl who works there didn't even notice as she was walking behind me. She said a few words out loud now and then but it seemed as if she was talking to herself. I could, however, telepathically catch the rest of her thoughts.
