I was camping outside in the snow.  Someone called to me from outside the tent, and I came out to find Kate Barrett apparently waiting at a bus stop nearby.  I went over to talk to her, wearing only boxer shorts, wading through the snow in my bare feet.  Our house was nearby, and my wife Anita called to me from the front door and told me to come.  I knew she was going to chastise me for talking to Kate in my boxer shorts, and I was conflicted as to whether I should just assert my right to do so.
