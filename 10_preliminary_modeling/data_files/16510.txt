I was going to stay over at Astrid's friend's house. There was Astrid and there was another girl that was like Astrid. And first of all, before any of that, I dreamt that I was making kind of a sculpture out of something I broke, and I was using really strong glue. And I put like a dinosaur head on the front of like a porcelain rock, and then I put a little tail on the side of it. I put a couple other things on it, and then this was going to sit on a bicycle. And I think it was really raining and really lightning and thundering and I couldn't really go with the girls to their house until it was done. But they were sitting on the porch swing with me, and Mom came home from a shopping trip and she was unloading groceries in the kitchen. And she was complaining about how the store wouldn't cash her out and she had to wait and wait because if the power goes out at the store, then they can't use their register. What else? I think somehow we got over to the girl's house and Astrid and the girl were going to build something. They had like shop tools out and like saws and sanders and vacuum cleaners. And I think in my dream Astrid had a little bit of vision, about like mine, and the girl had a little bit more than I do. And I was peeking in the dark in the bedroom for a hair clip to tie up my hair and then I woke up.
