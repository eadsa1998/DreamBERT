I was at the Technical College for today. Tristan and I went to Mr Hoover's class, but it was only us two. There were supposed to be three others, but they weren't here and had been absent the last few days too. It was in a small-ish lecture theatre that was very black. Mr Hoover said he'd have to move us to a different class because he couldn't teach a class of two (and the first activity was in a group of four). We had a big lecture on with another guy and I got there a bit late. I sat away from everyone else. I was next to a black girl who introduced herself and asked how old I was. I said 23, then went 'no, 25. Don't ask how that happened' and she looked at me funny and then said she was 26. I said everyone else was like 18, so I was glad there was someone older in here. The lecturer said that anyone who wanted to leave could and one guy got up and left and then heaps of people got up. The only people left were people from last year. I moved over to sit with them. Then it was a break and there were three toilets. Fletcher was still in the room. I went to the toilet over one side but there wasn't actually a toilet in there. I went to the middle one, but there was a wall missing and just a curtain to pull. I went to the furthest one and I think there was another issue with that one.
