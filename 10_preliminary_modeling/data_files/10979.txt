I was in an airplane which was trying to land on top of a car. All passengers were panic-stricken and speaking of death and what they had or had not accomplished in their lives. All accepted the inevitability of death. One man died of a heart attack and the woman next to him collapsed. I said that everyone should parachute out and, as I was falling, I awoke.
