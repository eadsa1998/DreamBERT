I was at 'school'. We were in science and had matches. Jeremiah had almost lit a match when Mr Reilly had some gas out. Darius threw a match away and I copied him. Someone realized that the room was going to blow up. Later, I walked back down to the room. Evelyn, Darius, Eugene, Elana and I were trapped in this room and these people wouldn't let us out and we were locked in. I was telling Calvin later. There was a flashback of some room. These people came in and were going to spray paint a cupboard. Then it was back to us and the door blew and had killed two people and we were laughing. We got out and it looked like West Whitehall Primary School. There was a hot dog stand and the sausages were in water.
