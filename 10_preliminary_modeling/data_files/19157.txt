Setting at school. In kidney lab with dog; Phyllis was operating. She had taken vaeteos out for collection of urine. Phyllis has operation all messed up. Was like procedure we use in lab. When she connected vaeteos, she did something wrong. She put both into a tube that ran back into the urethra of dog, and we didn't have any urine sample. We didn't want her to do next experiment Monday because she screwed up last experiment. Day residue: What Phyllis had actually done was a very bad operation and one experiment was screwed up, except she didn't connect vaeteos in actuality.
