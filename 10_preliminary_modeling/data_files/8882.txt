There were people riding around on little scooters made to carry three people on individual seats. They were supposedly three-wheel vehicles, but unlike in waking life, two wheels were in front and one was in back. The three seats were placed above each wheel. I was looking at them and told someone that one of these would be good for someone I know. I tried one but decided it didn't move very well because there was no back wheel. It was made that way on purpose. In place of the wheel there was something shaped like a suction-cup. Whoever I was talking to asked why I didn't want that one. I held it up and showed them the thing that was on there instead of a wheel and told them that it didn't move very well because of this. There was also a doctor visit involved.
