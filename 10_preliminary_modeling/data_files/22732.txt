I remember I dreamt that I was in my grandmother's house. It was the old house, with a yard. My mother, my cousin, my grandmother and I were there. Then a very strong tremor started and we all ran out because the house was so old, it looked like it would collapse. I was running, holding my grandmother's hand, to a nearby parking lot. Then my cousin (boy) got there and told us that it was dangerous to stay there and that we should go to another parking lot, further away. When we got there, two thieves told us to hand everything we had to them. Then I told them that how could they think that, after having left in such a hurry, we would be carrying valuable things with us. Then they went away. So we thought that they were going to find out which house was ours and, taking advantage of the fact we had left the doors opened, they would steal everything. It was then that I got into the house next door and through there into my own house and I closed everything. While I was closing down everything, my mother and my cousin arrived to help me. I had gone in through the other house so that the thieves wouldn't know which was ours. Having closed everything down, my mother went out through the door. We closed the door tightly and left by jumping a fence that led to the other house. We didn't stay in the house because it was in such a bad shape that it looked like it would fall down. I don't remember any more.
