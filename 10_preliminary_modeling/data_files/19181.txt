Jeff and I were sitting in the Pillbox discussing a physiology course. We were sitting there for a while and decided we didn't particularly like some of the lectures and we weren't clear. Dr. Paff came in and said that he was going to lecture next week on neurophysiology, and I had kind of ambivalent feelings about this. I felt maybe that he shouldn't lecture, but if he did, it would be clearer. I'd understand the lecture better than the lectures we've been having so far. We were sitting in the Pillbox. The Pillbox is a little meeting area where they have tables and chairs and there's a little place where you can buy sandwiches at the Medical School. I had ambivalent feelings toward Dr. Paff because I was afraid of his grading and his attitude, his aggressive attitude, although I do like his way of teaching better than the lectures we've been getting which are kind of fuzzy, not understandable. Dr. Paff left. This is the last thing I remember in the dream. We were sitting there around one of the formica tables there in the Pillbox and Chuck and I were both in our school clothes, white pants and shirt, and Dr. Paff was in his usual attire of blue--blue tee shirt and blue pants. When he left, he put on his little straw hat. The strain was largely day residue. The physiology we were discussing, we just had a physiology test and we spend most of our off time in the Pillbox, being a coffee shop we go in there and have coffee every day. We were in there today.
