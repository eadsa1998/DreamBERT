I was at Nana's. It was March or something but it was Christmas. I was at the table next to the kitchen with Dad, Nana and Poppa. I think Dad said I did "super duper" in the MUPC. I said I got high distinctions and they were like 'good' but no-one said much. Dad said I got the top mark in human biology. Aunt Sally arrived and then Nana wanted to take a photo of us. We went outside and some guys took the picture and I remember seeing Nathaniel with us. I was annoyed because I wanted them to take a picture when I had lost weight.
