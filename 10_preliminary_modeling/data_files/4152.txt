I am in a driveway with a woman and Lucy. I am handing Lucy cards. She stares at it and then I tell her what's on it. I then remember that she is totally blind. I feel stupid doing this and embarrassed. The woman suggests we go to a store that is down a steep dirt path. I say not now. I am interested in the clothes they sell there but I am worried about if the path is accessible or not. Later I change my mind. I call Lucy and ask if she can come over and help me go to the store. She says sure. Justin is home all afternoon. I remind her not to be late because it is 2:30 PM and the store will close and I need to take my pickup to get more gas. They come over. Lucy and my father get in the back of the pickup. I help them get comfortable. I ask Justin if there is enough room for him. He says no (even though there was). So Justin and their child get up in the front seat. I am driving. We go to someplace where there is a mechanic. He will fix some part of the pickup that has been broken for a long time.  Two men are there talking about the event that is going to happen on the huge snow field right in front of us. I decide I want to get a good seat, so Justin and I go to a corner on the left of the snow field. I park my wheelchair. I decide it will be too uncomfortable sitting in the chair for a long time, so I put my purse on the ground and then I scoot out of the chair and to the ground in front of the foot pedals. I am crowded and uncomfortable. I move the purse to the chair seat. I tell Justin he can sit in my chair. I am worried that my chair and me take up too much space.
