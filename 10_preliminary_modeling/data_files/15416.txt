I was at the old house. I had a small grey bird called Andrew Bird and it came when you called it. Ezra was out the back looking worried and drunk. Dad said this girl he slept with was pregnant and we were shocked and saying that he'd ruined his life. Iinet had different internet bandwidth graphs that were squiggly and told you the percentage of download from each person.
