I dreamed about known and unknown people. The known people are my friends from the university with whom I get together every day. The girl I am in love with was the center of my dream. It started with the memory of when I was with her, of how she behaved towards me, kindly. I felt I was at her side. I saw myself talking to her in the distance and the whole world was watching us play nicely. I ran after her and caught up with her. Then I had her catch up with me. I threw myself on the floor. When I looked to see if she was behind me, I didn't see anybody. I heard murmuring around me. When I turned to see who was talking, there was no one. I saw her in the distance, signaling me to come. I went towards her, but didn't reach her side. My dream ended when I awoke at the moment I was going to catch her. She was waiting for me with open arms.
