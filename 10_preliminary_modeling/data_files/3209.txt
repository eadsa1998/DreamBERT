My parents are moving five miles east of A City, near M City in L City. I think maybe I might move there, but then I remember it's a smaller town and only one main street. I'd not be as entertained there as I am in E City downtown, with places to be. But it might be nice to go back, revisit the emotions that town brings to me. So I'm going to help them move, I think. I get in the car, which is a VW bus. My father says, "You sure drive that well." I say, "I learned how to drive on one of these." Now Rochelle is driving and we are going up the coast. The ocean is on the left. We are going to M City to visit. A TV crew is preparing to tape something. A man crew member does two jobs. He is right now creeping up to something with a cardboard he sometimes wears like a disguise or a sign, with a hole cut out for his face. Now we are still driving. A young girl is concerned, a man is like a lawyer or judge and they are trying to determine if the girl has been sexually abused. The man says, "Maybe she hasn't, and just thinks she has." Now I have a "memory flash" A hand is beckoning me from an attic room. I am maybe 5 or 6 years old and my family is temporarily living with another family, a black family, and everyone is gone for now. I go up the stairs to this attic room and the man is smiling and says, "Come on in, let me show you around." I go in and there is a couch, bed thing and he lays me on that and talks dirty and plays with himself. His wife comes in and talks, like nothing much is going on. Maybe it wasn't so awful, then. Then I feel sexual excitement and masturbate to orgasm, feeling a little guilty that I should enjoy such stuff.
