I was putting up my outdoor Christmas decorations. The outside of my house looked different than in waking life. As I was starting I either thought or said that I knew exactly how I wanted to do it. Once I got started I said I didn't know how I wanted it. I think I had an extension cord out but no lights. I was trying to figure out where to put the Nativity scene. I didn't want the lights from it to bother any of the neighbors. I was also trying to decide if I wanted it in the front yard where my neighbors might enjoy it most or if I wanted to put it on my patio where I would enjoy it most. It seems that I had left some of the figures standing all year because I pulled them out of the ground. As I was doing that I noticed there were small, white, porcelain angel figurines that had gotten buried in the dirt. There were two or three of them. They had each gotten buried separately but in a row.
