Before Batman Begins had come out, there had been a TV show with Christian Bale playing Batman. I watched a bit and saw him (I hadn't been sure it had Christian Bale in it). I was then at Mom's and Austin was singing Yellow Submarine. Ezra was there too and I was discussing something with him. These two guys, who were friends, were at some place and they fell in love. Then I was one of them and was hiding under a bed. There were lots of beds around, with beds underneath them.
