I left a department store and came into an alley. Some little girls were there, but I avoided them. I walked through a wooded area and I saw more little girls on the path. They seemed carefree and gay. Two of them flashed their eyes at me. I noticed the legs of some others. I felt tempted to become friendly with them, but I resisted. (When I awoke, I felt anxiety as I recalled the dream. Yesterday I read from "Human Destiny" by Leconte du Nouy that Darwin was wrong about natural selection. It was not the fittest that survived, but the most adaptable to change in environment. The dinosaurs were the fittest of their time, but became extinct when the climate was modified. I related that thought with my own inability to adapt to adulthood, and I believe that is why I felt so anxious. It made me ponder that adaptability is more essential to my survival than fitness or power to seduce. My power is useless if I can't adapt to adulthood.)
