 I'm in a basement study room in the Brimson library with my roommate Stephen Ramos, classmate Shawn Tryner, and others. They are being loud: repeatedly slamming the door. I get mad at them and tell them to shut up. Two librarians come down and kick us out. I'm angry because I didn't' do anything wrong, and tried to get the others to calm down. As I pick up my things to leave, I smart off to the librarians and tell them to kiss my ass. I spill a mug of tea on the floor and feel stupid. I wipe the tea up, but it is going to leave a stain. I shrug this off, and am on my way. My classmate Heather Madly is outside the study room. The woman from Holy University who is in my religion class is on the floor. Her leg is sticking up. We flirt, and I tickle her foot. I feel foolish and immature after I stop ticking her. She wants to use the phone.
