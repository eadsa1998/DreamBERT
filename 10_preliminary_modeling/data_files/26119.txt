 I'm in the Big Resort Area with four people, including my friends Beth Mock and Tim Zelling. We have scuba gear and may be scuba diving. There is a woman in a sky blue motorboat. She lives in the boat. One of the men we are with wants to go slow on our trip. The weather is nice. I say okay: it's a nice day, we'll go at a leisurely pace. My uncle Rusty Redding's canoe starts to leak. There are two others in it with me. I flip off the end of it and tell Tim to start bailing. The front of the canoe bends, and Tim tries to collect the water and bail it quickly.
