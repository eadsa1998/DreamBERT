This dream was rather short involving only a few incidents, but was one of the most terrifying dreams I've had. At the start of the dream I was standing alone on a wooded hillside. The area seemed to have been burned over and stumps of trees dotted the landscape. Suddenly a wild boar appeared on the scene. Its face was generalized, but the white tusks showed. The boar started chasing me and I ran for dear life. As I ran the tusks moved closer and I was sure that I would be gored. With the boar at my heels I barely managed to get behind a tree and my heart felt as if it was going to stop from fright. At the side of the wood I noticed a piece of machinery with a flat surface and a vertical saw. The boar climbed up on the machine and was sawed in half. An elephant then appeared and swallowed the boar whole like a snake. The elephant then stretched out its legs and I woke up.
