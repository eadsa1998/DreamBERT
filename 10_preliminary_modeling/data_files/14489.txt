I was at home. There was a door in the kitchen leading out the back but it had been blocked for years. Tinkerbell and Tigger were outside and I let them in. I went to my room and it was clean, but still a bit messy. My shutters were open and so all the light was natural light. There were pillows and cushions on the floor as well as a giant slug. The latest episodes of House and Lie to Me were out. This girl dropped something in a bin and Jennifer Morrison got it, I think it was drugs. Later, she was with Chase (House) and she was giggly. House found it in the bin.
