I don't know where it took place but in my dream I think I knew somewhat where I was. There was a friend of mine. We are friends but don't ever do anything outside of school. I was walking by the pool when I saw my friend at the bottom laying face down. I freaked out and it turned out she had died there. She had gotten drunk and was out of control and couldn't swim because of it, so she drowned. No one really did anything about it because they didn't want to touch the dead body. When I woke up I was freaked out.
