I was dressed as a bride. I was wearing a long and white dress, whose train was so long it almost reached the cathedral's door. I was getting married, but I was crying and telling my mother that I didn't want to get married because, being married, I couldn't go to school or feel at home with my friends. My mother was trying to calm me down, saying, "No, darling, you're still going to see your friends," but I said, "I won't be able to go to school; I want to study." As the ceremony went on, I kept crying and trying to see the face of the man I was marrying, but I couldn't see past his shoulders, even when I made an effort; I couldn't see his face. He had a black dinner jacket on, white shirt and a small bow tie. In the church there were many elegantly dressed people. My mother was trying to encourage me to get married so that I wouldn't stand up the bridegroom. At that moment I woke up, almost crying. The cathedral where the wedding was taking place was familiar to me.
