I went into some place with Dad, Poppa and others. Michael Palin and an old guy were there. There was a new Monty Python movie and I said that it was weird they'd made a new movie without Graham Chapman. We went to see it and there was footage from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. A girl there, who was my age, was going out with the afore-mentioned old guy. I wasn't sure how they were connected. We ended up at some nightclub and everyone was dancing. I was then at some college and it was very busy inside. I was on a staircase and there were people everywhere. I was then outside. Some friends and I were having races. Pam and Jim from The Office were there. Pam was called 'Nick' though. Pam, this other guy and I raced for fun. She was fast and won and I was second. The last part of the race was down some stairs and then back up. Then there was a pool with those green plants, but you had to swim across it. Only people with 'nice butts' were allowed. Pam used to be allowed, but wasn't anymore. She was writing in a diary. I went to do something and walked along the walkway on the 'butt' pool. I went up to Pam and tapped her on the shoulder and said that I was just in the butt pool and she said "this is the best thing ever!" and started writing again. The lady in charge came and I hid and she said that Jim was never allowed in and that she didn't notice me because she 'forgot she was here'. James Lafferty was also there and he was allowed in the pool.
