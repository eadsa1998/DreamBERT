I dreamt that I went to Chicago with my sister and my brother-in-law. When we got there, the city was just one big, tremendous, big statue carrying after another, really fantastic, just big statues of people from Greek mythology, and a few other things, like lions. But these things were all just tremendous, and it seemed natural, like this was a regular part of the Chicago landscape. And then we were there for a while, and then we left, and for some reason I was riding on the back of the car. And we got out of there and, oh yes, we were going to go in to visit one of these big, gigantic statues, visit inside of it. We pull up and I go inside. I missed them. I don't know where they went, meaning my brother-in-law and my sister. And I went over to like a Greyhound bus man ticket agent and tried to get a ticket, but he kept truing to give me a ticket to leave the place there.
