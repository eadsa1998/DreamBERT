I was working on Daddy's video at the computer, particularly the part with Kaitlyn S in it. I kept trying different things trying to find the thing I liked, or trying to decide what I liked best. After working with it for quite some time I realized I didn't want the expense of having a new version put on DVD so I stopped.
