I dreamed that Jenny had a skating accident. My brother went paintballing in Switzerland. I also dreamed that everyone from my Spain group was at the refuge, and this giant snake was slithering around the room and I was just freaking out. But then Tom told me it was OK, and that it was actually Ben who was the snake. Then Ben turned him into a human, and I was so relieved. He told me the history of this witch put a spell on him when he was two years old so that he could only be human half of his life, and then he had to be a snake for the other half. Megan and I thought that was very sad, and then I woke up.
