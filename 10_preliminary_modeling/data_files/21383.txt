I walked thru Farkash's yard and there was a loaf of bread the size of a bushel basket. Then I walked to the front porch and there were the loaves of home-baked bread, large ones, big ones and some were shaped or baked around a shoe. One around a rubber. This was a home bread bakery. I was called to work to a steel mill and a fellow way in front of me was throwing bolts at me. I found out I was to take over a yard job of one of the employees, which was a very good-paying job. I told the boys I was not going to take the job if I was going to take someone else's job that had seniority. Here, I said, I am called back at White Sewing Machine Co. I have 31 years of service there. I looked at a paper and I saw names of winners. One was $99.60, but I can't recall the name now. I cannot get a paper. The papers are on strike now.
