Bev was getting married and I was in the wedding party. I was sitting in front of a table and something was dripping down on my dress as a result of something that Jody S had done. The whole front of my dress, from the waist down, it was kind of a yellow or pale color dress, whatever it was that was dripping down had almost completely covered the front of my dress in a bright red or orange. I went someplace and was going to take it off for a little while. Jody S or someone was going to wash and dry it very quickly. They thought we could get it done on time. But then, they ended up having me sit, like on the edge of a bathtub and they just showered me off while I still had the dress on. All of this stuff came out. It was a very lightweight fabric so it air-dried in time. But then something else happened and there was I thought it had just put a little mark on the front of the dress, like 2 or 3 inches long. But it ended up being a tear. It was kind of like two layers of fabric. Like maybe chiffon over satin. This had torn through both layers. I was very upset again. Someone told me not to worry about it that it really wasn't noticeable. But then later it was like a whole big section of the under layer fabric torn out and just ragged edges and stuff. For some reason, related to someone else, I kept saying we've got to get to the church. The Wedding Mass was supposed to start at 1:00 pm and it was just twenty minutes til. They said, no problem. It will only take us ten minutes to get there. We'll be there ten minutes ahead of time and you're all ready anyway. So it's not a problem. But something happened and we didn't leave. Now it was just ten minutes til and they said, that's alright. We'll still get there on time. Then it was five til and we hadn't left yet. Then it was five after. Then it was twenty after.
