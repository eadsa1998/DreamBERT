I was somewhere and the school was there too. There were two evil people, but one was actually good. Their master had gone crazy and there were two options: let him destroy the world or kill him. They lost their power. They were running through a forest and they had a force field around it, but then it was gone. It was dark and weird at the front of the place. The people across the street couldn't see us. I was in this room and I was climbing up these stairs, but these evil people were coming so I hid behind this shelf. They came and the not-evil one came too. The good one saw me and tried not to let the evil people see. My hand was visible to them. An evil one saw it and said "Here kitty, kitty, kitty" and I knocked them out and ran. We were then sitting on these steps. Silas was sitting close to me and I was like 'ew, get away'. This guy pulled on my bag and I let myself fall backwards and kicked him in the head. Harlan was being gay. This guy looked like James Spader. A friend of Ezra's was sitting nearby. Dad picked us up. Ezra went in the front. It was my turn in front and I had my iPod.
