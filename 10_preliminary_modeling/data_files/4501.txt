["Velvet yellow and green keys on accordion."] I am on a bus like a city bus. With family (only I don't know these people in real life.) The bus is very crowded. Many people crowd on. My mother has to stand. Dovre is there. A small girl who is mentally retarded and is related is there. I see "video" pictures of family gatherings. I see my face all angry and upset because she leaned on me and it hurt. I see some other similar scenes of unhappy people at family gatherings. I comment that oh well, sometimes it happens. No family is perfect. Life goes on. The girl wants my attention and I reluctantly give it. I am standing up and amazed I can do so without pain. I am starting to feel tired. The girl has an accordion she used to play I stroke the velvet keys, yellow and green they are. I show her how to pick out a tune. I like the accordion and want her to give it to me. Dovre is shocked I would take it from her as it is an important memory thing for her. I am a bit callous and figure she won't miss it for long. I look out the window and we are traveling down a narrow one lane road. The trees almost form a tunnel exactly big enough for the bus to get through. I see large black animals with huge snouts and tusks. I call out to "Dad" and say look at the pig dogs. He stretches in order to see out the back window and sees them. We are passing through an old town, maybe one I know. I look for landmarks I would recognize. Maybe the old house we used to live in. Now I'm at "home" and unpacking. A piece of round moss from Dovre, some old ballet slippers and I put these things on a shelf in a bowl to keep them as keepsakes. I am trying to show Dovre I really care.
