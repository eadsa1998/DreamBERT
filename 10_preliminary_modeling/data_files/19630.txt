My car, a roadster, is backed obliquely against the south curb of Pennsylvania Ave., between 9th and 10th Sts. A parade is soon to go by, and great crowds of people line both curbs. There are various obstructions in the street, apparently temporary stands. There are no other cars in sight and I am about to drive mine away. There is a cop in the street and I conclude that he will think I have made a prohibited U-turn, if I start out at once. Next, I invite a girl (unknown) to accompany me and she gets in car. I offer to go anyplace she wishes, and I explain that I have no plans of my own. We start out, though it seems doubtful that I can get between some of the stands; in fact, in making a sharp turn around one of them the rear of my car caught in a red and white cotton blanket. I do not stop and the blanket (evidently belonging to one of the spectators in the stand) pulls free. On reaching 10th St., it seems impossible to squeeze my car around the corner; and in imagination I could see the left rear of my car hooked on to something on the corner (?lamp post). Apparently I do not make the turn, but nevertheless I soon find myself on 10th near the Museum, but realize there can be no parking here; and take car onto a side street, that is near Old Center Market.
