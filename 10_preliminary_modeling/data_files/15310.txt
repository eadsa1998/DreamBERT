There was something to do with kissing. A guy had been bad to his girlfriend? We told him off. A guy paid over $800k for a girl and someone said something about me. Owen Wilson was looking for some girl and four of us hid in a room. He opened the door, which was like a sheet, but he didn't come all the way in and didn't see us. He left and we giggled, but called him back and the girl came to see him and they united. I saw a car and realized it was Eugene's and saw him in it. Later, I saw his computer and wanted to go on it and see what was on it.
