Howard and I are at a campsite. I say, "Hey, let's talk about the kids and not always fight." He agrees. It was friendly. There was a slight sense of me being on guard. Howard was standing near the open door of the cab of the red pickup. I was standing near him. Chuck sees him and comes up. "Oh, who's this?" he says curiously. "This is my ex-husband, Howard." Chuck looks at me like, "Shall I protect you?" I look at him like, "No, it's O.K."
