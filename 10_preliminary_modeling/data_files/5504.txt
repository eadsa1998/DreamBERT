I dreamed that I was in Alaska on a beautiful, bright blue, stretch of water, I don't know if it was a lake or a river and I was paddling a kayak, and the front of it was about 10, or 12 feet long, and the back was equally long and I don't think I had a double bladed paddle, I think it was just a single blade like a canoe paddle and I was just moving along on this lake and it was just absolutely gorgeous.
