I was walking toward a very large swimming pool. Many people were bathing as I approached the pool. I was ready to go in the pool and all of a sudden I noticed the water was very, very muddy and dirty. I jumped in anyway and I was glued to the mud. After a short time I saw the water draining out. Before I awoke I was standing in the pool.
