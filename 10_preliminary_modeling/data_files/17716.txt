Someone had a large scimitar-like sword.  He had me standing against the wall.  He was going to cut my head off.  He wanted to watch me struggle, but I refused, and remained motionless while he pushed the sharp edge into my neck.  Fortunately the edge was sharp so I didn't feel the cut, just the blood loss and the inability to hold my head up as the muscles and nerves were severed.  This happened several times.    <p
