I dreamed there were hundreds of airplanes flying over our house, which was transferred into a new setting. I stood over a broad field to watch the planes. They were a very peculiar shape which I can't describe but can draw--. I guess I can't even do that but can still see them there in my minds eye. They were yellow and, black and flew en masse in a seemingly unending supply. I remember vaguely that a man jumped out of one of them and parachuted down to earth. I approached him when he landed. He stuck his foot through the silk and tore the chute badly. I think I contemplated that the material would have been nice for a nightgown or slip.
