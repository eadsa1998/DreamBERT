 There is an airplane flying. I have a view outside of the plane, into one of its windows. It is getting dark and the lights in the cabin are on. There is a person, which may be me, hanging from the edge of a window outside the plane. I feel the grip the person has on the window. The person moves along, hanging from different windows, moving towards the back of the plane. The person finds a window that has a good grip. The person knocks on the window with their right hand, to signal for help! No one is seated next to the window. A woman with short dark hair, who reminds me slightly of my coworker Lauren, is sitting across the aisle from the window. She notices the knock, but looks over as if it is impossible anything is outside the plane. The woman eventually comes over to the window or realizes, to her horror, that there is someone outside the plane! When she realizes this, the engines of the plane fly into reverse to slow it down so they can bring the person in through the window. The people inside the plane roll the inner window down and somehow get the outer window off. The mother of the person outside the plane, who is a girl, is inside the plane. The mother has long straight blond hair. The girl climbs in through the window. I feel myself climbing in through the window. The girl hugs her mother. <br/
