 There is a time scheduled for some young women to move out of their apartment where they are being abused. I go to the building an hour before the time to leave. It is 5:00 pm. The set time for leaving is 6:00. When I drive by and go in, I hear a girl, who I know is my sister Heather's friend, arguing with a man. My friends Nicole Peterson and Tammy Jostens are in the same building, and are also leaving. One suggests to the other that she reads until it is time to go.
