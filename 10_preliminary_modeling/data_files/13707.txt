Some band had done a song with Buddy Holly and the Crickets. I discovered that Ryan Cartwright was dead and looked him up on IMDb. They didn't have a death date on there, but I worked out that it was on March 2. I was reading posts on the message board and he had been murdered. People suspected his mother. I was doing heaps of washing. Acquaintance-M-01 called. Dad asked me what job would suit him and I said "Computer... analyst?", but that was what Acquaintance-M-01 was, and Dad was only saying it so he would stop asking him questions, so we had to think of something else.
