 I'm in a plane with my girlfriend Annie and other people. She and I are sitting in the back. We need to get the parachute out. It is built into the seat in front of us. We are skydiving, but not by choice. We have to throw one parachute out and then jump after it. We don't know how to skydive. We jump and try to grab the parachute. I am then observing the dream. I see two bodies and one parachute in the distance. One body falls; I know it is Annie's. I must have grabbed the parachute. Our goal was to cling to each other so we both could make it safely to the ground. I either wake up, or realize I am dreaming and rewind the dream, until the two bodies are together in the air again.
