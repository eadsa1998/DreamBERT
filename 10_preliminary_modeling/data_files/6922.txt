A young girl and boy, shabby and pale, came to the door and I asked them in and gave them most of a large roll of pancakes that M. hadn't wanted. Ate a bit of it with them but thought, "that's not much of a lunch when we have such a light supper." They had no money, had had none for some days. I thought I'd ask mother if we could keep them overnight or until he found work. I went to look for her. R. told me mother had gone somewhere for a few weeks but planned to visit home occasionally. R. thought we could put up the children. I asked the boy how old he was. "16" and how far in school? I told R. I thought we could put up the boy all right. He could sleep with one of the boys in their room. I tried to think where we could put the girl for the girl's room was so crowded.
