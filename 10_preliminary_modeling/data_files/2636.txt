I'm staying overnight in a house. There is a dispute going on between the female neighbor and the male owner. They are hassling each other and I'm caught in the middle. For example, he calls on the phone and let's it ring repeatedly. This interrupts my attempts to sleep. I get up and the woman comes in with ducks and geese and let's them wander all over the house. I know they will poop all over. I say, "I'd like you to leave now," and she pretends she's forgotten the geese and ducks and says she'll be back Tuesday morning. I ask her to take the fowl home now. I don't want to be the accidental victim of their "war" and try not to get drawn into it. It's hard not to.
