In a candy store. An old woman sobbing on the phone: "I can't hear what you are saying," she keeps repeating. I get mad and leave. Meet a friend--acquaintance from Iowa--and slap him on the shoulder in a friendly way. He slaps me hard on my left breast. I get a sharp pain in my nipple. Am I pregnant? (I ask in the dream).
