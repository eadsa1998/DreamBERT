I was at school. I was waiting for Calvin to come so we could open the time capsule, but he never came. I went to form, which was in some weird place, and this girl gave me the notices. I was alone in the room. When we left, I saw Elijah lining up outside a classroom, which was next to the library [there is no building next to the library] and I joined him. We were doing our practical chemistry exam. We all went in and were given a sheet of paper with experiments on it. The first one involved a Bunsen burner. Autumn did it for me. I had a CD with my music on it. We put it on and Hot in the City was playing. I was reading a list of songs on it, which included Daydream Believer, We Didn't Start the Fire and Strangelove [they were all in my playlist at the time, except for Strangelove which I hadn't heard before]. The next experiment involved seeing how much leg fat you had, which would tell you how many volts your leg could handle by putting these resistor things on your leg. Jeremiah volunteered to do it and we stuffed up and he got electrocuted, but it was only "640V" and he was ok. Mr Reilly got Eugene, Bradley, Darius and Alejandro to do it. Darius wrote on the board "I'm Haley, I'm city and country". Johanna was then there and made a joke and no-one laughed.
