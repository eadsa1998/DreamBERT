I was playing Runescape with Ezra and Ryan. In 'real life', Ryan, Lloyd (Entourage) and I tried to show Ari (Entourage) we were a good team. We ran to his office. There was chocolate and Ari ate some. There was a car and some girls said it was some colour and we said it was pink. The card said it was pink. I dropped my wallet and heaps of $1 coins rolled on the floor. An old lady was in her car and she gave it away. Then we were on Runescape and there were some new interactions and I was doing some to Ryan to get achievements. One was 'erecting'. People were after some French thing which I had something to do with and they chased me. I was hiding. I went to the shop with Dad and took a toothbrush. We went to the carpark and someone called him a "toothbrush". I said I didn't have one and then took it out of my pocket and threw it. He looked for it as we drove out.
