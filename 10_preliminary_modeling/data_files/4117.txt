I am acting in a small scene with a woman director. My role is to dive into a swimming pool and swim around. I do that. Then I get out and say to the director I have some suggestions to make about making the scene more dynamic and energetic with small quick edited scenes. She is not interested. She plans on doing two or three static scenes and that's it. I say to her I'm not trying to tell you your business but I am a playwright and she can use the suggestions or not, as she wishes. I am now in a large empty foyer of a public building which could be a church or a dormitory. There are large double doors that are open. People are trying to come in and I don't like that. I am trying to keep people out. A crazy man rushes in. I try to get him out but  can't. So I go outside. I am standing near some storage sheds. A woman drives up and asks me for the key. I say I don't have the key. She is angry at me because she knows I have the key and she wants to store some small object. A man is with her and he comes up close to me, in a threatening way. He looks me in the eyes and says Look at this. His left nostril changes shape and becomes large and flat. His right ear does the same. From these spots he sends psychic energy out that creates a blue plastic cylinder which begins to move toward me in a threatening way. I am afraid and run back to the inside of the building I was in. I try to shut the doors. The crazy man is still there. He and I are now pounding a rhythm on a wall as a part of a performance of a play in the next room. He complements me on my "monologue" or solo part. He wants to see the play and I tell him it is five hours long. He says no problem. He and I seem to be friendly now.
