I dreamed that I was with my friend A and I really don't know where we were and she was showing me pictures of herself and her family, dozens and dozens of them and after a while I was incredibly bored and I thought that she would never stop and we were beside a road and 2 boys, probably 12 to 15 years old, were pulling one of those bright red coaster wagons which were so popular when I was younger, and in these wagons were little children, 3, 4, 5 years old and they were just laughing and screaming and having a wonderful time and the bigger boys who were pulling the wagon, let go and gave them a push and my friend and I stood there frozen, not knowing what to do. It turned out okay, nothing happened to the small children.
