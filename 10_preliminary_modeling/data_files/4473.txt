["Unhelpful Triple A man."] I am in the passenger side of the van. I hired a man to help drive it. I feel a shimmy in the front wheels like a tire trying to work itself off an axle. He stops the truck suddenly on the side of the road. He refuses to drive it another inch. It's too dangerous he says. I look ahead and see we are about to enter a tunnel going down with a left turn in it. I see why he stopped. It would be terrible to have it break down in the tunnel. It would stop traffic and inconvenience everyone. But I am also annoyed because I think we could make it. It's a calculated risk. He is adamant. We get out of the truck and are now sitting in a cafe at a table. Other people are coming in and out and sometimes sitting with us. Women with babies. I have Charla and other children with me. I say to the man you can't just leave us here. We have to finish the journey. He doesn't respond. I then remember I could call Triple A. Then I remember he is a representative of Triple A. He could call and get a tow truck and a vehicle for us to travel in. He walks down a very steep ramp and I follow, nearly falling as it is so steep. He seems to be looking for a tow truck. I follow him, frustrated. Now he goes back up, disappearing. I go back to the cafe and now I have lost my place at the table. The cafe is crowded. No place for me to sit. And Charla and the children are missing. I am worried and annoyed. I decide to check the bathroom. I look at the bathroom door to see if I can find the Women's room. The sign is confusing. A woman comes out so I decide it is the women's room. I go in. A mesh screen is over the toilet. No children or Charla. I go out again, worried.
