I was with Nick R. We were living together and sharing a bed but I don't know if we were married or not. I told him I would now need to know what his name really is. He said it is R Williams. We were living in a house in the country. It was very small with maybe 4-5 rooms but I only remember two of the rooms. There were curtains in the doorway between the two rooms. The one small room was divided by a partial wall. I used it for storage. I had to bend over to go through the doorway into that space. There was a window in that space. Before moving into the house, we talked about the fact that we would need to add plumbing. We were talking about the kitchen. There were several people. Kim H, Jody S, Matthew, some other young man, and a young woman who was kind of our housekeeper. Three groups of really rough looking men came into the house without knocking on several occasions. After the last group did this, Nick R left the house with a shovel and something else and I was afraid of what he might be planning to do. He was very angry. He killed and buried several of the men after swearing to me he was done with the Mafia and their ways. He came back dressed kind of like an Indian. He said he put them all in the ground. I was so disappointed in him. Something else happened and we were saying that we needed to go after someone. No one else would so I got on a horse bareback, even though I didn't know how to ride. I had a lot of trouble getting on the horse. I finally did and then chased after that person or those people. We rode to church for Ash Wednesday morning Mass in a wood carriage, like you would see in an old western movie, pulled by a horse. Myself, Matthew, Kim H, and Jody S all went. Nick R didn't go.
