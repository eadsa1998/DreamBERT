[1997-05-21] I dreamt that my apartment was a basement apartment and it had a door, like a trap door, very strange. My parents were over there, visiting for some odd reason, and there was a big bear in the corner for some reason, my dad said that it had snuck in for some reason, and my parents left for a few minutes and the bear came to see me, it walked around me and went out the door. Then my sister arrived with a few of her friends and her little dog who just died, and it kept on growling and biting people and she was evidently somebody else's dog, and there were three cats there and they were all around my sister, my sister doesn't like cats, very strange.
