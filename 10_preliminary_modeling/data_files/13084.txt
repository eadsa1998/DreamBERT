I was somewhere and I started crying. Dad and Ezra were there too. All these randoms started hugging me. Later I went to school and my hair wasn't straightened. I was in the 'science room' and Silas and a bunch of people were laughing at my hair. I got this torch and left. I went up a hill and left. We had a new house. I forgot my keys. I called Mom and then noticed the back door was unlocked. I saw two Spaceman's. There were cracks in the middle of the walls. I told Mom and she said it was a burglar, but she didn't want to be bothered because Slater was going to die today from tuberculosis. Clayton was around.
