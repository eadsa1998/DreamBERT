I am laying down in a car (station wagon type) with blankets and pillows like a bed. I realize that men are going to try and break in and I reach over to lock the doors. A man intends to hurt me. I get out of the car and run. They chase. I go into my house and try to lock doors. I call 911 and hide under the telephone table. The woman who answers the phone is a nurse. She's impersonal and taking her time. I ask her to tell the police to come to 837 A. Street. [the names Steven V and Victor, a feeling of lots of mean men are out to hurt me. [BL]
