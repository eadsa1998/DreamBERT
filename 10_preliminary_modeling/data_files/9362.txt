I'm with my friend Jean and I have a sack of objects--it is a clear plastic sack and I can see the inside--rocks, rolls, buns, washers, bolts, and little blocks of wood that children build with. Jean has on hiking boots of high, old-fashioned buttoned and laced ladies' boots of 1890-1915. She has golf clubs. We have a bet. She says I can have all of something valuable, vague but desired, if I can get all into one boot in one stroke. I know it is impossible , so I negotiate. We finally agree that if I can get two objects into one boot in one stroke, I win. She takes off the boots and lays them on their side. I watch her and then study the boots to see which has opening at top easiest to enter. I take two little rocks out of the sack, round and about same size as golf balls. I get ready to swing the golf club when the dream ends.
