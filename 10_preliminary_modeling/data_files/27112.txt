In this dream I remember hearing the news that my mother had died. I remember feeling very upset, at the news. I don't know who told me the news, but soon after I heard it, the telephone rang and I heard my father's voice. He called to tell me about my mother. When he spoke to me, I felt very sorry for him and suddenly pitied him because he would be alone. When he spoke of my mother, I thought of her and at this point had an intense emotional outburst of tears. Later I remember sensing a fear and dread of going to my mother's funeral. I did not wish to see her dead. I then visualized my mother's face before me with her eyes closed. It was very vivid.
