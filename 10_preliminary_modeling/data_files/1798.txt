I am packing to go home. My mother and Paulina are helping. I am surprised there is so much stuff. I didn't come with this much. They had packed two empty suitcases in one of my boxes. I say, "We can take those out." My mother disagrees. She says, "I'll need them when I go to the bank." I say, "No, I won't." I feel angry. Then I see a box with all the family violins in it. I can't play my own, much less theirs. I take them anyway. Then they take a video picture of me playing a violin. It is pretty. My small daughter has a baby violin and is trying to learn to play. She breaks a string and it sounds terrible. I am glad they made this video for me. Then I go around, checking if we'd left anything behind. I see lots of papers I don't need and the hot pink sexy dress Lydia gave me. I think, "Well, it'll be here if I need it." We leave.
