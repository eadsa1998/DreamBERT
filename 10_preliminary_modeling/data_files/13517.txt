I was at school and it was Year 12. We got our timetable but it was confusing. Samantha, Calvin and I were in this room. My bag was small and had orange on it. My first class was in C3, but there were lots of C3's. People were following me to the class, but we finally found it. Eugene was there but he was in the class next door. Our class had to look after Mandy Moore. The teachers were really outgoing and treated us like kids and I knew that I was going to hate this class. Eventually, Mandy came in and the teacher was saying stuff and we had to repeat what he said. The teacher kept calling her Audrey. She went to her room and we were downstairs. This lady blew a party thing in my face and asked what was wrong. We were all standing in this line and Evelyn was in front of me. I moved a chair and left the line. Once everyone left, I got my bag and left. I realized it was a dream so I said "No-one can see me". I got to the front office and asked the lady how to read the timetable. She said something and then "now you wanna get out of a draft". I made her forget everything. This other lady had this alien thing. I gave her this "love yourself" card. She gave me a thank you one. Someone came in and I made him walk off. It was Carson and I was glad it wasn't Eugene.
