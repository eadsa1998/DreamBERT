We are in the jungle on patrol. I am speaking with Ray, RTO for the Command Platoon. In the dream he is youthful and trim, though his features are gaunt, hollowed out, wearied by fear and fatigue. The vivid terrain resembles Song Be, though the scrub and bush are sparse, providing less cover. Fear and dark foreboding are paramount in Ray's eyes. Recollection ends here.
