Well, the first part I remember, we had to do this weird thing. This guy put a board across this big muddy spot and we had to go down it. But then when we got there, there was nowhere to go. When I looked to my LEFT I saw the inside of my house. I don't remember what was on the right. When I got up from the spot I was in, I walked into the big room and Courtlyn asked me if I wanted to have the other shirt and shorts that Holly gave her. See, Holly gave her two matching shirts and shorts for two of us to wear to the Valentine's Day dance. Setting: The dream took place mainly in this big room. I don't know, it might have been in my house. Characters: The weird guy with the board I didn't know. Courtlyn is my good friend, and Holly is a 7th grader at my school. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, angry, confused. Well, when I went down the board and saw the inside of my house, I was confused and a little angry at the guy. Other than that I was happy.
