["Joining the top comedians team."] I am in a room. I think it is Susie who is running a performance. She has the top comedians who do improvisation work on stage. Alan King, Robin Williams, and some others. I watch and then she invites me to try. I imitate them and draw the attention of the audience away from them. They are surprised and a friendly competition arises. They'd upstage me. This upset Susie. She says Darn it, they are taking all the attention to the front of the stage. Then I'd work harder and be so good that the audience would look at me. Then I see out the living room window that Jake has arrived in a junky car. (looks like Ellie's car.0 He walks right into the middle of the performance and chats about how he has some of our aunt's scatter rugs he's returning to her. The audience is getting restless. The show sort of dissipates.
