My dream was about my family and I and my boyfriend. As I was sleeping I fell into this dream where my boyfriend was driving me home. We were older and he got out of the car and went in my house. Then I see all of my family coming out of the house and they were bleeding and then they died. He came to me and cut my stomach twice (deep). Then we drove away. I never bled and died, but I never healed either. I was like that for the rest of my life. As I was having this dream and sleeping, I felt pain in my stomach. I felt like it was really happening to me as I slept. I woke up and still felt the pain.
