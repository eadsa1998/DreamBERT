Something interesting is happening and a crowd of people have gathered in a circle. I drive my wheelchair around trying to find a place where I can get in to see. A man pauses and gestures that he's holding a place for me. I smile and say no and go on, realizing after I said no that that's what I wanted. Then I find a hole and another woman and I get in to see. Then I leave, now I'm walking and leaving the group. I am going to my car. A young man leans into the window of my car and starts talking. His name is John. He suggests we go for a drive. He gets in and drives. We're out on a country road talking and I'm aware he's looking for a place to park so we can kiss. I wonder why I'm there. He pulls over and scoots over and kisses me. It is gentle and tender. I turn away and say no, and push him away. He persists. I feel his need and love. I say, "You're a student at the community college and a young man. I'm an old woman. NO." He still wants me. Then I tell him to get out. He draws a map so I can find my way back. I get in the driver's seat and the car slides down a narrow, bumpy, dirt trail that has masses of blueprints and office papers all over the road. I manage to drive over it, wondering if my car can handle it.
