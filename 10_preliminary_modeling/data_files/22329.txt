I dreamed I was in the second storey of a house, but it looked like the roof of a church. Then the earth began to shake and the roof started to crack. My father and my mother didn't move. Then I left the house and the people were running through the streets; they were afraid. Then I found myself in the apartment, at the door of the house of a homosexual who tells the girls' fortunes through cards. He told me my fortune and then I asked him if I should make the sign of the cross and he said yes, and then I awoke.
