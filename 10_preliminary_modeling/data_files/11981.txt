I was at some spooky place. People were coming back to life as zombies. I can't remember properly but Dad, Mom, Ezra and I and a few other people were the only live people left. We were wandering around looking for food and I ended up in a Thai restaurant. I went in and got some spaghetti in a bowl. I ate some but an evil person came and I hid under the table but he saw me. I 'paused' the game and he couldn't see me, but he stayed waiting and it wasn't actually a game. Anyway, somehow I got out and met up with Mom and company. We got to the gate and got out of the city. Then I said what if the gate was closed to keep them in. Then we heard them coming and we went to Nana's.
