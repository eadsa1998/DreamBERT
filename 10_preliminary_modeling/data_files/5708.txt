[1997-05-18] Dreamed I was in my computer room in the basement, trying to write a letter, to my friend H, trying to decide whether to put it in Braille or on tape. Then was sitting in front of the window, opening the curtains to feel how warm the sun was then turned back to the computer and could hear opera music from a radio station coming through the computer speaker.
