I was at a movie theater and kept missing the movies. Somehow, I got separated from my parents and Charles (my history teacher) was chasing me and Zena. We ended up in one room at My school, where a party was going on. I knew that Charles was in there too, and we couldn't escape him and he couldn't escape us. My parents were there too, and so was Courtlyn's dad, but not Courtlyn. Charles had a power to change into other people, not change change, but good makeup change. My brother was there too. Zena and I tried to find out who he was, and my dad helped too. We were sure he was this robot walking around, but we dismantled it and he wasn't in there. The dream ended when Zena and I and my dad were trying to figure out if Charles was this mean man there. Setting: Dark, lurkey places, and one room that I can't remember at My school. Characters: Charles, my history teacher that I don't really like. Zena, my friend. Doesn't like Charles either. Courtlyn's dad - nice guy, playing with Adam. Dad - just Dad. Likes to help. Mom, Adam - like games, were just there doing nothing. Lots of other people I don't know. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, worried, protected. It was weird and scary. I hope Charles wouldn't be that mean!
