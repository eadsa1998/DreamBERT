 I'm working at Grocery Getto again. Inventory is being taken upstairs by the office. I'm sorting baseball cards, soap, and gum. My sunglasses are on a shelf in the manager's office. I'm cleaning the break room. There is a woman who may be my friend Persia Miko's roommate, Amie. Another girl comes in, angry that her cheese and crackers aren't there. She asks if I know where they are. I say no. I'm wiping tables. A kid comes up and wants me to work for him while he goes on break. I already am. Another kid tells me to "get to work". I stand on a chair and get my sunglasses off the top shelf. The Manager and assistant manager come in as I am going out. They look busy. I don't have a hat or mittens. The cart room is empty. <br/
