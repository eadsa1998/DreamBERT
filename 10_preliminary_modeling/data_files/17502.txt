In the back seat of the car with our friends Jake and Celia in the front and my boyfriend Jeremy in back with me, we stopped at the church parking lot, and all fell asleep.  When we woke up, the three of them all vomited.  In a grand stadium, I went to the bathroom.  On my way back, I saw my former friend Jenna.  Didn't expect to, because she's not friends with Jake and Celia.  She was somewhat friendly.  I went back and sat down with Jeremy.  It was Jake and Celia's wedding.  Jeremy was the best man, and went down to the 'stage' with them in a tuxedo.  It was rather like a musical, and for a time I was watching from down there as well.  I was very happy for them and wondered how things would change.  I was also slightly jealous.  Afterwards, I saw the ring.  It looked like it was made from cinnamon- not shiny at all.  She wore it on her middle finger.
