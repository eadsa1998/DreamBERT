We were in the open country. It seemed to me that a bull was to charge us. We made preparations and when we were charged, I took care of the situation. I was the victor. I was working for Mike Anthony. I was forcing oil into a container. It was going so slow, so Mike made a hole in another place and the can spout broke and the oil poured in freely. I could see it go thru both holes. I looked at a switch that opened the garage doors. S____ was working with us. He went into another room and was lying on a bench sleeping. We woke him up and said he couldn't sleep. I heard a fellow say, "I'm playing Stept. He's a winner."
