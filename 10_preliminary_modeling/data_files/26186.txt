 The Minnesota Vikings and the Green Bay Packers are playing football. The score is tied at zero. It is a very defensive game. My friends Gino Teavor, Bubba Hacker, and I are playing on the offense. Our defensive team is doing a great job. Our team missed a field goal in the first half, and there have been no other scoring attempts. My sister Heather and my high school crush Harmony Allure are there for lunch, which seems to be near the alley at home, at the bottom of the hill. People are having burgers from The Greasepit for lunch.
