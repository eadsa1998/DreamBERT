I'm babysitting on Halloween night. Five beautiful girls come in. One is dressed up as a pumpkin, another as a little girl, and another as a little boy. The fourth one is dressed up as the man in a Marlboro ad, and the fifth is dressed up as a clown. Their costumes are very well put together. We sit around and talk about this and that, when three or four of my friends come in. We all decide to go off somewhere. But I can't go because I'm babysitting.
