Something was going on in the mobile home park across the street.  There was a man who looked like Jack, an Indian man I chat with online.  He had a gun, and whatever he was up to, his intentions were trouble.  My parents and brother Stuart and I ran to see what was going on.  In running we encountered a woman with a gun, and we told her not to let the man take it.  In a cluttered room, the man takes her in a struggle.  My family and I stood off to the side, helpless.  My dad had a large knife, and he was scared.  The fear cracked him.  He made only one motion of the knife in their direction.  Before I knew what happened, he took the knife to my left forearm.  He struck my mother and I struggled as he turned back toward me.  He was stronger, and sliced me again.  He was trying to kill us so we wouldn't die at the hands of the other man.  When I awoke I felt the pains of the cut on my arm.
