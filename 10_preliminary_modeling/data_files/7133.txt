I was visiting friends. They were going to put on a show. Stat was drawing a plan of the grounds. "There's a tree there," said her mother. As Stat finished, I said, "You are quite an artist, but where is it? That's not your court." There were purple violets in her plan. "No, it is ___ school," she said. I ask, "When are we to go?" "At a quarter to six?" "But it is 6:05 now." "No, just six." "No, 6:05." So I start to dress, going to the bathroom and locking the door. Just as I was about to use the toilet, I see the door open and Stat about to enter. Tell her to come on in; it is all right for us both. Start to get dress to wear but as I reach for russett dress, the others tumble on the floor. Stat starts out door with a baby in her arms. I ask George if Alma has gone already. He tells me that she is in the hospital with pneumonia.
