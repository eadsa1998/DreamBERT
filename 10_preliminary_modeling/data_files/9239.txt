I was vacuuming my dining room. I wasn't going to move the table and chairs, but just vacuuming around them. I stopped to work on my plants. My plant stand was against the same wall as the wardrobe. I was pulling the dead leaves off. Every shelf was full of plants. Some of the plants had large clumps of dead branches and leaves. It seemed that the more I pulled off the more I found. The table and chairs have been moved out of the dining room. I realized that I had let the plants go so long that there were weeds growing out of the carpet next to the baseboard. I was trying to pull them all out but having trouble with some of them. I had a garbage bag sitting against the opposite wall that was half-full. I started pulling all of the debris in that bag and filled it up. I got out another trash bag and started filling it. I realized I was going to have four bags of trash to take out to the dumpster.
