Mary and I are embracing and kissing each other. We know she is dying. We are waiting for some kind of information, but I don't know what kind. Mary opens a package in her hand. It contains sanitary napkins. She is relieved that it is the brand she prefers, and not another brand. I have a good look at Mary. Her hair is long, black and glossy, as it had been when both of us were younger. I feel her body and experience the thrill of hugging her. I hear her tell me that she loves me and I tell her how much I love her.
