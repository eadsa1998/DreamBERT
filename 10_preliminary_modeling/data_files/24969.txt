 I'm driving my truck down Home Avenue in Oak Valley, going south. I just started it, and it's running rough. It stalls by Roman's house and I coast down to 1st Street, turn left, and restart it. I turn left on Next Avenue and go north. I turn into Robbins' driveway. There are two parts to a dock there. I go up to the garage, but lose my footing on the clutch and brake and hit it. Then I say that I'm going to do that over, and I do, stopping before I hit the garage. There are other people there. One person is eating an orange. Something about recycling is going on. Kent Robbins is in the garage. I am Fred Flintstone. Something happens with a bicycle.
