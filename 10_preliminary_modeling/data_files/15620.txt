I checked my email and I had to schedule an induction for a stocktaking job. I was on the phone and there was an entry fee of $500. There was a boot camp with pictures of an island place. I still had to do my exam and it was a few hours before my induction. I watched a movie and then had to leave because it was getting late. For the induction I had to weird stuff, eg write down 5 things we want to do (I wrote down 5 movies including The Adjuster and Foolish Wives). We had to take 5 things out of our bag to show our personality; I had magazines, movies and a puzzle book. This guy said I had no personality. Then my bag had different things in it and I was confused and everyone was like 'that's what you came in with' and I said it wasn't. I said "don't pull this Matrix stuff on me". There was a broken thing and I grabbed food out of it and threw it at the wall. They came to stop me. Then I was back home, but something was not right and I realised it and it was another trick.
