I see Dr. Feingold (analyst from C. City). I am late for my appointment. I apologize and feel guilty. See Dr. Smith (my analyst from B. City). He is going upstairs with another patient. He tells me that he cannot see me any more. I ask, "Where can I reach you?" He gives me his Inverness address and continues walking upstairs, wearing a hat. At the top of the stairs he turns and says: "Really Emma, if you must, you can write me!" Shift: I see Denise (girl friend from Vienna). She is living in a sumptuous house by the sea. We talk of living two lives. At another moment we are children the age of Marita. We are happy together.
