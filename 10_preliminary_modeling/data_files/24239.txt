I was on a road trip, and stopped off at a Wal-Mart, with an RV-tailgate area in the parking lot. I was with a few friends... but we were really like bounty hunters or soldiers of fortune. It was an island kind of like the one in the video game Halo 1 ... long story short, I was inside the store, and people started shooting. I took that as a cue to use the diversion as an advantage. I went in and grabbed as many guns as possible. I looked for the flashy ones, the big ones and the expensive ones. Magnum revolvers. Old, big pistols. Cross-bow conversions. Long-range rifles. We had small arms in the Winnebago. I later went on the run, being chased and hiding in a canal. It was filled with algae. I climbed a fence. I came out later on a golf course and was running from a helicopter that had an easy time spotting me in the open.
