Something about the CAS training manual. Now we are in a facility that had several women's restrooms. They each had several stalls. All of them were out of toilet paper. All of the other women seem to somehow be making do without. But I was unwilling to do that. I knew where they stored the toilet paper so I went and got a roll. At the time I didn't know that all of the stalls were out. I had went into one that was out previously. When I came back and went into another it was out also. I went to the storage room and got another roll and took it back with me. As I was using the toilet I heard a woman in another stall say something about being out of toilet paper and another woman told her she just had to make due. I said, No you don't. I can tell you where they store it.
