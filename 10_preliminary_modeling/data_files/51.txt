I am a superhero with a costume, cape, and everything, except I'm not terrific at it - the costume is light-colored and not flashy - I don't fly but I do swing from a rope. I'm with someone - not rescuing him but we're about some business, and I'm swinging us from one spot to a rooftop - not high but quite slanted. Red tile. Another man is there already, he had a task of his own and we're joining him - we sort of all crash together and it's an awkward picture of us all trying to get our footing on the roof at one time. I don't know why I know it's me, since the caped crusader is a man, but I'm pretty sure. Scenery's nice - old-world village, sort of.
