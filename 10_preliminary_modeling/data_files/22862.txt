I am down the highway from a sort of drive-in restaurant or donut shop facing the highway.  A car stops in front of it and two men wearing black leather jackets get out.  I am suspicious, and sure enough, one shoves a gun in the window of the place.  I go around to the back and am going to call the police if I can find a phone.  A man comes around there and gives me a gun and says to keep them there until he gets the police.  To show me how to use it, he fires two of the three shots left.  I go around to the front, and they are just getting into their car, a brown and yellow 1957 Ford.  I talk to them a while and tell them not to leave.  Someone I know is in the car with them-not as a hostage, I don't believe.  The driver has a gun too, but I have the drop on him.  They say they are going to leave, so I take the barrel and swing it at the windshield, but the windshield doesn't break.  They pull away, and I forget to get their license number.  I go back to the restaurant, and a man is in front of it on the ground-shot, but not dead.
