I am in a room and a huge monarch butterfly is flying around. I think it is beautiful. It lands on my right wrist. I am excited, but a little nervous as it is a live insect and so big. At first it is interesting, but I get more nervous as it wriggles around and around and wraps itself around my wrist like it is spinning a cocoon. I see several crawly bugs, like its larva, and I get a bit panicky and want it off before this gets out of control. I don't want to touch it myself and run into another room where "Benny" is lying on the floor with an injured, bloody leg, perhaps shot or broken. Next to him is Burt Lancaster, who I ask to remove the butterfly. I caution him to be careful and not hurt the creature. He is rough and rips it from my wrist. It is torn and crumpled. He plops it on a table. I feel relieved it is off me and sad it is hurt.
