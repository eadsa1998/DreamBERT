I with 2 or 3 others are looking for my lost golf ball. The immediate vicinity is of very uneven topography, and one of the searchers suggest that the ball may .... large ditch. This, however, seems very unlikely, as the caddie had a good line on the ball -- the line being obtained by sighting along 2 trees, one large and one small -- and according to this the ball should be about where we are looking. As we kick around through the grass and stones we find old golf balls by the scores, nearly all of them lopsided, badly cut, or without covers and not worth keeping. Chester does find 2 or brand new ones, and I decide to pocket a few to knock off into the woods. One short steep slope is thickly studded with a combination of golf balls and round white stones which can scarcely be told from golf balls until one gets down on his hands and knees and examines them intently. Finally I drop another ball which trickles over a small rise, and then starts rapidly rolling down a long hill. Faster and faster it goes but, when nearly out of sight, it suddenly plops into a hole which seems to be full of something black, perhaps mud. I carefully mark the hole.
