I'm Cary Grant's wife and we are in a comedy 1930's movie. He wants to buy a lottery ticket and I ask how much and he says, "1,000 dollars and a tuppance." I am indignant. "A tuppance?" I say, "That's too much to ask! A tuppance, indeed." He does his comedic "Hum" double take and then points to the line of people waiting to buy tickets. A young woman announces her mother works at a bank at the other end of the mall. I think, "What clever foreshadowing because he'll want to borrow money later in the plot and it's all set up where and how." He then suggests to me that we offer to pay off the other people and then we'll get the winning ticket and be rich. I smile indulgently like a good movie actress wife. He does this and all the people scurry off to collect. He turns to me and says, "Uh oh, I don't have 8 thousand dollars to pay them with. Maybe they'll forget and go home." We are going toward them. One man tries to get around Cary, and Cary says, "Tsk Tsk. Now I won't tell you where the elephant is." The man goes quickly by as Cary comedically watches from the turn style (the long way). He says, "Will you look at that? He went around the elephant. Hum!" The elephant is a shortcut path to the lines. We get to the lines and I see Cary's other wife in the other line.
