I dreamed that apparently it was my mother-in-law had some relatives come down to stay at the big house next door. There were quite a few of them altogether. We were all over there at the large house eating. One of the girls got something in her eye. One of the older men took it out with a handkerchief. Then they asked me what I thought of that for doctoring. I said, "Fine, as long as you use a clean handkerchief." Then one of them was using a tractor towing, it was a large tractor towing a small grass cutter at the end of a long rope to cut the grass. As he made his turn, I noticed that the line had gotten tangled up, but someone ran out and straightened it when he started pulling the lawn mower again. Some of the kids were playing in the far back of the house, and there seemed to be an excess of water back there. It was like grounds under water. That's about it. Hall: He didn't recognize who the girl and man were, but he thinks they were relatives. There were not only his wife's relatives, but his family was over to this big house. The man who was driving the tractor and the lawn mower was known to Sam. He's a physician here in town. That's wrong. This M.D. is a relative of Sam's wife. Sam doesn't remember if any of his family was there, just his wife's family. The kids that were playing out in the yard were some of her relatives too.
