 I'm going swimming with others at something like the YMCA. I leave my house and realize I've forgotten a pair of shorts to wear as swimming trunks, other than the ones I'm wearing. I have on my red and black-checkered shorts, and decide they'll suffice. I walk into the swimming pool area and around the pool. My grade school classmate Sonya Nittles is in the pool. I'm naked. I'm somewhat embarrassed, but not very much. A dozen other people are in the pool. I go into the locker room and start looking for a small locker to put my belonging into. There is a boy who steals easily from soda vending machines by sticking his skinny arm up into the machine. I bump into a locker, which opens inward. The locker is like a toilet stall, and there is man in it defecating. I look in a vending machine and grab some candy that is left in the bottom of it. I try to find a locker that I think my stuff will be safe in: I don't have a lock. There are many lockers available, but I want one that is secluded so it's not likely it will be bothered.
