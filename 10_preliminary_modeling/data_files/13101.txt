I was watching Doctor Who, but then it was Firefly. There was a castle thing and it had these smoke clouds. I was telling someone that this was like another episode of their show. I don't remember it properly, but Wash and Book were caught. Zoe wasn't happy. I remember Mal, Kaylee, Simon and Jayne were around too. The creatures were gargoyle like.
