My dream takes place in the basement of what appears to be my former high school (G). I remember that it is quite dark in the basement and I was alone. I approached a stairway leading from the basement outside and see the outline of a tall, heavily built man, his back to me, bolting the door. I cannot remember seeing his face. Be turned around and I screamed for help. There was a leather couch down in the basement, exactly like the one found in the MA lounge. I can't remember details, but I got the impression that he attacked me. The next thing I remember is being outside, crying, and seeing my boyfriend. I rush toward him and bury my head in his shoulder. A policeman appears on the scene and at the same time my attacker. My boyfriend points the man out to the policeman, who takes him away.
