Autumn joined the MUPC. We were in human biology together. People were complaining about Ms Edmundson being a bad teacher. I was talking to Autumn as we were leaving and I asked how she got here and she came on this huge truck thing with like a water tank and wheels like a tank. It would suck stuff closer to it. I said that I took the bus, but she offered to drive me back. I was unsure about the truck, but agreed anyway. I text Mom to say I was getting a ride. We also discussed failing last year.
