I was riding down a tower's stairs on my bike and we were about three stories high. A friend of mine wanted to bust me up by throwing my bike over the side. I told him that if he tried, I would beat the hell out of him. All of a sudden he threw my bike over. So I hit him so hard he fell over the edge. He fell about three stories. When I looked over the edge he was dead. I walked down to see if were really alive or dead. Then I saw my brother-in-law walk by. I called for help but he would not come over to help. When I looked at my friend he was alive again as if he were waking up from a sleep.
