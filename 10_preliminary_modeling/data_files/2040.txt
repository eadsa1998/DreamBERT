I am seated next to a young man who is a beginning practicing Ninja warrior. He's doing an intricate knife dance where it looks like he has four hands he uses to spread the fans or fabric out smoothly with intricate hand movements. At one point, he starts to move his foot to help out, but stops and looks at me to see if I saw. A real Ninja wouldn't have been that amateurish or clumsy. I smile as I watch. This other guy and I (like kids) suggest we all go practice and play Ninja. He hands me a knife and I swish it around. Now the visiting team shows up. I go out into the hall to get a drink of water and see, at the end of the hall, the room where we will have the competition. I go in. There is water and towels. After some ritual movement, I wipe up with the towel. The Ninja seems quite secretive and happy. He keeps saying, "Good, now we'll soon know. We've got samples now. We'll examine them and then you'll get your own flag (ship?)." He leaves, muttering to himself, "I know how we'll get it in, but I don't know how we'll get it out." The feeling is this is really an alien and he's going to renovate me (my body) in someway. I feel honored and a little scared. I pass a guy (like Coach) in the hall and say, "They said I get my own knife." "Good for you," he says as he walks by into his office. "And my own flag," I finish at the closed door. There is a pause and then he opens the door, grinning to me in wonderment. He sits down, inviting me to come in and tell him all about this extraordinary honor. He's at a loss to understand how or why I've been so honored. I start coughing and feel a spasm in my throat coming on. [I wake up coughing like a near spasm had occurred.]
