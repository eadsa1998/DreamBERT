I'm observing an operation, but I'm not standing in the room or even outside the room looking in. The surgical team is getting ready to operate on this woman. They haven't started yet because they have a number of concerns what seems to be at least one question that is very important that it be answered before they do anything. The question has something to do with something that she ate or may have eaten. They were concerned that it may have had a Koa Nut in it and if so the surgery would be much more dangerous and/or they would have to proceed differently, or maybe not at all. They were discussing the case. If she had eaten a Koa Nut, do they do anything with that? Do they need to? If so, what? Someone said something about a cereal that she eats on a regular basis, which has raisins and something else in it, maybe some kind of grain. This makes them realize that it does not have any nuts in it. Now they're confident that she has not eaten a Koa Nut. Now they know that it's okay to go ahead with the surgery. They are operating on her and they decide that the problem is a bad kidney so they removed her kidney. Then they also discovered that she had a double-hernia and so they removed that. A woman on the surgical team held up this very large organ, using a pair of surgical tongs, and said, it might have been this double hernia. It was oval in shape and about the size of a football.
