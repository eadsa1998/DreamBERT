I was in my bedroom watching TV. I was with friends who always watch TV with me. At that moment they were showing the Peru-Germany game. I screamed, saying the names of the Peruvian team players so that they would make a goal. On another side Mary was praying to God, Dora was crying from nervousness, Ruth was laughing from nervousness. At last Peru made a goal and we all started to jump with joy because Peru was world champion. Later on we were in a carnival in the street, celebrating the victory of Peru, because they were bringing home the world cup. There was joyful noise everywhere, and then they knocked at my door to wake me up and my dream ended.
