["Helping the sick man."] I am a nurse in a Doctor's office. I open the door to the waiting room and call out next. I look down at my feet to see many report covers with files in them (like on my plays). The male patient is hiding behind the plant next to the door. I say wow. You sure have a long medical history. Come on in. He comes in. He is in great pain. He is frustrated with the medical system. I try and make him feel comfortable. I pull out three glass tubes for blood tests. One with rose colored top, another yellow and a third soft green. I look to him to confirm I've guessed the right types of tests. He nods. I pour some sticky rose colored substance into one tube. I then help him into the exam room. His leg muscles cramp up as I lay him down. He writes in pain. I massage his leg muscles that are all knotted up. It would relax and then knot up again. I sooth him as I work by talking gently.
