 I walk into a piano recital late with another person. My friend Stephen Ramos is playing the recital. We walk up the side stairway and sit there until he is done playing. I think my mom is there, and she plays something too. I am wearing my fuzzy winter jacket. I sit in a loft-like section with my jacket half zipped and my hands deep in my pockets.
