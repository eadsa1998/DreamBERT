["Not prepared."] I am waiting for the beginning of a concert I will attend. Dwight is with me. I see Ginny and her father in law arrive. I call out to them. Then don't hear and go into the auditorium. I am waiting out in the stairwell, hall. Suddenly I remember that at 7:30, the same time the concert starts, I am supposed to be giving a warm up speech on Assertiveness before the main guest speaker arrives. I remember I left the notes at home. I have 10 minutes and that's not enough time to make it home. I am frantic. I race into the speech room and ask for a spare copy of the syllabus. I find some notes and books on a shelf out in the hall and frantically try to find the ones for this speech. I throw the papers around and some slide onto the floor. I ask Dwight to pick them up for me so people won't slip on them. He says no, he doesn't want to. I am annoyed with him for not being helpful. I am agitated and upset, panicking because I can't remember what I was to talk on. I am already formulating what I could speak on. I'll make it, but I hate this rushed unprepared feeling. I wake up in an alert agitated state.
