I am traveling. I go to Germany. Cousin Abner is there. They are friendly. I sit in an old overstuffed chair that sort of dumps you to the floor. It's a room for old ladies. Then Dovre and I catch a bus. I can't find the ticket booth, so the driver shows me. I walk up a steep hill. The bus then takes us to Paris, France. We then walk up another steep hill to see the beautiful idyllic country scenery. We walk through a cafe and I remember I don't know how to speak French. A woman suggests I speak German. I remember I can speak Spanish. I say, "Comer!" Later on the hill at sun rise I am delighted with the view and at my camera ready. As I prepare to take a picture, I notice lots of people, tourists, in the way. I have waited too long.
