At almost dark on a Sunday night, from the narrow walkway behind the church, I see Sharon walking toward Oak Park on the sidewalk just on the other side of the doctor's office.  I feel like I haven't seen her in a long time.  I rush across the lot toward her and meet her under a tree by the sidewalk, but my belt has been working loose and my pants have fallen down.
