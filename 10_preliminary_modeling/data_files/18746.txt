We were on a flat raft going down a river. On the banks were natives of the land--some in primitive dress--some in safari dress. It was in a hot tropical place--like a Tarzan set. At the same time it was happening it was also a TV show. I wasn't sure what was real. I hadn't seen the TV show. There were 3 of us and a nun on the raft. I said, "I've never seen this before!" and Dora said, "You haven't seen this show? It's 'Nick Davis.' It's the best show ever. At that point the main character said, "My name is Nick, Nick ______________________" and I shouted something that rhymed with Davis, Dora shouted something that rhymed with Davis--the nun knew these weren't the right answer. So she shouted, "DAVIS." Right then a native on the bank shot her in the head. She was dead. She fell over stiff on the raft and ended up face down in the water. This was the plot of the show every week--the one who said his name right got shot. After she was shot, Nick Davis said, "Whew, I thought I was gonna have to say my own name." He knew what was going on. It didn't seem to bother him at all. I was working on a computer, knee-deep---waist-deep in water. The screen would reverse--the file disappear. I was frustrated. My coat was slung over the back of the chair in the water--soaking wet. A little girl, teenager in the water said she didn't like southern girls. They were all 5'7". Dora was next to me. She was 5'7" and her hair was wet. The girl said southern girls didn't have sex but used glass penises with babies inside. I said I'd never heard that. I told her I was from South Carolina. She said she lived in North Carolina growing up. I said, "That must've been hard--they don't like Yankees," and she said, "Yeah," A skunk was in front of the farm house. Rudy threw a white bucket high in the air, hoping it would land on the skunk, but it didn't. Then we were watching the skunk--he'd put on overalls, walking upright. We tried to figure out if he was mad enough to spray. Corinne's 30 X 40" prints were spread out on the floor with quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies piled in the center to weigh them down. I took showers at the gallery. I had a beautiful green towel dress. 3 phones rang. Carlos came in.
