This dream also dealt with the experimental situation, but is much more difficult to recall. There was something about being downstairs in the basement or cellar of this house and then eventually leaving to go outside and go upstairs. At one point there was conversation between a small number of people about the EEG record and what it meant, and among their speculations was whether it was being influenced by some disturbance going on in the top story or upper part of the house. About the only element that I can recall very distinctly was going outside of their basement room and turning the corner to then go upstairs.
