I had been eating in the restaurant and wanted to go to a psychology meeting. It was in an educational building but I hadn't been on the campus for so long that I didn't remember where that was. "Was it off that way", I pointed diagonally. He said yes after my second question. Then I looked through a window and saw the brick wall of a building wing. (like at Iowa) I was in and then in front of a yellow brick building on which I could almost make out, EDUCATIONAL. So I went over into a large hall with step seats. Two men were arranging seats, etc. I asked if the psychology group was to meet there. No reply. I look again at the notice, "308, that's up one more floor, isn't it?" "Yes." So I leave but go downstairs instead. Notice I'm going wrong and start to climb up.
