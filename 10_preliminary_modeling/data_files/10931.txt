I dreamt that I with my father was traveling on a train through a dark tunnel. We were sitting together, but I got up and moved to the back of the train. There was a Negro man of about 50 years sitting there, and I seemed to know him. The train slowed down and I said to the Negro, "Well, here we are." He got off the train and boarded a ferry boat.
