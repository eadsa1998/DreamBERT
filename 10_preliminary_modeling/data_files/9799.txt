Lily Lemnos (choir member and sister of Gary) is at our house: we have lots of new and old furniture Frank has dug up from somewhere; even on the lawn there is furniture. I try to re-arrange it all, as best I can; we are sitting or lying in the room; Lily L. comes in and lies down on a pillow and covers her head. (!) "Like a kitten," I say. We are about to watch TV, but instead just talk. Lily L. gets up and gets dressed up to go to the theater; she is going to Waiting for Godot - I talk to Marissa Camden.
