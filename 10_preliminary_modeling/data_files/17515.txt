I dreamt of talking to my father, but my brother Stuart came in and insisted on us watching a commercial, and recording it.  Fine, did so.  I was pissed at him.  The video was about Better than Baldness, or something, in a courtroom.  I was not impressed and threw the CD at him.  As I left he told me it was just the breath of God.  I said, "No, It's not." and walked off around the cars, looking for my boyfriend Jeremy.
