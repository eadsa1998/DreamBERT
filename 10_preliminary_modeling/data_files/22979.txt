Dick and Roxanna Trumpett and their friends Gary and Cynthia Archland were spending the night with us, in a house arranged like one I grew up in back in my hometown.  My wife Bonita and I and the Trumpetts were sleeping in our king-sized bed, in the front bedroom, while the Archlands were to sleep in the back bedroom, on something like a sofa bed.  I don't know how the arrangements came about, but I felt a bit guilty about letting the Archlands sleep back there on a less comfortable bed, since they were our guests.  It didn't make me feel bad enough to offer to trade with them, though.  I thought it would be too obviously an afterthought-and besides, I liked the idea of sharing a bed with Roxanna.  She and Dick went to tell the Archlands goodnight.  Then they came back and got in bed with us.  Dick kissed Bonita goodnight, and I kissed Roxanna.  Bonita's kiss was a simple goodnight kiss, but when I kissed Roxanna, she opened her mouth, I opened mine, and we drank each other deeply inside.  At that point, I was really looking forward to the night.  The only thing to hamper my enjoyment of the kiss, and my anticipation, was wondering what Bonita would think.
