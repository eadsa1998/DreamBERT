This is pretty much a jumble, and I don't remember the order.  In one part I was cutting through the pavement of a plaza in front of a church.  I don't remember why.  I had permission from someone to do it, but I'm not sure it was someone in position of authority, so I was still a little afraid of getting caught.  The saw had a very short blade, and it was clearly going to take some time, especially since I had to cut through from one side to the other in about three different directions.  It cut surprising easily, though.  At one point I saw some clothing in the hollow beneath the pavement that I cut open.  I recognized them as belonging to my wife Anita and me.  I cut a hole and thought about making it big enough to put my fist through and retrieve them, but then I realized that it was clothing we had gotten rid of, so didn't see the point in getting it back.
