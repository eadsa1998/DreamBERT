["Merle's Table."] I am helping Merle clean up a very large beautiful wooden table. It has a plate glass slab on the top of it. The matching chairs are very ornate and carved. I am washing off the encrusted smudges. It is hard work and I feel the tiredness in my arms. But it feels good to be working. Then there are scattered piles of papers, magazines and books. I ask him what I should do with the newspapers. He says make a pile of newspapers. I see a Life magazine. He says make a pile of magazines. I organize and clean. It feels good. There are two tables very much alike.
