[We got engaged 8-17-95.]  Dream:  Jeff and I had our wedding.  About a half-hour before the wedding, I was trying to decide whether to wear the white wedding dress Jeff's mom gave me, or the flowered dress I bought in New Mexico this spring.  My middle sister brought me baby's breath to put in my hair.  I remembered Jeff would be wearing his new blue suit and flowered tie, so I decided to wear the white wedding dress, to be as formal as possible.  I went to the wedding.  It was so beautiful.  Not many more details, but a general feeling of fulfillment, beauty, and hope for our wonderful life together.  I was so glad I get to be with Jeff.  It seemed we were near the coast in California at the wedding.  There was a pier or board walkway nearby, near the ocean.  Later in the dream, Jeff and I had a baby girl.  We played with her as she crawled around, and both picked her up and held her. I held her close to my chest and loved her.  I was so glad Jeff and I had this pretty baby girl.  Later in the dream, I was on an airplane flying.  I was changing clothes in my seat or fixing my dress, trying to get my bra straight.
