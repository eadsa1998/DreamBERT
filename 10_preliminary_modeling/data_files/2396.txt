I'm walking across a field and see a muddy water puddle and realize I can choose to go around it. I do, but then I see the entire field and streets are covered with water, so I slosh through it down the road. I come to a brick fence and stop; looking over I see the ocean with lots of industrial things all over. I feel tired and sad because the whole world is ugly and takes over with industry. Then a fog comes up and I see a big seagoing ship with people on it going by. Then I'm talking to a man; he's telling me now I'm going to die. He says, "You'll get between a man and his wife and 'bang' you'll be shot or stabbed." I ask if it will hurt to die. He says, "Yes, a little, but it will be worth it because you will feel sooo good going home." I then feel a longing to "go home" (to heaven, or whatever).
