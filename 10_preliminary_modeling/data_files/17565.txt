I talked to my mother online, but she was ignoring me as she was on the phone.  I went and sat in the car with my boyfriend Jeremy.  My former friend Jenna walked by, waved, and motioned to open the window.  We did so and she was surprisingly friendly and wanted contact information that apparently she didn't have.  I asked my mother how she convinced Jenna to be friends again- she said she told her I was leaving (because of field study).
