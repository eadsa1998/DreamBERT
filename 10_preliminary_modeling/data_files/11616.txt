I found myself walking up a ramp surrounded on all sides by both stands and booths similar to a raffle or country fair. As I walked up the gaily-colored avenue all other things seemed engulfed in a grey smog. As I walked forward the situation seemed to be familiar but yet I felt strangely afraid. At the close of the dream I felt very frustrated because I couldn't reach the end of the path.
