My band is playing for a private party in the Southwest section. We were taking a break when a drunk comes in and starts banging away on my drums. I didn't want him doing this because he might damage something. I went over and asked him to quit, but he won't, so I started throwing punches at him and so did he at me. I totaled him out! He had a broken jaw and nose. Some of his friends took him away and my band started playing again.
