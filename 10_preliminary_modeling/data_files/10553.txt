       We are all outdoors on a hot day; I sit in the sun in a sling chair, and then moue to the shade. RUTH is talking to some women; I go inside. Earl comes by and we look at a book of poems. Suddenly he is overcome with goose pimples and nearly faints. He is whisked off by orderlies to the hospital. I call RUTH very loud. (vivid) She realizes something is amiss, she rushes up to me and we drive to the hospital; E. is revived and comes back with us, OK.
