["Howard wants to own real estate with me."] I am sleeping sitting up on a couch. I am exhausted. Charla is up and wants me to get up. I can't seem to wake up. Howard sneaks in through the window. I am annoyed but too tired to do anything about it. Finally I get up. Howard says there is this great deal on buying a house. He thinks we could pool our money and buy it together. I glare and him and say "WE?" in a cold tone. He flushes bright red. I repeat the question. He gets the point and walks out reluctantly, angry and still red.
