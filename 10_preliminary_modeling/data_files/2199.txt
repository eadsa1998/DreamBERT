Four women are all dressed alike, in a yellow/gold satin dress with black lace. They are dance hall hostesses. I am one and walk down the stairs. Then I'm a kid and I'm in trouble with the other kids because I paid out tutors too much money. They say, "Didn't you know they already make over 90 cents an hour?" I'm a little embarrassed. I lay on a bed and see a black and white kitten chasing a mouse. "That's just a toy mouse, right?" I ask and see that it is. I am relieved and reach down and pet them and play with them. I tease, "You really are mousers! You little mouse, you." I say it like it's not really true they are mousers.
