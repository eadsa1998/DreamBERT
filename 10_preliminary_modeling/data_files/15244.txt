Dad and I had gone to this place a bit far away and a guy had given me a good haircut. He had asked us to take off our shoes. Then Mom and I went and he said 'no pants, shoes or shirts'. Mom started taking off her clothes and we saw some customers with clothes and I questioned it. He pushed us into some water and Mom pulled him in too. I was under a bit long and took a breath and choked. We got out. I had a boyfriend who looked like Bill (True Blood), but had a different name. I was thinking that a guy had attacked him. Now I was at 'home' and he passed out covered in blood. I called out to this guy to call an ambulance and when I looked back in the room, his face was completely bloody and he was dead. I went to the phone and dialed 911, then realised I was doing it wrong and got my mobile. I said I needed an ambulance and that my boyfriend had [whatever happened] and another guy had been involved. A girl there asked for me and she said her name was 'Rob's daughter' and told me Quincy was dead. Then she was there and in the room with me, as were Darren and another woman. She asked if she could tell her and I said yes and she told her and Darren at the same time. I went back to my boyfriend and waited for the ambulance. This family came. I said I had to go to the toilet, but it was open and the seat and wobbly and I couldn't go. I went back to Bill. I checked his pulse and temperature and noticed he was still alive. The girl from before came and she started saying all these weird things, then Bill woke up and was like 'you're fired' to me and the girl smiled. Then he pushed her out of the room and grabbed me and kissed me. He pushed me to the floor and we made out. Then I mentioned he was still covered in blood.
