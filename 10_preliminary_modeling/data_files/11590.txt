I appear to have been in the National Guard of Ohio. I was witnessing the trial of three of my best friends (in real life) who were convicted of some crime worthy of capital punishment. In the next scene my friends are all lined up before a large firing squad and are about to be executed. The officer in charge gives the commands, "Ready, aim -- " and just then I cry that some enemy has attacked Toledo and that all the guardsmen must hurry to its defense. The officer stops the execution and hurries off with his firing squad. I feel very much pleased at the clever ruse I have succeeded in and am just puzzling over a way to escape the area when I awake.
