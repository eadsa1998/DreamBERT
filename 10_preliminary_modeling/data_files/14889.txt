We went through a drive thru at a takeaway place. I saw a car behind us and Jamison was in it. I joked around with Ezra and Samantha. Jamison' boyfriend was called Bill. Samantha drew a picture at university saying 'you should be with Damon' -- she meant Calvin. I was like 'ew no'. I asked this lady behind a counter when we would get our offers for university. She checked on the computer and said I had only put down Veterinary Science. I realized it was 'Jessica Holden' and I said it wasn't me. There was an online poker game at 4pm (US) which meant like 4am here. Robin Williams was in it and was doing well but then we realized he didn't actually know how to play. Nana and Granny were over. Grey's Anatomy was on. Teddy was in a hospital bed and Meredith visited her. I read that Kim Raver was moving was to my state for 'social [something]' so she was only in 5 episodes but I figured that because of the move she was in more.
