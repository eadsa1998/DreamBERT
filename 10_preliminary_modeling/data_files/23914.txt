I was at work at Buck's Grill House, and the homemade ice cream flavor that night was:  dried fig, cherry, and parachute cord.  (!)  And I looked in the big bucket of ice cream that Tim had made, and there were actually small pieces of parachute cord in it (along with cherries and figs). Even in the dream I thought this was odd.
