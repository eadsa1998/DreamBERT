I was in the personality and adjustment psychology class and Dr. Hall was discussing the term papers. He then read one to the class. It was a bit humorous and illogical. Just as he finished reading I told Dr. Hall that my paper was much better and only got a C on it and then I asked him what grade the writer of the paper he read received. He told me A+. I became angry at his getting an A+ and me only a C.
