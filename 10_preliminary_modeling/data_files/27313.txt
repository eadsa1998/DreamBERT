I dreamed I was at a baseball game having a wonderful time yelling and eating peanuts. All at once a thought struck me that as long as I had a good time so did everyone else. So I tried harder and harder at having a good time. Then I felt rather silly for my attitude and started to laugh at myself. I woke up then laughing.
