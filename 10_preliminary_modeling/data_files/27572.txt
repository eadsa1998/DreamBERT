I was over in the M_____ building on the second floor. I went into see Mrs. L_____ about some personal matter of some sort. Her office is right next to Dr. E_____'s and he saw me as I breezed by. A few minutes later I came out of her office and he was still sitting by his desk and looking out the door. As I went down the hall I felt strangely glad that he had seen me for now he knew that I had some friends in the history department. I seemed to feel as though I were defying him for some reason or other.
