Carl Carty and I are sowing grass seed in my hometown. The space between front porch and walk (shaded by large maple trees) is bare. Apparently we intend to sow seed in garden also, which has been plowed. Carl stands on garden fence, and reaches over with a long "pike" to drop up some clods. He uncovers a large stone, flat in shape, and having numerous shiny specks in it. Later on we are examining a sort of a framework of 2 x 4s one side of which is covered by a thin sheet of red composition, which is just soft enough so that small flakes can be picked off with finger nails. I point out to Carl that grass seed won't grow on this composition but he shows me that the frame work is to be filled in with sod or dirt -- there are some remnants of sod still sticking to some spots.
