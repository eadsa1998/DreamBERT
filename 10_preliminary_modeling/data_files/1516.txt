My "grandparents," Katherine Hepburn and some guy, have been killing people they know and saving them in suitcases. They kill another couple and decide it's time to take all the suitcases to the dump. They do so. Some attendant keeps poking around and makes them nervous. They finally sneak the stuff into the dumpster and drive away.
