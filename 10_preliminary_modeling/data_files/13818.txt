We were playing sport at school, but it wasn't school. We were in this huge outside area which had two 'storeys'. The bottom part had a Jacuzzi thing and Geneva liked it. Mr Quinlan was supervising them. Fatima and I were sitting out, but we decided to join in. Mr Quinlan said "Fatima! Where's your team?" and she said we didn't have one, but he said he had clothes in his bag (put on his red shirt). I told him I didn't have my shirt and this lady said they had some. He was going to send us down, but he had sent a guy down earlier and he had got on a bus and gone back to school. The game was like minesweeper and you had to dig in areas and those without mines had stuff under them. There were little Pikachu's on the ground. Then I was at home and I was out the back. The tree started shaking and I looked at it and a heap of branches fell down onto the spa. I didn't get to close but then saw a gigantic frog on it. I ran inside and Grady was in the kitchen. I said "It's a giant frog!". There was an even bigger one out the front. Then a HUGE one was out the back. It was walking and it stepped over the house. I was worried about my car.
