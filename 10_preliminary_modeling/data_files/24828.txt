I was at My school and my friends told me that the guy I have a crush on was there. So I went outside to see him. He was there with some of his friends. They were in his car. They all got out when they saw me. He was leaning on the front driver's side door. He looked at me and said, "Look at my new car." It looked like a 'vette, but it wasn't. He had left his window open and a weird guy (a person I don't know) jumped through the window and tried to steal the car. But I jumped through the car window and landed in the front passenger's side. I tried to stop him but he kept going. Then I managed to take the keys. I turned around the car and and to the weird guy's home. Then I drove to my crushes house and parked the car. His front door was open so I went in. His house was lit with candles. I saw him sitting in a chair sleeping. Then I woke up. Setting: my hometown. (School, car, boy's house.) Characters: Andrei - a guy I have liked for 5 years. He is almost 17. Friends - my "big sib" Liz. Leah - best friend. Robin F. - best friend. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, hopeful. I felt happy and hopeful that me and Andrei would get together. I made a connection to the following day. Andrei came to My school and Milton didn't tell me. I told Liz to tell me if ever she saw him here, so Liz told me in my dream and I went out to talk to him.
