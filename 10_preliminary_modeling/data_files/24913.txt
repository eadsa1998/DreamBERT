I was doing a play, and we did lots of improv work. I think it was a school play, though it seemed like an acting camp I went to over the summer. Then we were doing the play, and the music was all off, so we had to improvise in front of the audience. Then I was really made at Olive (who happens to be my worst enemy), so I called her a bitch and then I woke up. Setting: In a theater, and backstage. Characters: summer camp actors; Olive, my worst enemy. Feelings and Thoughts: Worried. Olive was being really bitchy yesterday, so I know where that came from.
