The Pushed Aside Dream. I created an idea for a skit and then I see some famous actress doing my part, Jill St. James. I think she and two actors put jock straps on over their pants. It's a statement about women being oppressed. Now I'm with a group of women and we're doing the skit. I comment to some woman that I had the idea first, really. I feel a little embarrassed, like I'm being immodest or pushy. I look at the script because I can't remember exactly how it goes. We go to a men's auto shop class and begin. I play the part of a welfare mom. The man says there's no space available for me and I eloquently say, "If I were a man, there would be. I'm a welfare mom, etc. etc." It was well received. Now the group bows and I prepare to bow, the group keeps getting larger until I'm off in a corner by the wall and no one can see me at the end of the line. The applause is warm. As we prepare to leave, a man who is a manager is interested in my SKILLS.
