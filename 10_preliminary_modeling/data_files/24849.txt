I forget most except that these 2 guys get in a fight. The one who wins is saying "Would you do this to me?" The other guy just laughs. The guy who wins says, "Well, then suck this." He puts his penis all over the other guy's mouth. Later they are walking on rocky hills and the guy who lost is wiping his mouth with a towel and saying "Aw, that's disgusting." Setting: Out in nature, a lot of rocks. Characters: Two guys I don't know. I wasn't one of them. I saw from a distance away. Both ugly. Feelings and Thoughts: Disgusted. It was disgusting. Why am I like dreaming about pornography? Guys are so gross sometimes.
