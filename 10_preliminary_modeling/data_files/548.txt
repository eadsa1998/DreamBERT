My father is telling me about my birth being special. I am with him, my sister and her friend, Clair and we are making decorations from plastic leaves and flowers for some occasion. My father is emotional, bordering sad, in telling me about my birth and that I nearly died. It seems there was some other secret but I don't find out what it was. My mother is upset that he is telling me this.
