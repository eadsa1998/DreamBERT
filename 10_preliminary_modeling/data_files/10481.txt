I hear Father Andrew and a military man discuss war and casualties in El Salvador; large numbers of persons killed. Then I see the military man who looks like a toy soldier: I see him get up and stand up, stock still, and then FALL FLAT ON HIS FACE. He falls with a squooshing sound.... He hits his face flat on the floor and is DEAD. I run to Father Andrew and embrace him and LORD HAVE MERCY....
