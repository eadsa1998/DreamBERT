One day I was invited to a party and if you brought a dog you had to put it in a cage in a pen and there were other dogs there. I took my dog [Bonnie] and I put her in the pen but the other dogs were really mean and fierce, so when I got back from the party to get my dog I saw all the other dogs wrestling with her, so I took Bonnie right out of the cage and I shut it closed and all the other dogs were waiting at the gate for their owners.
