I don't remember much. I only remember that I was in the Macchu Picchu ruins. This is a place that I know since I have lived in Cuzco. I also saw myself on the highway and I saw a stone wall entrance. I do remember a sensation of anguish. I saw myself crying; I wanted to remain in Cuzco. I missed my homeland.
