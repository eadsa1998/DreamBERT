I was working in the post office. There was a Jewish girl. She kind of was stuck on me and I was intimating her every once in a while. Carter filled his pants and he was holding them a certain way and yelled for me to come and see it. He yelled at John. I came into the shop and Kugler was working. I said, "Why are you working on this shift?" and he said that was the right shift and I was supposed to be working also. I disagreed with him, then later it dawned on me that he was right.
