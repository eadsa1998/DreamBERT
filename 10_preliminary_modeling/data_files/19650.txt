I purchased a book containing about 6 plays by George Bernard Shaw. It is one of the "Modern Library" series and cost $1.25. I suddenly remember that I already have a book of Shaw's works, and begin leafing through just acquired volume to determine the amount of duplication, if any. It is a relief to find none duplicated.
