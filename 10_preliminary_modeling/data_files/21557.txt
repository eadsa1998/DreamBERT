I was on the lake shore. I saw a small white cloud about 10 feet off the ground hanging over us, then another one, bigger, come over and came down to the earth and disappeared. I looked way over the lake and the clouds were coming over the lake. They seemed to be way down on the lake. Ann and I were down in a valley. I looked up and saw Barbara and another girl on top of the hill. I had a small bonfire. It was dark. My brother Steve walked away from me and then was coming towards me and I was pointing a stick at him as he came at me.
