I went and picked about 45 Christmas trees and I hauled them to lots of different places and with the leftovers I put (them) in Christmas stands along the freeway. Setting: The Christmas tree farm where I picked this year's tree, the place where I horseback ride, and the freeway 280. Characters: There were no people or animals in my dream except me. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, content. I felt happy and kind of content, but no other feelings.
