I was at Nana's. It was someone's birthday. I went to walk into the dining room and I heard a movie playing that sounded like someone masturbating. Poppa came around the corner and told me to get out of the room. I went to the lounge and there was nowhere to sit and I kept wandering back into the dining room, so I ended up just sitting on the floor of the lounge room. Uncle Wilbur came out of the dining room saying "what the hell?". Dad and Ezra were sitting in the lounge too. I text Mom to pick me up and then she was there. She and Dad were standing close and their hands were touching slightly. I checked my phone for a reply from her and she had sent me one a few minutes before she had arrived. I couldn't find my water bottle. I looked everywhere and I found a full cold one but then I saw my one on top of the car. It was pretty much empty. Clayton was in the front seat and I told him to get into the back.
