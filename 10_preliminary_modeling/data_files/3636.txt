I and another woman are entering a big auditorium. We want to get good seats so we can see the events on the stage and meet in the back with our small group easily. It will be very crowded soon, we know, because we went through this before. I go to the left rear side and get a folding chair and then decide to go to the right rear side as that's where the small group will meet, but the athletic team has reserved most of the seats in the back and so I change my mind again and go to the left rear side to find all the places are almost taken and finally decide on the aisle. The ceremonies are starting and I lean way over to see. It is Rosalie, the Mayor of E City doing a discussion or speech and she's written "Rosalie" on the blackboard. It's just one word, her own name. I laugh and share this with a woman next to me. Then a male actor comes in and waits his moment. As he gets up to take a leather bag up the aisle shouting his lines, I realize the fingers of my left hand are caught in the straps and I am running up the aisle behind him, desperately trying to get my fingers out. I am wearing a bridal gown and veil. I finally get unstuck and go back and sit down. I tell the woman how embarrassed I am, how conspicuous I was. [BL]
