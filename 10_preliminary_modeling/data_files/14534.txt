I had a hotel room. I went to it. There was an elevator (that was four sided). It was hard to get one though. There was a place on the stairs if you wanted to complain. Dan Aykroyd came with a bald head. We were told that if we saw famous people, to not go up to them saying "I loved you in..." Then I was on a lounge with some people I knew and a teacher. This guy started singing a song which was from Scrubs, and it was perfect for the situation we were in. The teacher also reminded me of Perry (Scrubs) and I was laughing. He asked "what's that from?" and I answered "Scrubs". Someone said that everyone was excited? Also, some time before I was watching Battlestar Galactica and Lee and Gaius were talking.
