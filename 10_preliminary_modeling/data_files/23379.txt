I'm at the Riding Stables. I am watching the horses. Somehow, I am responsible for putting one of the horses away. There is a dog running around the training field. I try getting the horse to cooperate. It lies down for me to untack it, but once I remove the saddle it bolts up and away. I know I'm in trouble. I go to report the incident to the office, saying I don't know where the horse has gone. The co-owner, Marta, is not too terribly mad, but I feel awful, stupid. I go to look for the horse and pass behind the stalls where a school group is playing baseball. I'm on my way down the road when I see a girl/woman riding the horse towards me. She is wearing a bright red dressage jacket and beige jodhpurs. I flag her down. She very nicely tells me the horse was wandering around her (very exclusive) riding school. I thank her profusely for finding it. She turns over the makeshift reins to me, which I try to fix with string. She tells me to attach my string to the blue end as it's stronger. Meanwhile, just before as I'm passing the baseball field, I forgot to relate that my 12-year old son had just been let out of school and I ask him if he saw the horse. He said no. I said I needed to look for it. That's when the woman rode up. After I retrieved the horse, I took it back to its stable where two guys were waiting with one horse already saddled. Marta asked me to saddle up the renegade horse as they were going for a trail ride. I was happy for them (but sad for me).
