We were at a shop. This lady and I were poisoning apples. I was driving and I took off from the lights but then I had to stop quickly and I didn't stop in time and I hit the car in front of me. It then hit the car in front and that kept happening down this very long, busy street (domino effect). At the next set of lights, there was a huge accident. I asked Mom what I should do and she said "die". She brought me to this road that I had trouble with and I said "Are you trying to kill me?". She said it was so we didn't have to go to jail. Ezra was also in the car.
