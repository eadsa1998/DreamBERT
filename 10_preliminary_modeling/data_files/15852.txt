It was then this Friday and I was talking to Dad about something and he mentioned some dates and it didn't seem to add up. I realised that I'd gotten my dates mixed up and missed every job on this week. I freaked out and triple checked and wondered why I hadn't been called when I hadn't shown up. I put it down to enjoying these few days off and losing track of time. I didn't know what to do about it, but was feeling stressed. Markiplier had joined our forum and had made a few computer related posts asking about stuff I didn't even understand. I thought I should delete the posts I made about him in the Celebrity Crush Thread.
