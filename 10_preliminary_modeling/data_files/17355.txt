My boyfriend Jeremy was going to leave without giving me a hug or kiss goodbye.  I was seriously hurt.  I went to the window in the living room and flipped him off. That clued him in to come back.  We were crossing a parking lot and there was an old man with a cane in distress.  He needed help.  Then things became like Simpson's.  I was Lisa, in a wheel chair, and Bart had a bum leg.
