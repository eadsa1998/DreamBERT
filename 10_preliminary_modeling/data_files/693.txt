I was sleeping and became aware of trying to wake up. I tried to open my eyes and look at the celery green paint on the bedroom wall. Then I became aware of two invisible spirits standing at the foot of my bed (also in duplex in C City). I was afraid and then they let me know, telepathically, they mean no harm. After a while, I wake up.
