I was in a shop like building. I thought I was daydreaming. Sometimes people from school were there. We were going somewhere on buses and they sent two groups. I was in the same group as Calvin, Eugene and Dmitri. I was thinking this plane was going to crash and then bonding would occur between Eugene and I. Everyone split up though. Rebekah was sent into the lower school bus. I then had no pants on and as Ms Pascal locked up the doors I said "Wait!" and decided not to go. I put on pants and changed my mind and ran back out. Ezra was there and I asked "are they still there" and he said "yes". They were gone though. I ran down the street and saw the bus turn down the next street. It was dark and the buses had lights all over them. I saw a broken bus just outside with a note on it saying it'd take one month to repair. I went back and told this lady who worked at the school. As I was talking I saw a bus appear on another road (the road with the broken down bus had a bit of bush land behind it, and then other road). I saw a colourful portal like thing. The buses were coming back. The people were dressed in old-fashioned clothes. I said "you must've gone through some kind of time warp". They want back through the portal. Dad ran out of the building, but then it wasn't Dad. There were zombies. The guy (who had been Dad) stabbed them with a knife. I asked for one. I said 'don't we have to cut their heads off?'. When I cut them, it felt like cutting nothing. We finally killed this batch and then all these people started eating the dead bodies and started turning into zombies. I chopped this guys head off and then I yelled "No!" and I clicked on something and exited the area (it was a game now). I ended up in this underground part of a house. There were two groups. One had an option to talk to them. I had to block the door with dragons and I decided it was too hard and stressful and gave up. It was a quest on Runescape.
