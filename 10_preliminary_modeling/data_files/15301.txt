I was at school. Will from The Inbetweeners was there and a girl offered him sex but ended up laughing at him and walking away. Another girl took him into this cupboard. Later, I found them in there and I was laughing and I told a lady who then told everyone and they all came and stood around. Jay had a ring on his end finger. Will came out later and was annoyed at all the people that were there and blamed me. The principal guy was there. There was a short blonde girl and he pet her on the head. She had a slight Southern accent. She put her arm around him and they were talking. They walked together and she said she was the granddaughter of someone's Dad. They got pizza and she ate this white one. Someone found something and asked her "did you have an exchange?" and she had.
