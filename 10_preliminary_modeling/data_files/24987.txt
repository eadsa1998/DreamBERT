 I'm deer hunting in a party of four. I'm the party leader. We are in farm country in southern Montana. My classmate Emilio Kluck had shot a big deer at one spot where we are, so I align a pair of antlers to point at that spot like they are a gun. There are a lot of metal stakes in the farmland that I might have to pull out. I might want to cover the land up with a tarp. There is a crack there. It looks like an area near Farmington, where my grandparents live.
