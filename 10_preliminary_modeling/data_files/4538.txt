["French millionaire."] Ginny and Charla and I are traveling. We end up walking up a long flight of stairs. I am amazed I can walk this well. We finally get to the top and go to the edge of the building. I stop suddenly and sit down, afraid of the height we are at. I creep to the edge to see the beautiful buildings and fountains on the street below. We are in the fancy rich area of town. Charla goes over the edge. I am afraid she jumped and is dead. But she landed on a ledge not too far from the roof we are on and crawls back up just fine. Ginny and she goes walking around the roof and disappear. I am sitting there. I realize this is a penthouse where a french millionaire lives. He comes out and sees me there. I ignore him and this makes him want to charm me. He flirts and chats and I chat, not particularly interested. I notice he has beautiful eyes and is very handsome. I know this man isn't for me. I could not possibly attract him. But he buzzes around me determined to win my love. I tell him he has beautiful eyes. He wants me to stay and I am looking around for Ginny and Charla preparing to leave when they return.
