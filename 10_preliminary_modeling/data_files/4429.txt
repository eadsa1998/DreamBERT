["Can't find rehearsal."] Celeste is conducting a rehearsal. I need to be there. I see they are meeting in an open area outdoors, sort of a city square. People walking around chatting. I join them, late. I sit on a chair between a man and a woman who are sexually attracted to each other. I feel uncomfortable being between them as they are talking through me to each other. I suggest moving, but they go on there way. Now a man is telling me he and his friend can fix the van engine for $800. I am annoyed, because I can't afford it and have made other arrangements. They want the job and are trying to sell it to me. Then I notice my eyeglasses are shattered, like a windshield on a car. I am amazed I can still see well even though the damage is great. I look up to see the rehearsal has moved onto the stage area. Charla and I go there. I can't seem to get with them to rehearse. I tell Charla she can come along and be a part of it. I feel guilty I am not doing it right.
