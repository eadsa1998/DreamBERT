Reading about a nudist colony in Arizona, being told about it, wondering if it had any connection with peyote ceremonies. I and some woman were going to visit it; we got there, and wandered around for a while -- they grew a lot of different vegetables and flowers. Then I saw everyone had on sort of smocks, and I discovered that they had put them on so as not to offend me, because I wasn't mature enough to be there, which insulted me and yet at the same time, made me doubt if I was. Finally the head of the colony came up to me, a little man, and explained to me that I was partly mature and partly not, and having conflicts now, but I should try to be mature or else I wouldn't be -- if I didn't take off my clothes on the first day, I never would. Everyone was gathered around me -- all dressed -- waiting to see what I would do; I was now with my husband who also was urging me to do this. We went to a place where there were many different sized sinks filled with water; one fairly large one I decided to use, and started to undress. I got undressed, not particularly embarrassed, and got into the sink, which was large enough to sit in. I sat there relaxing, and wondered why no one else had taken off their clothes -- they were in various stages of undress or fully clothed; my husband had on swimming trunks and a shirt and was talking to someone and making no move to undress. It was strange.
