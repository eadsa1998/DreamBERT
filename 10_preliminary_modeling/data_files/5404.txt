I dreamed that someone had sabotaged Andrea, so I invited her to my house so she could escape. Marion came with us and so did Gabby. Then we were at orientation in the music building, and I can't remember anything else. Then I was living somewhere between New York and my high school. Harvey was playing in a concert and wanted me to tell him I loved him, but I just ignored him. Jennifer Anniston wanted to go on a date with my parents. Then last year's seniors were doing "senior mauling," where they beat up all the underclassmen. Ian kept tickling me and we were laughing. Tyler saw us and got upset because Ian was talking to me. I found a secret passage underneath Slate, and I led Ian through it. Then I was in Chinese class with Jasper and I got a 90% on my homework.
