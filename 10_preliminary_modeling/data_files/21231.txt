I was supposed to be a doctor. A lady patient was down on the operating table. I had a sharp knife. I stuck the knife into the woman's chest, in deep towards the heart and pushed up the knife, sort of ripping the body open. The woman was awake when I did that, then she would sort of feel the pain. I would give the knife to the other doctor and he would do the rest of the operating. There was another patient and I did the same for her. A couple of young fellows who were not sure of our ability were following us around and this made me nervous. I saw a lot of bread nearby.
