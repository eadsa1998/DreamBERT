The setting of my dream was in someone's house. There were some of my friends and some people I had never seen before. They were my age, different genders. My feeling during my dream was unpleasant. I was very angry. I got in a fight with one of my old friends, Rachel, and pushed her down some stairs and then got in my car and left but could not find my way home. Then I ended up in some city.
