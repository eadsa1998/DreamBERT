I was walking down a street quite late at night. The street was very large and it was quite dark. I was walking with a girl who I did not recognize. Suddenly I heard gunfire (of heavy pieces). Then I heard the scream of rocket bombs and everything began to explode around us. We were the only ones on the street and we began to run as fast as we could. Finally we went into this house and up many flights of stairs till we came to the last floor and the very topmost room of the house. When I opened the door a bomb hit the room. The dream then ended.
