I was lying in a bed in a dormitory. The patient on the ward named Reynolds was lying in the next bed. He arose and went to a bed several beds away and lay down. My blanket had been hanging over the edge of my bed and resting near his bed. I guessed that he had moved because he didn't like my blanket so near his bed. I felt insulted by his action. But I tried to see his point of view.
