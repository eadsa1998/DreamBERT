I dreamt that I met a girl that I had known about seven years ago when I was in high school. I happened to be iwth a friend of mine who is of recent times and had no association with the girl at any time. The three of us drove all over and I never seemed to get anywhere, but we were always driving. I remember it was raining and the three of us would stop and walk a while. The three of us all were on the approximate same age. I remember the girl was rather scantily clad. The main determining thing about the dream was that the girl was far more attractive in the dream than in real life, particularly her legs. We seemed to be getting nowhere. The dream more or less fizzled without anything happening but us walking and driving in the rain.
