I'm in my apartment which was made out of a school building. People stroll in and out. I see three men at the far end writing on a blackboard. I walk over to them and say, "I know it doesn't look like it, but you are in my home." He holds up the chalk eraser. I say, "I know, pretty unusual in a home, but its true." I walk them out, only to discover a classroom full of people. I realize the landlord has allowed them to share my entryway. So I suggest to the teacher that we share costs for a barrier partition. Then I see a man at the other end and I go to him and say, "What do you think you are doing? This is a home." He's seated on my couch with another woman; they are talking. He says to her, "How about coming over to my place?" meaning sex. She sighs and apologizes for being sympathetic, and thereby misleading him. She says, "Girls are like that." I say to him, "There's the front door." I'm disgusted with him. I look out on the porch and see Jake playing the piano, so I feel a little safer.
