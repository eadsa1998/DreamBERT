I dreamed that a bunch of kids from college went sledding on a real cold nite. It was about 10 below zero, but we were all dressed real warm (we thought). We went down on this great big sled and we kept on going and going and going. I tried to stop the sled, but couldn't. It seemed as if we were going for miles and miles. We finally stopped and we tried to get up off of the sled, but we were frozen right to it. I woke up then and was very cold, especially my feet and hands.
