I at was at Nana's. She told me a story about the fish. Mom was there too and sometimes it was our house. We fed the chickens, which were weird and made a noise like 'brr woof' which was them copying Rover's bark. There was a party or gathering. I left and saw some guys hiding in the bushes. They saw me and chased after my car laughing evilly and I put my foot down on the accelerator and I started crying. Later, they had attacked the party and had tied Rover up and killed all the fish etc.
