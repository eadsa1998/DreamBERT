["Horseman and I mentally communicate."]  A beautiful black horse and I are walking together. We seem to understand each others thoughts. A woman is trying to separate us. She is telling lies. My brother Jake is around somewhere. I avoid the woman and leap up on the horses back and I ride him away from the woman. Later, we are communicating with each other and I feel so comfortable and loved by this horse. Like it is a man in a magic spell. I wonder if we really are communicating with our minds or if I want to so badly, I am imagining it. A part of me knows it is a an I love in there and we must break the spell so we can be together again.
