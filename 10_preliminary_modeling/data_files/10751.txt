I have forgotten a lot of the dream I had last night. I remember that it was very vivid and detailed, but I can't remember a lot of the details. Another girl, I'm not sure who, but probably a friend in my dorm and I plotted the murder of another girl, dark hair, tall about 20. I know we had a good reason then, but I don't remember now. She murdered her. I was just the accomplice. I saw it all but didn't actually do anything. It was set in a hotel room on a lonely country road. My parents and the other girl's parents were there. They didn't suspect us, but there was a lot that was left that would incriminate us. When we checked out of the room, I told the bellboy to throw everything out that we had left, among things the black dirty hat. I guess things were getting pretty frightening and suspicious because when I awoke to find it all a dream, I was extremely relieved and could hardly believe it. Then I fell back to sleep and again began to dream again about the same thing. When I woke up the second time, I had that relieved feeling again.
