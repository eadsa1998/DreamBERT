["Who is stealing my dream program secrets??"] I am in an office at a University. A man is there checking on my dream program on the computer. I suddenly become afraid he is stealing my coding. I demand to know what he is doing. He is nervous and tries to soothe me. I don't accept his explanations. Now more men are in the room. I ask each one who they are. They are scientists from different disciplines. Chairs are lined up like in a classroom. More men come in. It is crowded. I think they are all here to steel my program. I accuse them of that. They smile and say no. That's not true. I am not convinced. I call the Dean of Students and demand to know who they are and for him to tell them they have to leave. I demand they leave. Finally they start to leave. I'm on to them now.
