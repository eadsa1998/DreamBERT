I went to see my friend Rick at his new job at a pharmacy. I was kidding him about his job and so he started kidding me about being pregnant. Then I said, "Oh, like you regret raising your child alone," and he said "Yes, I wish it had all been different and he had never been born." This shocked me because I knew it wasn't true and it was the first time I had heard him say this. Then I went upstairs to my house and I realized I had forgotten to feed my cats for a few days and I felt really bad and fed them two cans of food and they were all weak and bloated and sick looking. I realized if I couldn't even take care of my cats correctly I would never be able to take care of a baby.
