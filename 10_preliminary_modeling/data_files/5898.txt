Am in a business office where another chap and I are helping the former occupant to move out his stuff. Apparently I am to be the new occupant. One side of office contains many walnut shelves and drawers and we are looking thru them as the former occupant stands aside and observes. We check shelves to see if everything is packed. While reaching into deep lower shelves near floor, I find a stack of papers and without bringing them entirely out into open, I bend down and examine them. They appear to be personal letters on pink paper and while shuffling thru them, I see a $1 bill. I then slip out the stack and surreptitiously place them in the back of a drawer where I know no one will find them so that I can later examine them in detail when I am the sole occupant in office. I do this switch of location quickly and former occupant doesn't see anything. While checking other drawers, we find two long, slender and very shallow drawers near the bottom of the drawer section. At first they look like part of the structure and not drawers. But we manage to pull them out, the other man and I (not the former occupant) and we see they contain art supplies, ink and brushes, tubes of paint, all of which probably date back to some other former occupant of that office of some years ago. Apparently he had forgotten them.
