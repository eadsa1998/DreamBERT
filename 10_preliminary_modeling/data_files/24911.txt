I was trying to see if I could make a compost pile with a pile of old clothes, and this big yellow bug started flying after me. And then my alarm went off. I woke up and went back to sleep (in my dream). Setting: In my kitchen and in my bed. Characters: My mom and the big yellow bug were the only ones in the kitchen. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared. I hate waking up twice. Sometimes I'll dream that I woke up, took a shower, do all that and sometimes make it all the way to school, before I really wake up.
