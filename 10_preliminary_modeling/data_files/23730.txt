In bed with a woman, in my (and at one time my oldest sister's) old room in my childhood home - making out.  The room is messy and her lover / boyfriend is asleep on the floor.  But she and I like each other.  She is tall and slim.  Dark hair?  We make out and I touch her very softly near her pubis, stroking.  She gives me permission to touch her sex organs but I tell her I've never touched a woman.  She pulls my hand in.  I touch her the way I would like it.  While this is happening, I sense a dark presence above me, turn to see a dark figure - male - hovering over me, really getting in my face.  It is a bit threatening, but with a neediness about it, something it is trying to inflict on me brought on by its own anger / fear / helplessness.  I am frightened but also annoyed and I am aware that I can overcome my fear / keep that fear away, by just telling it off.  Which I do.  Something like, I just rouse myself up enough to yell at it to go away.  Then I go right back to focus on the woman again.
