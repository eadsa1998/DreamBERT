I was climbing through a window of a place that I somehow took for a drugstore. I saw my sister sitting on a chair. She had just gotten married and I ran over to kiss her. While kissing her I picked her up off the chair and started twirling her around but she was too heavy for me and I had to quit. There was a crowd of people standing around and when I said that she was too big for me to twirl around everybody laughed.
