I was in my house with my brother and a friend when we got a phone call. My brother and I picked it up. He kept teasing me and showing off for my friend by pretending he was going to pick up the phone, then not doing it. I kept asking him, but he wouldn't, so I screamed at him and he did. I was talking to my neighbor across the street (her house looked different again). Some girl, who I don't know, kept telling me her Dad was crazy and she was scared, so I called the police and they came to my house. All of a sudden her crazy father was chasing me and I was on a downtown street like Main Avenue, but with different stores. When I was hiding in the stores, people were very helpful. I wasn't sure if the man was chasing me, but I found out he was. Then a man I didn't know kept helping me escape. Finally I entered the store and this lady said I could hide there. She told her two kids to come downstairs and I went up a long flight of beige-carpeted stairs. They were very high and when I got to the top, I looked down and saw tons of white mansions and swimming pools. I was scared because of the height, but it was at a long, interesting waterslide. I wasn't sure if I should go down because I was afraid the man would be down there. Finally he entered the store and he told me not to hide because he used to play here with me when I was a little girl. (So he sort of turned into my father.) So I went down. I remembered when I was a girl and I would throw a ball down the slide and it would land on his head.
