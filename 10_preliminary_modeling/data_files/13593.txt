I was at school. I was with Calvin somewhere. It was home time and the office had a line for Greeks and Macedonians to sign out. We went there one day and you also had to be born in January. We were standing behind Eugene. I read his sheet and it mentioned his father (Abraham) and his mother's last name was Cuthbert, which reminded me of Elisha Cuthbert. His home was called something weird like Bertz. His street was Schub and I asked Mom where it was later and she was like "why?". The lady at the desk (where you had to sign out) told Calvin that she would refer us if our birthdays were in January. We told a teacher and they said she had lied. I went to the toilets and some were open. I went into a cubicle and this girl stood outside, asking if I was female. They gave me a dildo. I like "what the hell are you giving me this for?!". Then I was watching Entourage and Turtle had a dildo of 'himself' on the bed. It was like rounded at the bottom and went into a point and had a smiley face on it.
