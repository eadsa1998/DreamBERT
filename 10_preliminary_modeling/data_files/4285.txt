["Speeches are fun and easy."] I am in a room like Toastmasters with the tables in a "V" formation. I am standing at the speaker's end, making impromptu speeches on familiar subjects, like dreams. I seem to be doing just fine and feeling comfortable. Celeste is around helping. I make speech after speech, happy I am doing so well and feeling comfortable.
