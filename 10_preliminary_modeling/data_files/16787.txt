I remember being in Mrs. Shaw's class and finding out what I got for grades. She gave me a C in an elective class titled "Heather," which I thought was unfair because I thought we'd only had that class one or two times. I am now in Mrs. Saint's class. There is a drink on her desk, with a piece of liquorice in it for the straw. Rick asked if I liked to drink (alcohol), either that or the topic somehow came up. I kept dancing and saying I wanna learn how to dance. I saw Audrey talking to Joey and I was going to ask her if she wanted to go to a dance with me. By the time I'd asked, I thought she was Shannon who ignored me and left the room. I left to catch her (worried about leaving class and getting in trouble). I asked her again, wondering if she hadn't heard me. By this time she was yet another girl, Alison. I told her she could have at least said "no" but she waved bye and kept walking. I realized I didn't want to go to class (and it wouldn't matter anyway because it was a dream) so I didn't. I saw Beth and said, "Hey Kerry! Hey, Ker!" I was going to ask her to dance, but she dematerialized as she walked through the glass of an award case and disappeared. Then I asked this boy to dance. He said yes, and we were dancing ok but I said, "This isn't what I want," and so I asked Louise who also agreed to dance. Then I remember knowing the bell was going to ring. I intuitively felt that when the bell rings, I'd probably wake up, so I tried as hard as I could to stay in the dream after the bell rang, and I managed not to wake up. Then I saw Mrs. Saint again. She didn't seem to remember me leaving class. I told her I hadn't realized the pun Rick had used before (asking about alcohol when there was "liquor"ice on her desk). Some people were leaving the school building by now but others were staying around and moving out rather slowly. It sort of looked like a mall now that I think about it. I realized these people were stopping to "recognize art and love."
