I'm in a bathtub and draining the water. I stand up, being careful not to slip on the soap bars. I step into a second tub of cool water and rinse. I then dry off and get into a bathrobe. I hear a knock at the door. I wonder if I should ask, "Who is it?" before I open it. It might be a bad person. I don't ask, and it is Bonnie. I say, "Come in, but as you can see, all my furniture is gone. I'm moving." [BL]
