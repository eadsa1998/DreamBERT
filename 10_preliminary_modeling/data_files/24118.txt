      I am then in front of a crowd of people who are expecting me to sing. I am famous. I sit and try to sing but words are not coming to me. (I am sitting on a bench.) I say I'm not channeling words right now. Then I start to sing a song that already exists. It starts out "And I..." It's day outside and this scene exists outside.
