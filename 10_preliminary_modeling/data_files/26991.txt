I dreamt I saw one of the assistant buyers in a department store where I worked. Her face wasn't clear, yet I was certain it was she. I asked her how one of the girls was. This particular girl was a very close acquaintance of mine during the time I worked in the store. I can't remember if I received an answer, but I remember I was disturbed.
