I had decided just to take it easy, as I had all the supplies I would need to paddle a kayak back to the mainland when the weather was right. I looked out into the distance, and saw the shadows of the scary swampland in the foreground, and in the distance, the faint shadow of safer large island or mainland. I was resting in a hammock on the beach inside a shack. It was nice out. I wanted to read my book. Then I got a call on a radio from my brother, who was out at sea and coming in -- he needed help, and was thirsty. He had a native guide with him. The two them were in a raft floundering in the surf. I didn't want to go out and waste my supplies. I filled up an empty Gatorade bottle with tap water. I was surprised there was tap water here. I threw it out to them. Then the surf brought them in on their own. He is always getting into situations like that, where he is underprepared and I have the right supplies. I look at my green kayak and mentally prepare myself for the trip back away from this island.
