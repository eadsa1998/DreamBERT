 I am listening to a Bob Mould CD on my stereo. I take all the CD's out of the stereo so it won't skip funny. The Bob Mould CD I put in is called Pretty in Pink, or Pink Crush or something like that. I have heard the first song that is played. The center of the CD player is oblong, like an oval. The CD's won't play correctly because of this.
