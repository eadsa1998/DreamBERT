 I'm at a small gathering. My friend Melanie McDyss is there, with others. I jump up to the chandeliers and put a crumbled up piece of bread with melted cheese in the glass case that surrounds one of the bulbs, on top of the bulb. This seems to be a feat because no one else can do it. I jump up and reach in and put it out of the light casing as well.
