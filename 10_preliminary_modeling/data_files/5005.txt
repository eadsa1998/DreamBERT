I am called to leave with Mabel and Orville. I turn at the door just before I go in and see members of the Counseling Department waving. I feel sad because the end of the world is coming and we will all die. I call out, "I love you," and turn to go. I am a little embarrassed and say, "I suppose it's corny, but it was my last chance to say it to them." We go inside the house. My Uncle Joel calls me to the other room. I am hesitant because I'd already put my stuff in a bedroom. I go into the living room and sit on a couch. Leroy is there and there is instant attraction and warmth. He sits next to me, very close, and puts his arm around me. I know this is wrong, but I want it. I struggle with my conscience a little, but it's a foregone conclusion. He complains bitterly how he never measures up to his father's expectations. A stray kitten and a cousin. It's a double reason to stay away, but I love being near him. I feel warmth and excitement. Both Uncle Joel and he assure me they are still working on marketing my script. I am a little annoyed and frustrated. [BL]
