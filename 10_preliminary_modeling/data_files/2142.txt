I'm doing my newsletter. It's the last issue. I am waiting for two women from Disabilities Coalition to bring back the near final draft. There is room for one more article. A chubby male student comes in late and I say, "You can do the article." The women bring in the paper. I go to look at it, saying, "You're late; I thought you'd never get here." We are in a tiny bathroom and I say, "I wish there was more room here." We could finish the paper here, but we go down the narrow hall to the larger room. Maria has two boxes and I think it's full of letters to the newsletter. I say "Darn! Now that we've finished, we get response," but then I see it's mostly full of foodstuff and boxes of envelopes, so it's OK. The chubby student comes and says a girl in a wheelchair student just left, so we step to the huge plate glass window to wave goodbye. She's on a boat on a huge river just outside the window. The river is higher than usual and muddy. I see objects floating in it. The boats are all buses and pickup trucks. I see a school bus that suddenly sinks. I am concerned and ask, "Are there any people on board?" I then see people opening windows and an older woman holding her breath. They get out OK sputtering. I don't have to rescue them, though I am forced to do so. Another school bus goes by safely.
