I moved in to my new place.  My boyfriend Jeremy was asleep in the middle of the room.  I got up when I heard something thrown.  My housemates (male) came in.  I told them we'd been broken into.  There was a note to "Josette 2" saying I was fat and ugly.  One of my high school chemistry classmates Darla 'Marla' Hernandez was the first signature, followed by a classmate 'Guy' Jon and about five other names.  I was hurt and couldn't figure out why they'd done it.  I told the guys about the 'Madeleine "sucks" note that was left on our door bulletin board in the dorm.  I left Jeremy sleeping and went to get some food.  My housemate George was in the kitchen doing the same, and he told me to help myself to the sub sandwich.  I replaced the meat with cheese.  I went into the living room.  I went to London with my brother Stuart in an instant.  He dropped me and I fell away, miles away, over the London bridge, and a rocky water's cliff.  It was like a roller coaster.  When I got back I realized my shirt was gone, so I put another one on.  I heard something, and checked.  Sure enough, the hateful people were back.  I looked out the front door to see my elementary schoolmate Leticia, the watchman.  She tried to scoot away but I told her calmly to come, I wanted to ask her something.  The others came out.  Another old schoolmate Kathy and more.  I realized that all the names on the list were forgeries.  I still couldn't figure out why they were mean.
