Bonnie and Mateo and I are traveling, planning to go to Paris. Some crazy woman from India interferes and we lose Bonnie. Mateo and I are going to get on a train but if we do, Bonnie will never find us and I'll end up having to care for Mateo. This was not my plan, to be baby-sitting when in Paris. I try to back track, and remember clues. I must search a computer data bank for info that will help. I feel thwarted. Now I am trying on clothes, I saw a pretty suit. I think will look nice. I put it on: a leather suede jacket, a wool textured skirt, a lavender blue silk like blouse. Corinne is there and feels the material and says, "This is wrong for you, textured like that. It will be hard to work." I am annoyed at her. I want the outfit to work. I like it. Corinne has laid out a bunch of pretty earrings and I like three of them, blue glass and clear glass. I would like to have them. She has them out over my outfit, making it hard to get to my things. I look in the mirror. I open the top button on the blouse and say, "I like it a bit open like this, what do you think?" She agrees, but is still reserved and negative. The outfit feels heavy and cumbersome, but I like it. I feel the hem line at my ankles. Something about a person from India (like Chopra? I better beware of them).
