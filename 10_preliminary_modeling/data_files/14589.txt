I was in a car with Mom. We drove down the road and there were guys on the road selling smokes from another country, which were heaps stronger than normal smokes. We were at the lights. Police came down the road. Mom waited without indicating. When the cops were gone she went to the guys and bought some. It was like marijuana or something. I was then somewhere else and I had a list of stuff to watch or listen to. It mentioned Michael Palin's Himalaya's and Electric Light Orchestra and comparing it to some new stuff I'd never heard of. There was something about Blue Oyster Cult, but it wasn't actually them. I was then at a shop and got some noodles. It had 'stirfry' and had these yuck carrot bits. There was a cake with 40.3g of fat in a small slice. Mom made a cake too that was full of fat.
