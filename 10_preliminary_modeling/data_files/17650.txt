I remember whipping around some sea cucumber in an aquarium, but how that relates to anything else, I have no idea.  There was some sort of...gizmo? I guess it was a government project or something, because it was supposed to be off-limits. I think I was with one or two other people who went in and got it. Took us a little bit to figure out how to work it. It essentially looked like a 3-foot fan, with the protective housing around it. By holding onto it, we could sort of fly around.  We ended up somewhere, I guess with choir. I was going to demonstrate how to use the thing, explaining how it could make you fly. Something about lettuce wings. I guess I went to demonstrate, and something gave it away that I was the one flying, the gizmo had nothing to do with it. My choir instructor Jack said, "I knew it!" One girl was especially eager and I guess jealous, but wasn't aware that I was the one flying. She wanted to try the gizmo so climbed out on a tower roof- this was about the same time as I began my demonstration and right when it was becoming apparent it was me in control of levitating, not the machine. She fell and died. I felt it was my fault because even though I didn't know it was me, not the machine, I felt that subconsciously I must have known and so put the girl at risk, even though nobody else seemed to blame me.
