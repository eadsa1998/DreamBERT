Granny died. The wake was on the same night. Mom and I went to this house. I didn't go to the wake because I thought it was stupid. I was upset later. Then I was at school and we had an excursion to the shop. Silas and I were there and there were these videos of people and chairs (I don't remember what was happening). Someone was chasing a ferret and I was thinking about Porky. I was telling Dad why I wasn't at school.
