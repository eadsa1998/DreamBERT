I was on a farm with Renee Perez and either her husband or Norman.  They had been hard at work plowing the fields and doing something else-they had had to make a special trip into town for whatever it was.  I came across an enormous snake in a ditch alongside the field.  It was curled back and forth several times, but I judged from its thickness that it must have been 20-30 feet long.  I thought about stabbing its head with a pitchfork, but they said it would bite me if I missed.  It was a "black venom snake."  Later it poured down rain and flooded the whole field.  We stood in the doorway of a garage and watched it.  Renee Perez lamented the fact that the whole day's work was wiped out.  I tried to console her.  The three of us also stood together in the doorway and tried to keep the floodwaters out.
