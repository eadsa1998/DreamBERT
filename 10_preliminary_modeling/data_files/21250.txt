I was at Charlie Charvat's home. He had a swampy spot that was grown over by a viney tree that was full of roots. Charlie and I had axes and started to chop up the roots one by one. We had the place cleaned up spick and span and there seemed to be no mud left there. They told me to look at myself and I looked at my face and arms and I had black spots of mud all over myself. Then all at once Charlie and I were on his bed. I picked up a pillow and tossed it on the other bed and I noticed it was overrun with ants. I lay on the bed and covered up with the bed cover and imagined of sleeping. I was going to load some kind of wagon. It was covered with a complete cover. I was inside, so I opened some of the top and I could feel a little fresh air within because it was stuffy.
