There was some food somewhere (like a dinner or something was going on). Eugene's father Abraham was there and I was thinking that maybe I could find out what his name was. I was looking at Eugene's Facebook page. He was coming over now too and I had Dawson's Creek as my wallpaper, although I only remember seeing Dawson clearly. I thought maybe I should change it incase he saw it. We were now at Nana's. I went inside and Emery was on a lounge in the lounge room. Dad and I were going to go scuba diving or something. We were going across the water to get to the place and there were waves. This girl said that the instructor was "really cute". We got across and then we had to walk along next to this wall. The waves came up and so we had to hold this rail so we didn't get pulled away. We went into a restaurant. This foreign guy sat us at a table and brought us food. I was thinking that the waves were too strong so we were going to have to do it another day. We went to a school another day and Dad had gone there to talk to the principal. I was friends with him.
