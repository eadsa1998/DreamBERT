I was at Mom's and we were having dinner. Ezra was being slow. Mom and Darren were at the table. We had gnocchi and they put hardly any on my plate so I asked for more and Darren did. We put sauce on it. Someone said something about West Virginia and where it was near and Darren was singing Wheeling West Virginia and I was like "Yeah, I think, what are the lyrics for that damn song?" and Darren was like "I was just joking". I said something back that I can't remember.
