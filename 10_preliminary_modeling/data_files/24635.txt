I was having a party for my birthday! It was Saturday. We were just kind of hanging out and playing a lot of different fun things and making shirts. We'd take a white shirt and design it with dark blue puffy paints that were all glittery, covered with really shiny glitter that was golden and silver. There were also other colored paints to use, and the whole party we had was really fun! Setting: In my house. Characters: My friends, I don't know who, and me, in pants and a little coat over my shirt. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy. I was really excited, because my party is really soon!
