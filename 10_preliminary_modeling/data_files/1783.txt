I'm going to teach a lecture on forest fires to a 3rd (4th is crossed out) grade class. I am practicing the lecture with their teacher. I am apologizing that I don't have much content information. I go to the library to find an encyclopedia to get more information. I'm going to show maps and talk about how the fires burn off all the old tangled growth that leaves room for new growth. Then, as we are going to the classroom, the thing shifts and we are now going to a cafe, De Frisco's, to reminisce on the Germany Trip with 3 or 4 other women. We sit around a table. I suggest another member of the Germany group show her pictures. But just before she starts, I pull mine out and start with the Palace of Versailles. I find as I start talking, I have lots to say and it is interesting to the others. Then we decide to play baseball. I hit a ball and run for first base and was nearly "put out." The base was real close. Then I show someone a lovely wooden panel I was allowed to bring back from Paris. It fit on top of a piano we had here. Then we had to move a table that had pretty things on it back to make more room for second base. The table leg slipped and some things fell. We decided we'd meet again to finish our talks as we'd already been there 4 hours. I wrote the names of the ones who will speak and in what order. I consulted with Rena who said she would do her talk if she'd had enough to drink. [BL]
