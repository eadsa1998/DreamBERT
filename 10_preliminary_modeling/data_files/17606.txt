I was in a classroom building, trying to figure out which way to get into the lecture hall.  I tried several but they didn't work.  One went up to the balcony where I met my housemate Andre.  I left and wandered around the campus a bit, through the woods.  I followed a pathway trying to get up to the main road, but the path kept turning on the hillside so I couldn't reach the road.  Eventually I ended up back at the lecture hall.  My teeth fell out and I was distraught.
