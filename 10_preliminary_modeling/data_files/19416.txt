Me, my mother, my sister, and my cousin were standing in front of a building I believe to be the health center. I was telling them that I signed up with a doctor to be an assistant, and I was saying that I thought the doctor was fairly good-looking and I was describing him when he came out of the building. He saw me and waved and smiled as he walked towards us. He asked if we were busy for lunch. Then I couldn't believe it, my mother started flirting with him. It wasn't like her at all. It was like she was drunk or drugged. I was so embarrassed and so was the doctor. He said that he had forgotten his keys, so I told my mother to ride with my cousin and I stayed behind to apologize. I knew he didn't forget his keys; he just wanted to get way from my mother.
