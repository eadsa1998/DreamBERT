I was in high school- my math teacher Mr. Johnson's class, I think.  I ran into a classmate from elementary school, Carrie Singer.  We were watching a movie, and we whispered to each other.  We were sitting close, and she confided in me that she's bisexual.  We talked about maybe trying something out together.
