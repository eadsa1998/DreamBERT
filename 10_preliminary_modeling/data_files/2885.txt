I am at the lower levels and there are scary things around, ugly things, monsters maybe. I decide to go upstairs to heaven. I walk upstairs and try to see prettier things, like angels, and fairies, I think. I manage to create foggy clouds and leaves. "It's either fog or blue sky up here," I think. I am crying. something about healing. The people up there are going to do surgery on my feet. They begin and I feel queasy because there is no anesthetic and I might feel pain. I am aware that I won't feel pain if my mind is positive and believes it. I am worried I'll forget that in the middle of the surgery. They do my right foot and are working on my left foot. I am cradled by Katrina and Lucy, who rock me and soothe me and I cry. I am happy I am being healed.
