Our hunting expedition was in deepest Africa and we were going through the dark underbrush. I was the last one in the group. All at once caught by surprise I was caught by a python snake. Struggle as I would, I could not break away from the death grip. Gradually I felt my strength leave me and I hollered to no avail. Suddenly I awoke with a bang on the dormitory door. My covers were wrapped tight around my body.
