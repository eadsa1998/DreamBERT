I was somewhere, outside. Everyone was at war. There was a raft and Napoleon Dynamite was playing on a TV on the raft. Some others and I went on the raft. Then it wasn't me anymore, and it was third person. The Beatles were now on the raft. Once they reached where they were going, only John Lennon and Paul McCartney were on the raft. No-one knew what happened to the others.
