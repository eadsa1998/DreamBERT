Some people got powers and it was a well-known event. I could read minds. I was driving with Dad and some pale people were standing in the road -- they were vampires. We went to some place and there were some vampires there. We got in the car and locked the door. I went through the wrong set of lights and there was a big hill which was fun to drive fast on. Then I had to walk back because it was quicker. I had to go over a bridge. This guy did an apprentice thing from 11pm-1am which would later lead to paid work and he said 'it looks promising'. I got a box in the mail with a work uniform.
