We're now in Cedar Park and it's taken this long before I've ever had a dream that I can remember because I have been just going and going and going all through the days, and when I sleep and when I wake up, it's like, "Bleah...." There's like nothing that I can remember. But today I can remember one. I dreamt that was going to Modern Media College, over for some kind of an introductory thing, and it was this real informal, casual meeting at this McDonald's cafeteria thing. And they had this yellow awning and stuff, and it was real colorful. And this one guy came over to me, kind of like a teenage student assistant type of thing, and he gave me this paper with some writing scribbled on it. And he said, "This is a test. You need to pass this test if you want to get in. You need to turn it in, in Orientation tomorrow." And he gave me two papers. One paper was like writing of questions, and another paper was a worksheet. And this writing was like in pencil. I could barely read it. And in my dream I was out at this open park place and it was almost dusk, and I had this CC TV set up at a picnic table. And I was reading this stuff and the sentences didn't make sense. You had to fill in the blank. One of the sentences that I can remember was, "The mixer marked ________ before you can walk." And I wrote, "Queue up," for some reason. And I don't remember what the other things were, but they were just jumbled and they didn't make any sense. And I was real concerned that they weren't making sense to me. And then I woke up.
