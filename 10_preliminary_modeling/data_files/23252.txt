There is a Chinese prisoner in the custody of someone I know.  He doesn't look Chinese, and his skin is dark gray.  He seems to be a terrorist who participated in some horrific act like the attack on the school in Russia.  I want to take out all my hostility against him, and since he is a prisoner, he is at my mercy.  I inform his custodian that I am going to kick the prisoner in the head first, but I don't remember actually doing so.  I wake up before doing anything violent to him as far as I can remember.
