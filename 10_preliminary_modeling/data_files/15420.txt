I was at a shop but then I was in a hall at a house and it kept going back and forth. I was dating Robert Sheehan and his name was something else and his last name was Brown, but he was basically Dmitri from Misfits without a power. I thought someone was following me and I screamed and he came but there was no-one there. Then we were at a shop. We found this pile of dead bodies in this toilet cubicle. This guy who looked like Ben Mendelsohn was an old friend of someone in our group and was an interior designer. We ended up getting attacked by a killer. They had these leprechaun/elf things. They had a few powers and we went to run outside and Dmitri grabbed some chocolate mints. There was a car that would only run if you were eating chocolate mints. We were waiting for it to register us eating them and the leprechaun things were coming closer. It finally started and I was driving (though I was in the middle of the backseat and was reaching over. We went to this beach and there were heaps of people and they all turned around. We ended up getting out of the car and they attacked us again. Later we were at a party and this guy mentioned the Ben Mendelsohn guy and this guy said 'oh yeah, I remember [different name], he's a [different career]' and we were confused. He went over and said 'sorry about the divorce' and Ben was like 'yeah, I came out 5 years ago'. Later, he was married to this guy and then realised he was straight. He kept talking and then he realised we caught him out as the 'goblin king'. We trapped him in the car and said 'in 2 minutes there's going to be a car accident and you're going to die'. We left and he just sat there. This guy who was the brother of someone in the car (which was a 4WD) was driving towards it. Ben 'teleported' out of the car and in front of the guy driving towards it and stopped it. This caused him to kill these other people because he now had control of him. He shot down these dancing kids and their parents.
