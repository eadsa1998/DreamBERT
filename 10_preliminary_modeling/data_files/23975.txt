Dad had rented a house for a vacation. They had invited a lot of people and all different types - the Fishers, some relatives from overseas (4 old ladies), the actor from Sliders, Aunt Sarah and Uncle Bill, a supermodel and some more. He showed us around the house, the downstairs was huge but the sleeping quarters were like a ship. They were all in one room and were little cubicles that only fit the bed - some singles some doubles. On the other side of the room the "beds" were like airline seats that didn't fully recline and were very close. I was worried about where I would sleep because I wanted to sleep with Walter but he was "assigned" to one of the sleeping chairs. <br/
