I was working for my dream class instructor as a researcher.  The people in the lab were all mentally ill, and I was to help take care of them.  There were urine stains everywhere because not everyone could control themselves.  Most of the lab was very dark.  I sat down in a room at a computer, and had trouble figuring out how to get the sound through the headphones only, so I wouldn't disturb the clients.  I followed a client into a room with tanks and equipment like at the observatory.  They said they had to go to the bathroom, and that meant immediately.  I had to get a container for it.  Then, outside, there was a pond, and some dead lizards on the cement.
