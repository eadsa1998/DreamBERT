I am the owner of a gas station with my twin sister. I am the drudge. I work hard. Nothing seems to go right. I spill gasoline. I put in 20 gallons when he only asked for $10 worth and he won't pay the extra, in fact, he only pays $5. The cars only drive up to the first pump so I can't save time by serving two at once. I have to walk all the way to their car. My twin sister sloughs off and makes more work for me. She's the glamorous one, goes to acting school while I work to pay for it. I feel resentful.
