I had been napping and I knew I needed to do something but couldn't wake up or get my eyes open. Just walked through the house and did whatever it was I needed to do anyway. Matthew was much younger. Conversations with neighbors. Looking outside and realizing that I am still getting used to where I am now living. I forgot that it is a very short walk, across something that resembles a large, gravel parking lot, to a number of small stores. I asked him if he wanted to walk across this large gravel area to a convenience store and get a popsicle. I took some change from my wallet and placed it in my pocket. Popsicle in my pocket. The first one partially melted but I ate it anyway. A second and third one completed melted. None of the three had been in wrappers. Tennis courts surrounded by chain link fence. People playing on one of them. Different people playing on them now. I decided to walk down one small street that was lined with small shops, and then go home and make a list of the shops that were there that we might want to visit the future. The list was to remind us that they were there so we wouldn't get in the car and drive to other stores for the same thing. Driving down a narrow country road that was hardly big enough for two cars. It had been raining. Lots of water puddles. Some I tried to avoid. Mostly I tried to drive very slowly so the water wouldn't splash up on the car. I mostly didn't want it to splash on the windshield. I realized I slowly I was driving and wondered if there were any cars behind getting aggravated with me. When I turned around to look there were no other cars there. At that point, it also felt more as if I was walking.
