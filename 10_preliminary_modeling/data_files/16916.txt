For some reason I'm navigating a ferry from one port to another a fairly short distance away. It is full of people, some drunk, some slumped on the floor. I travel with some of my friends - in particular my friend Terry. He seems particularly stressed out about the journey. We both are, because we have this enormous ship in our control, but we don't really know what we're doing. Somehow we manage to get it into the port, but docking is a complicated process, and we don't know where we're meant to stop. The ship collides with the side of the wharf. We get off and find a bar where Terry's dad meets us. He is pleased that we managed to do it - for him it was a kind of test.
