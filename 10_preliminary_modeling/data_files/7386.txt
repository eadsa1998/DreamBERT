Our seats were two tables from the head table at which I saw C. H. seated. They were trying to unzip his jacket. I went to help. At the third attempt, I found it stuck because a chain had caught in it. He was so grateful that he asked me to have breakfast with him. I said I'd have to let him know. I'd come another time; but I changed my mind and followed him. I went to his room and told him so. I knew he was in my old room. The person in the other bed asked, "Who is this?" and he introduced me. I said I thought my former landlandy, Mrs. Mc. wouldn't mind if I came to breakfast. I thought if he were only older, he'd ask to marry me.
