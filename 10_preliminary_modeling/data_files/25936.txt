 I'm in the dirt lot behind Carter School after returning late one night from a baseball game. There are lights for the lot which are located on its northwest corner, by the alley. I switch the light on and off. I put some wine bottles by the north end of the fence that borders the lot on the east side. There is a man there who also went to the baseball game. He is on a bicycle, and it going to ride home.
