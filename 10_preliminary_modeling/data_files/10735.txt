My mother and I were driving through western New York State. We went through Rochester and could see lake Ontario in the distance. We then arrived in Freeport on our way to Erie. Somehow we had the idea that this was where the two lakes joined. We drove beside Lake Ontario through the little town and beside a very marshy section. A little ahead of us was a hill and we supposed that Lake Erie was on the other side. We saw a bridge going over the point where we entered the town. Just as we were about to turn around the hill, my alarm rang and I was very angry. I did want to see how the two lakes joined.
