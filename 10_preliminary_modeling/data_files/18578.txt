There was a truck engine. To start the truck, you had to take off the passenger side door from its hinges and insert it perpendicularly, parallel to the windshield and at the back of the engine, furthest from the bumper. It was big and heavy and I tried to do it, but I couldn't all by myself. ???. There were slots where they were suppose to go. I took a break and went to the dark lunchroom. Maureen was there and so happy. She was singing along with the catchy tunes that were playing and when I knew the words I sang too. Darlene started dancing and spun me around and around and around till I was dizzy. When I was tired I went to sit in the bathroom closet which had a hole in the door where the doorknob usually is. In the bathroom closet, I turned the light off because the security guard would see me in there in the dark. They'd figure I was up to no good, when really, I was just resting, waiting for my turn to go to the beach. While I was waiting, I was suppose to be making up the beds, and while looking out the window--when I was suppose to be making up my mother's bed--I caught the blanket on fire. It was a very cheap white blanket of synthetic material and it had big red flowers printed on it and brownish-green leaves. I tried to pull the cotton blanket over it (beige), but it was all lumpy, this bed. And you could smell the burned blanket all over the place. My father came in carrying a pair of Hush Puppy Shoes and said, laughing, "No wonder I had trouble getting these on. It took me all night. They're your shoes, Merri, not mine." I said, "Oh." Rudy was sitting on the floor trying on some old hiking boots of ours from the closet. They were beautiful, but the sole on the left boot was flopping off in front.
