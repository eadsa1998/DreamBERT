 An Australian class group photograph is being taken. I get pushed to the edge of the group in the crowded photograph. It's raining and dark outside. My friend Tom Napper and I are in a small shop. He buys candy. I have lent "Bedside Guide To Dreams" book to someone. That person returns it and the back cover is torn off.
