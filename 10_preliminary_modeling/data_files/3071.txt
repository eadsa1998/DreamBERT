I am in a large room, sort of like a gym with furniture. Merle and I are exercising. I am standing and doing stretches. One leg up and then the other and stretching every part of me. It felt wonderful. I tease Merle and tickle him on his round tummy. Now we are moving furniture, a yellow couch. Ginny helps. I pin some yellow sheets of paper up on a side wall of a stage area that is not accessible to wheelchairs. I walk, so it's no problem for me. Someone takes them down and I say, "Hey, put them back! I put them there so people can write on them. I am expecting lots of school kids to come." He says, "But it seems there are better places for this." I say, "I looked. This is the best place." Then I look around again and realize that the main gym wall is accessible and all I would have to do is move the kid's pictures displayed there up here on the side stage wall and use that space. I go to the man and say, "You were right. There is a better place." I go down to do that. I see a huge map of the world on the wall, and later I see it's gone. Now the kids are arriving. I see someone has taken something of mine and I complain, but what shall I do about the pain? I look and I see two Alka Seltzer pills and a small pill. I tell Ginny that these are mine, for the pain. Ginny is busting two kid girls for having drugs. She is lecturing them. [BL]
