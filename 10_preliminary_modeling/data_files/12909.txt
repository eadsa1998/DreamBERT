Clark Kent and Lex (both from Smallville) were somewhere. Sometimes it was me. This girl could morph into people. She turned into Autumn. The episode went for 60 minutes because it was a "choose your own" ending. Clark got trapped through glass in his face. He said something to Lex about glass. It was then real life and Chloe (Smallville) was complaining about the soil.
