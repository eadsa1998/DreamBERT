I was sitting on the roof drawing trapezoids and parallelograms. Actually they were rectangles but with the vanishing points and points of view, the perspective and the way the sun was shining; therefore trapezoids. On the roof was a ??? I thought, "I sure could use $3000.00 CASH, so I'll just go over there and shingle that guy's roof." So I went over there and I looked at the roof. It was a simple inverted 'V' roof with a small protrusion in the back (which) I assumed was a bathroom.. The shingles were black like very, very coarse sandpaper. They were hand-broken in asymmetrical arbitrary shapes. There was a empty coffee can filled with glue (mixed with water) and I didn't put enough glue on the ceiling and they [the broken shingles] all fell on my head. Then I got the glue working and finished the back half. Then I was over halfway done with the front half. "I don't believe I'm going to pay you $3000.00 after all. And I said, "Well then I'm not finishing your roof and I'm gonna scrape off every shingle on your roof AND I'M NOT going to give you piano lessons. He said, "350% of magazine writers said I should take piano lessons." And I said, "I don't have enough time for myself to play. There must be 15 people who asked me to teach them piano lessons."
