A strange place where a coworker I don't like came up, kissed me and asked to marry me. In the dream I was dating her for sometime now and I said yes. Also I owned the place I now work at and had to fire her because she was lazy. If I didn't the main headquarters would fire me. Next, it jumped to me marrying her and I woke up.
