I was walking on the street clad only in the pants part of a pajamas. A policeman stopped me and asked me who I was. I disguised my voice and spoke with a Puerto Rican accent. I said I am a Puerto Rican. He asked me why I was not dressed, and I replied, "I go now to get my clothes in my house." I had no house to go to, but I went to a house. A woman about 60 answered. I asked her if she could give me some clothing and she did.
