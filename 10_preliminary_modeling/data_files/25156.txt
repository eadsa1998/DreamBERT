 I'm in downtown Wilmerton. I'm climbing on top of the buildings. On the north side of Downtown Street, I climb over all the buildings. I am going to climb on the buildings on the south side too. I am with someone, who may be my friend Stephen Ramos or Tim Zelling. We go around the side of the bank on the corner of the block. In back there are a bunch of fire-escape-like ladders. A man in green is up on one of the ladders. We can't go up the ladders because there is a dispute occurring on a hill nearby. A group of men are arguing or harassing some people. A black man shoots a woman. I scramble for cover, but make sure I can see to tell police what I saw. I run and hide. My roommate Jens Nils and his friend hide too. They are riding bicycles. Jens tells me of something that just happened. I tell him of this shooting, of the racist aspect of it. <br/
