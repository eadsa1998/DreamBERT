I was alone in a room which was quite unfamiliar to me. In this room I was only cognizant of one window with a shade over it. The setting of the room was of no importance to me when I was dreaming. I was standing on something in order to fasten the shade which seemed to be failing down, i.e., rolling up from the top to the bottom. The shade was trapezoid in shape. The smaller base was on the top and it was the part which I was continually trying to fasten. There is a break in my memory at this point for the next thing I remember is that I unfastened the shade at the top and inserted a light built into a light socket. The position of the light socket was under the shade, but I don't remember seeing it.
