I am in some public place, reminds me of the grocery store in another dream, or lots of airports - there is food involved, and for some reason or other people are eating in the restroom. (This isn't normal.) I'm sitting at the mirror-counter next to a man, and am very ill at ease about it. There's no actual reason for it, it's entirely the principle of the thing.
