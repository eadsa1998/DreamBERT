I am changing in a stall, like the open kind at some beaches. There is a local girl outside; the kind of "regular" person I associate with being a local. Not college educated, works a low-level service job, like retail at a big box store or waitress. She starts talking to me over the top of the stall. I am here working on something, a story for the newspaper. We hit it off well talking. She has curly brunette hair, and is attractive. She is wearing jean shorts. She comes into the stall and we press against each other. We begin to kiss and undress.
