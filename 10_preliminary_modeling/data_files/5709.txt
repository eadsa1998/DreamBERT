[1997-05-18] I dreamed I was riding on a bus, thinking we were on the same route that my brother had taken me to get to his boat along a river and we were going around a sharp curve and almost overturned. Also dreamed of being in my attic, moving around up there then trying to find my way back to the steps that come down from the attic. Also dreamt about going up in an elevator, trying to get up to someone's apartment and feeling the elevator for Braille and finding, no I was feeling for room numbers and finding several room numbers on each plaque instead of just one and was confused and didn't know where to go.
