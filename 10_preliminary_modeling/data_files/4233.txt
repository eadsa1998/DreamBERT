["Anger and sex."] I am angry at some man. We are talking in an adversarial way. Then it shifts and we are kissing. We are embracing and bumping up against walls, flimsy plywood like walls. A part of me hopes we aren't being so noisy that we wake the kids in the next room, but the desire is intense and we make wild passionate love. I am all over him, moving toward that climax. It feels great. Then I have orgasm. His hair is soft. I feel good about him and loved the sex.
