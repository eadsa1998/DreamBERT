Suddenly I was in a room of my house which had turned into a bathroom. I was there with only a robe on, preparing a bath for myself, when a rather old guy came in (I had seen him at dinner that night) and he tried to rape me. I put up a fight and got out of the room. I wanted a different bathroom. When I got out, I looked both ways to make sure there wasn't anybody there, but I didn't realize I was in the dining room and that everybody was eating there. It was a strange hour -- it was at night and yet there was light. I felt desperate and ran. I found myself running with my grandmother through some very steep streets around where she lives, but they were too steep and I didn't dare to go on. My grandmother left and I was alone. But then a cousin of about my age came to accompany me and I talked to him and he took my hand because I was afraid to go on and fall down. Talking, he told me that my grandfather on my father's side was a degenerate and that his own son-in-law said this. I was scared, but it was no longer him who was with me, but another cousin, and I was afraid, surprised and ashamed because my grandfather was a homosexual. All the people and places in the dream are familiar. The people are either friends or relatives of mine. before going to bed, I went out to eat and coming back, I passed by Arequipa Ave. where I saw the homosexuals.
