I went to the shop and I was only wearing a bra and shorts. I was looking at the men's clothes but there wasn't much there. I asked Mom to get something to call with. Ezra was there too. We got to the checkout and I went to the female section. A girl suggested this boy hair style packet and it took 37 minutes but I couldn't find it. Someone she knew kept singing this 'old' song. I saw Dad at one point and he lifted me up.
