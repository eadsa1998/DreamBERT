I had several fragments of dreams that seemed sort of interesting. In the first dream, Bill H. had just finished giving me a test of some sort. It wasn't very much like the Rorschach he actually gave me last night, because it consisted of seeing or talking about all these real little people and things. But after we had finished with the test, or as the very last part of the test, he was taking a shower and I was supposed to watch him and then take one myself, or sort of take one with him. And this seemed significant when I woke up from it.
