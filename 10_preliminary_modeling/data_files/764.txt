I was to teach a class in cooking. I had a sack full of papers, food stuffs, etc. I went to the office to see if I could make some schedule changes at the last minute but no dice. Sherrie said the recipe sounded good. She'd like a taste. She walked down to the classroom with me, Room 319. The same guy named Dave was teaching the same kind of class in the next room. I couldn't find my recipe card. I looked and looked. No students showed up. I suddenly remembered that I was to teach a laundry class next hour and I was not prepared at all. As I started cooking the meat, Eve called with list of names for a later club meeting. Sherrie was getting impatient. I felt incompetent. I then see the recipe card floating in a room of water. It is all soggy. I turn the meat over, and burn the card that was stuck in the oven door. I thought, "I must restructure the furniture in the room as I can't get around well," (previous dream snatches, Tony and Nancy W. A guy like Dwight.)
