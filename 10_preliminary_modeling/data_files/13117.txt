I saw Tinkerbell in the games room. Tigger was there too. I said hello to Tinkerbell and gave her a pat. Then I 'woke' up. I was crying. I was at school. Ms Pascal was around and she walked off. Mr Reilly was doing something about leaves. These black people had balls and were throwing them at us. We threw them back. We were joking about Evelyn and Darius. I threw a water bottle and it went over three of them. One was white with really brown eyes. Someone opened this door and there was a time 'vortex'. They closed it. The black people went to sleep. We went through the vortex and landed in a wrestling match.
