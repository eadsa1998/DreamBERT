I am at a baseball game, wearing blue jeans and a plaid shirt.  I'm not playing in the game.  Whoever our catcher is (short and blond), he sure can fire a peg to second base.  I happened to notice that our third base coach looks remarkably like Grandpa, and I comment on this to the boy beside me.  I look at the coach's leg, and sure enough he has a wooden leg.  There are runners on first and third, and on the next pitch our catcher steps across the plate as if to throw to second.  We all think it is just a bluff.  But then, seeing the runner decide not to go to second, he makes a weak throw to first, which doesn't get there.  The runner coming in from third stops about 3 feet from home and watches the ball bounce a ways past the first baseman and doesn't continue until it is retrieved.  When it is, the first baseman's throw to the plate is high.  I make an instinctive lunge for it, but stop.
