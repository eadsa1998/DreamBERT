I was roaming about in a ravine which was quite similar to the one that surrounded the junior high school I once attended. I think that I actually had the feeling that it was the same one, but at the same time, it seemed to be near Reserve. Then I was in a classroom, I think a history classroom, with a teacher lecturing whom I had heard of but never met. He was about 30 years old and quite personable. At the same time that he was lecturing, the boy in back of me was approximately my own age, was brushing his hair and this seemed very natural at the time. I also remember noticing a blond girl sitting to the front and right of me who was said to be very attractive, but whose face I could not see.
