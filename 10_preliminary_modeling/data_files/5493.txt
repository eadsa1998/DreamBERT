I was playing an organ at a funeral and I thought it went very well, but apparently someone was very unhappy about it because a man, and I have no idea who the man was, left the funeral home with me and we walked along a very deserted road, and it was bitterly cold. I had on my woolen winter coat which goes below mid-calf and its a very comfortable coat, but its awkward and heavy. And the wind was blowing and it was raining all of a sudden the man with me said "Run P! That car is chasing us!" We began to run, and it was very difficult for me in that coat and I tripped and stumbled, I didn't fall and the man grabbed my arm and pushed me up against a tree. He said, "stand there with your back to the road and he won't be able to see us." And it was very, very dark and the headlights of the car kept coming closer and closer and I woke up terrified and shaking like a leaf.
