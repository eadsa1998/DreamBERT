Father Andrew dies suddenly: terrible shock; I am with Marissa and Patio (their daughter); I comfort her. They come to our house and then we visit them at their house. Marissa is in shock; see white sheets, nurses, bottles.... I give her my brown beads (square wooden beads) to say the JESUS Prayer; she smiles.
