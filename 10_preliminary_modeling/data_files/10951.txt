I dreamt I was making snowflake decorations for a party. Some boys were helping me, about my age, then they all left and I had to finish all the work myself. They (boys) went outside and played around in the snow, then started throwing snowballs at me. Then the dream shifted to another scene. I was going to visit my father who was put in prison, although he was innocent of the charge. I do not remember what the charge was, but I felt terrible about it and wanted to get him out. My older brother also came to see him, and told me he did not think there was a hope of setting Dad free.
