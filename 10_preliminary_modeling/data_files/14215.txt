We were getting takeaway for dinner. At around 2pm, Mom went to get it. I was watching a movie and doing stuff and got distracted. At 9pm I went out to see what was going on. Darren called her a cheat. She hadn't been back and no-one could get hold of her. I called her and on the second time she answered. She said her car had broken down. Later I was with her and she continued saying it was because her car had broken down, but she was acting nervous like. There were four really bright stars in the sky and I was trying to take a photo.
