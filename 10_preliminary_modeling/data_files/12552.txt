I was at school and it was night. I was like 'What the hell am I doing here?' and then I remembered what was happing. I got out and then went to find Mom. I called her and she said that she was in the school in a room somewhere, but it didn't have a number on the door. I found one and went in. Poppa and some guy from school were in there. We found Mom and then got caught. We got put in this room which had beds all around the outside, and all in the middle. One of the beds at the end had space for two more people so I went there. Samantha was there, but at the other end. I was looking for Dmitri but he wasn't there.
