 I'm looking at photographs. One is called "Holy Mary" and it is of a half naked woman who might be dead. There is a hand, actually a thumb, in the picture, over her underwear, like there is some sexual element about it. There is a photograph of me last summer with long hair that is slicked back. In the picture I am tan. There is also a photograph of me with a kid that I baby-sat down at the local park catching frogs. In the photograph, I am 18 or 19 years old. But, the pond at that park was filled in several years before I turned 18.
