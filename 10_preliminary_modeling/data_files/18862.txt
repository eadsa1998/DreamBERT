I'm walking down a snowy road in Vermont asking myself how snow got into Florida. I realize I'm going in the opposite direction of the town and must turn back, feeling compensated in that this is going downhill. I stop at a general store and ask for a drink. A man tells a boy to pour me a whiskey. He continued to unpack boxes. I shift my feet and he pours the whiskey.
