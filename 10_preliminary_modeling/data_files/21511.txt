Bob and I were walking on St. Claire. I thought I saw a wrist watch on the curb; sure enough, I picked it up and put it on my wrist. When we got home, I looked at it and listened to it run. It turned into a radio and when it ran, it moved on a track and there came a set of pottery jars with it. Also a long chain with it, and then it also squirted water and sort of shot flashes and made a noise like a gun. I seemed to be fighting with someone. I got hold of my penis and it came off my body. I held it in my hand like a cigar and also I was going to look thru it like a telescope.
