["Sweet Love And Howard's Heart"]  I am with Al Pacino.  He loves me and wants us to be together. I finally agree and we sweetly make love. I hold his face in my hands and love him. We are both happy. Later, Al is sort of Howard. I feel surprised that we made love. I am uncertain if this is  OK. Later, Howard is lying down on the ground. I lay my head on his chest and feel the uneven bulging  pounding of his heart. I am worried. This isn't healthy. Howard could die. Later I see a cat like Fluffy standing on her tiptoes on her hind legs carrying a small purse. I think she looks cute. There is some distance now between Howard and me.
