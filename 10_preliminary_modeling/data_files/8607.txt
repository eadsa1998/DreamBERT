I was working on an Excel spreadsheet that seemed to be divided into three sections. I used the spreadsheet to work with internet urls and they had something to do with the TV program American Idol. I was working with producers and/or the host of the program. It seems that each url had a question associated with it and they were being used somehow with or by the participants in the competition. We were testing them. but not by clicking on the urls. We may have been asking some of the questions. And we were doing an overall evaluation of what we had so far. Was it too many? Were they the right ones? Were people able to use them and understand? Some involvement by or with the competitors helped us to see that there were too many and that some were not clear. So we began editing and deciding which ones to eliminate and which ones needed to be changed for clarification. We began making changes to some of the questions and eliminating some of them. At this point I think maybe at least one of the judges, Simon, became involved. There was discussion about a favorite charity of each of the judges. Simon had started a charity called Hard Hats for Kids. I thought it was such a great name. It fit the charity so well. It was metaphorical but I can't remember what it was a metaphor for. I may have been awake at this point, but I'm not sure, as I tried to figure out the metaphor. The main one I remember is thinking that it had something to do with children building their future. There were few images besides the boxes of the spreadsheet and the text in those boxes. There is a very distant, unclear image of the program host.
