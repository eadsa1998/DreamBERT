 Something happens with a game castle. My grade school schoolmate Karen Kipp and her three sisters are there. My friend Stephen Ramos is there eating strawberries and ice cream. My sisters Ramona and Heather are back. My mom is gone to the grocery store. We have sour milk, and she may be getting good milk. The fat Hall Advisor from Major Hall is there.
