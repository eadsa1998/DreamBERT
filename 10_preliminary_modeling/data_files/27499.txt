I was in our family car with my father, mother, brother and aunt. We were driving along C__ when I noticed that there was a car stuck in front of us. It turned out to be a friend of mine (the same age as myself) and her husband. We offered to give them a push but their car wouldn't move. Finally my friend began to hitch hike and got a ride on a motorcycle.
