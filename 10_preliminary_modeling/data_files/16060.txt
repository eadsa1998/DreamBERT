Mom and I were driving out to Specs -- I can't remember if Dad was with us or not -- and we had a machine set up in the car, plugged into the fuse panel and drawing 12 volts just like all the other accessories. And Mom and Dad were going in to look at some things at Specs for a while, and I stayed out because I was tired and I wanted to take a nap, and I turned on the ignition and started listening to the radio. And I was listening and listening, and before I knew it, it was starting to sound a little weak, and I thought, "Oh no, here we go." And so I shut it off and tried to start the engine, and it wouldn't start. And I was thinking, "What am I going to tell them? Am I going to tell them I was reading the whole time?" And so I went in and I was looking around with them, and Mom handed me four CDs and said, "Take these up to the counter." Two of them were Christmas orchestra things, one of them was something to do with rap and the other one I couldn't read. And I was thinking to myself, "How am I going to tell them it won't start? Should I just let them discover it or what?" But I woke up before they really tried to start it. [This actually happened when I was in middle school: Mom left me in the car, left the radio on, and promised she'd come back in 5 minutes. But, we both lost track of the time, and she came out a half hour later and couldn't start the car!! I can't tell you how awful I felt that day, it was all my fault!}
