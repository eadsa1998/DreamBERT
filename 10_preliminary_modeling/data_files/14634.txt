I was in Human Bio, but it was different. Felipe was in front of me and Aliyah was next to me. I was in the third row (there were five rows). At the end of the class, Felipe said he wanted to ask Aliyah to a dance but couldn't afford a dancer. Then he said instead of asking the 'pretty girls', he should ask the ugly ones. I thought 'here we go' and he said "Hello", obviously pretending to ask me (and he was being mean, not joking). We got given a new experiment, at first it was already filled out but then it was new. I started going on about everyone being shallow, but he just walked off. Aliyah waited for me in the hall outside and we walked together. She went into a room and then two people were talking. She went behind this bookshelf (which was sticking out in the middle of the room, and there was a hidden space behind it). She sat in this thing in front of the wall and there was a hole behind it. It was small and she went through it as a shortcut out. There was no way I could fit, so I left and went out the front door (the place was like a mansion). There were thin wires all over the lawn (which was huge) and so I was jumping over them. Then there was garden bed and I crawled through it to the path. I realized I had forgotten my shoes. I had to cross the road for the bus and I was thinking I should call Mom to get me.
