I was traveling with my friends and my mom and dad. We traveled to some big house where the emperor lived. These kind of women and guys came and they did something bad to you--to everybody. One day they came to the house and I jumped through the window where the emperor was and he gave me a little hat to protect me. What the people did to you was change your hair a different color and they kept on going every day so I decided to go somewhere else. We came back to the emperor and said, "when is this gonna stop". He said "I don't know".
