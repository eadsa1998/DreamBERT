I was in a place that I didn't know. The oldest brother on the television show, "A Party of Five," was pursuing me. His name is Charlie. He knew I was unhappy in my current relationship and wanted me to leave my boyfriend. I was hesitant because I still loved my boyfriend and I didn't want to leave him to start a new relationship with someone else. There was also a slimy-looking guy who was also pursuing me and I had no interest in him whatsoever. I didn't know how to tell him to back off, so he just kept pestering me. I was running in a race in which I came in second. I felt all right about my performance, but I also thought that I could do better. Right after a race I went into a room to be alone and then the slimy guy followed me into the room and cornered me. That's when Charlie came in and put his arms around me in a protecting way and told the other guy to get lost. Then my boyfriend came in and just when I was going to try to explain what was happening, I woke up, ending the dream with my boyfriend and I standing face to face.
