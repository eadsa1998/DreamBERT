Mrs. Dougherty was at our house, and she was laying in bed at night in the dark on Mom's side of the bed, and there was nobody else in the bed, but we were just kind of there doing our thing. And she was laying there and I was standing, and she wanted to know how my singing technique was presently. So she wanted to sing something and have me sing it back, and have her feel how I do it. And so she sings a couple of notes like in a minor key, and it kind of scared me a little and so I grabbed her hand, but then I was okay and I sang it back to her, and she kind of felt how I breathed and how I did it. And I think she wanted to do it a couple more times, and I think maybe we did. And then I laid next to her like I do with Mom, and she held me like Mom does. And I think that was the end of that.
