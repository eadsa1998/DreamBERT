I was trying to escape, like a runaway orphan.  Women were in pursuit.  Hid behind a tree and someone saw me.  She didn't turn me in and I found it to be Netty from first quarter French.  She was digging behind the airport and had been through it before, so she was sympathetic and gave me a suggestion, which I took.
