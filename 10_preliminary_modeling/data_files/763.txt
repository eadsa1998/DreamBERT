A bar. I went in. Several guys, musicians. I sat at their table. An older guy (like cook Dave) was telling stories. He mentioned the Quadriplegic Rodeo. I watched a "cat" that bumped into a jukebox (see drawing) that turned into a man on top and a woman on bottom. I walked through the bar stepping up on tables and chairs rather than going around them. Before that I had been riding a large deer with antlers. He was kind of wild and I kept thinking he'd turn on me.
