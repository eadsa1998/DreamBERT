I attended the American Idol finale at the State Fairgrounds in my home state. Taylor Hicks won. I was walking to my car but felt lost. I wasn't sure which way I had come in. I was standing near a gate that I thought was where I came in. I took a few steps forward leaning to my right to look but then would step back again because I wasn't sure. I did this several times. In between I would look around to see if something else looked more familiar. Taylor walked up and asked me if something was wrong. I told him that I wasn't sure if this is where I came in. He said he was going to walk with me, to make sure I found my car okay. I thanked him for being so kind but also said I didn't want to bother him - especially tonight of all nights. He had much more important things to do, and family and friends who were waiting on him. He insisted on staying with me until I found my car. There were 2 or 3 people with him. We walked several places but nothing seemed to be right, even to him. He decided that we would walk to their car and then drive around until we found my car. I was so amazed that he was being so nice.
