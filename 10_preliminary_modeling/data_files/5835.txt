Dreamt that we were in this old store and there were no elevators. There were old stairs, winding stairs to go to different levels in the store. All the floors were wood and the stairs were rickety and very very steep. I could feel the shakiness and hear them creaking. I knew if anyone fell it would be dangerous because the stairs were very onerous. I went down into what seemed like a sub basement, the railings were rough and loose, and there was a lady there who used to help us her name was V. She was with me in the dream, helping us as she always did. It seemed that we looked at a lot of clothes, a lot of different things. I'm thinking that it might have been an old Sears store, of yesteryear. Nothing looked new. The clothes were on these racks that felt wooden, everything was an old style store. And then we walked up and out and when we got up these winding stairs on the street level, the dream just faded away...I don't remember buying anything. It seemed we were there for a very long time. Mary was there and those ominous stairs.
