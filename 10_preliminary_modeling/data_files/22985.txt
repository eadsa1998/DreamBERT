My wife Bonita and I were on a ship, maybe The President, when an emergency arose similar to that in a previous dream, possibly also a fire.  As before, we suspected that something was wrong some time before the official notification.  Water was almost to the edge of the decks when the order came over the PA system:  "Lower the lifeboats, Congressmen."  I didn't know whether that meant they were supposed to do the work or to be the first ones aboard.  I assumed the latter, which sort of irritated me.  Actually, though, everyone pitched in to lower them, and children were the first ones put aboard.  The lifeboats were very small -- not much bigger than a bathtub -- and it took so long to lower them that I began trying to figure out what we should do if we found ourselves in the water.  I had a hand in lowering one boat.  It was actually pulled by a rope along a sort of wire frame or net along the side of the boat until it got to the desired location.  A young girl or boy got it started, to my left, and I passed it on to a group of women and children to my right.  <p
