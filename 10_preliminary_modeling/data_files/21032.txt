I was in the screw dept. and it was dark in there. There was something the matter with the switch. Louie gave me a saucer of hot water to hold and he forced the switch. I went over to the machines and some women were running them and #27 was moved. There was a dog tied to a chain. I took the chain and put it on nails around a barn. There was a scene as the end of the world. The earth crumbled and people disappeared into it screaming. We went on top of a mountain. I looked into the sky and saw a Technicolor picture of a man killing his two brothers with a dagger. Then I saw kings kissing young girls, teenagers. A policeman bawled me out for not driving right around the turn. He showed me I should drive about 3 ft. from the curb going around the curb. Grandpa said he had his will made out.
