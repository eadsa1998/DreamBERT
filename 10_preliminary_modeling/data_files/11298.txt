I was playing 3rd base in a baseball game on a strange field and with teammates who were unknown to me. I was moving in close on a batter when he smashed a hard hit ball to my right. I felt that it was vitally important for me to get the ball and yet I could not move. It seemed that I was rooted to the spot.
