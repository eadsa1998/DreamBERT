 People are in front of my truck, pushing back against it as I try to drive. The people include my friends Stephen Ramos, Kevin Simpson, Lyle Zeffman, and Marybeth Neumann. I try to drive, but the truck won't move forward. I am furious! I get out of the truck and promptly throw a punch at Stephen, which grazes his chin. I don't punch Kevin because I have too much respect for him. I yell at them both furiously! I grab hold of Kevin by the shirt and tell him to leave my truck alone and respect me! Marybeth is in front of the truck. I ask her politely to move the table that is also in front of the truck, so I can drive. She refuses to do so. I pick Marybeth up and put her in another place. I drive, pushing the table as I do. I say that I'd beat up Lyle, who is also in front of the truck, but he's not worth the effort. He lays there feeling insulted and does nothing. Marybeth is annoying. She is acting like a feminist. She calls me a homosexual, which is a name for someone who discriminates against others. I move her and tell her to leave. I say seriously and angrily that I don't ever want to talk to her again. She is trying to coerce Kevin into adopting a child, as if Kevin is the father of it. I am adamantly against this, because it will ruin Kevin's ego.
