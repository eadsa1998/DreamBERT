 I'm with a group of people, including Nat Miller and Yvonne Zellers. We're sitting in someone's living room in a big circle, playing cards. I'm dealing a poker game. I put the jokers on the bottom of the deck. I'm going to cheat and deal them to me. We must be playing Baseball because 3's and 9's are wild. I have this horrible tasting stuff in my mouth; it might be vinegar. We talk about the money used in Britain, pounds. Someone says that the exchange rate is 20 pounds for one US dollar. I have a quarter, so that's five pounds. The cards are dealt. I have a good hand, but we are all just joking around, not playing serious poker. People go to the door to leave. My mom is there, she says goodbye to them. I show them my hand before they go. I have ten 10's, consisting of five natural 10's, two of which are the 10 of spades, three 9's and two 3's. The deck is a mix of all different cards, like I used for playing Canasta as a kid. As they leave, I realize it's New Year's Eve.
