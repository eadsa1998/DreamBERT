I awaken and look out window and note I forgot to put out garbage cans the evening before. Note that trash baskets of neighbor on left are empty, but here and there across the street I note that a can or basket remains full while others are empty. I cannot tell whether garbage men have passed by yet or not and this is annoying. Then I see 3 or 4 full cans sitting on my driveway and remember that I promised the neighbor on the right that I would put them out during their absence. I think about putting them out even now, but am not sure whether it is too late or not.
