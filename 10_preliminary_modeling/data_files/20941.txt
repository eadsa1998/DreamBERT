I was in the dime store and took something out that I didn't pay for. I was seen and was laid for, but they never caught me with the goods. I was there with Ann and children. I bought a couple of midget autos for him. I saw a toy train on the way home. Dark clouds were coming and I got on the streetcar to get home
