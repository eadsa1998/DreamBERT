Mom was pregnant and went to get an abortion. I told her to roll the car after getting 3 random numbers. I also used a syringe to take a small amount of fluid. After rolling the car, we stopped in at a drive thru place. This guy said we didn't have to do the car roll. Ezra was in a shop and he came out and asked if they did anything to her and she said no, that she did it herself and he said 'I'm so stupid' as he had told the checkout girls and they weren't allowed to say anything for a certain number of days. On Facebook, Ezra sent a private messaging saying that a friend of mine had sent him pictures of me drunk and I said 'I've never been drunk, or drank alcohol -- it's not me!'.
