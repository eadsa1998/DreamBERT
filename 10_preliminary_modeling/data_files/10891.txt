I dreamed that for some reason I was confined in the big brown house behind our lot. I was free to come and go as I pleased within the house, but I could not leave. The interior of the house was beautifully done in pale marble. There were no separate rooms, but it was divided into separate compartments by walls which protruded from the side walls at various angles. Straw mats were on the floor, and the large, short, fat man who kept me from leaving was always watching me. A wonderful man (the boy I am engaged to) kept coming to see me very often and begging me to come away from the place with him. I wanted to very much, but the fat man would not let us. One morning a group of school children, about 7 years old, were being led by the fat man in a tour of the building. We followed them, hiding behind the marble walls until we managed to escape. It felt so wonderful to be outside in the sunshine again.
