My family and I were having dinner with my godmother's family the Swensons at a restaurant.  Every time someone would come up the stairs, the longhaired black cat would urinate.  We complained.  They didn't listen until I called it a health hazard.  My mother mentioned the clean state of the room the Swenson boys slept in.  Their mom, of course, was not satisfied.  My brother Stuart and I picked up from the table many desserts to share.  Some silly stuff in getting up.  I was in a tutu and tried to play it off with stretching.  Then I was outside a house on a street waiting to be picked up.  People were walking by, including Kevin from core and one of his friends.  They were in karate garb, both black belts, and I was surprised that they would have that sort of discipline.  They took a bunch of planks I had and spread them to practice with as a bokken.  Their skill was fairly impressive.  There was some sort of encounter and I no longer doubted their rank.  They did not hesitate and had their skills on hand, even if it wasn't very quick or strong.
