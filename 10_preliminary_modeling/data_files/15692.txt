I had another job that I went to two times a week. There was a small platform for the tube with only one carriage door. It was always late. I got to the place where the office was and Howard was there and said 'you're here early' or something and was wearing his Pink Floyd shirt and I said 'I have the day off' and he said that he had a 'job interview for the first time in years' and he walked into McDonald's and I went up the escalator. I went to eat and asked for this salad but the lady said I should get the chicken because it's healthier and it was like Â£9.80, but I said ok. I ate it quickly and then ran to the office and was like 15 minutes late. I signed in and someone asked me when I got there and they said 'you should've been here early, you missed [some amusing incident]'. I said the tube was always late and he said that he knew. It was a place where they made all these inventions. One was a scent detecting lock. Another had a cupboard that looked like it had shadows on it, but it opened to nothing except shadows (I think it had something to do with invisibility). I sat at my desk. Each desk had a curtain that could be pulled 3/4 the way around. I had a pink rabbit vibrator in my drawer and I put it in my bag to take away. I got up for a bit and later it was gone, as well as some other stuff. Someone had put a bunch of stuff in a fridge/freeze and it was in there. I quickly took it before anyone saw. There were also a few other things in there. The girl that had done it was sleeping and I wondered if she had been sleepwalking.
