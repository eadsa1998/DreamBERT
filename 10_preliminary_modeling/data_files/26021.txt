 I'm in a big city. There is a very tall hotel with many stories. Off the side of the hotel quite high up is a platform that extends 25 or 30 out from the building. It is all enclosed and finished off. This is Alcatraz. The platform has a satellite dish on it, pointing upwards. It sends out small waves and gets the waves back when they are larger. The platform ledge is used for high-class business or social functions. In the building there is a large round elevator with a hole in the middle: donut shaped. People stand where the cake part of the donut would be. The elevator is about 70 feet in diameter and holds a couple hundred people. It goes up and down many floors of the building very fast, but gently. <br/
