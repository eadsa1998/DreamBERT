My room adjoining R's family. Some trouble about radiator. I object to her children coming into my room without knocking. Told C. (R's husband) how my present landlady does not knock and came in twice finding me stripped. Large hole in floor in entrance between rooms and man working there. Am told R. has a newborn son. Eliz has named him babe of Bethlehem. Go to see child. He has red gold hair. Very strong. Starts to sit alone. Grows bigger and stronger and asks for food. I protest it can't be so strong a child. This must be a dream, but it seems very real and insists it is not a dream. Ask R. what she is doing out of bed. Discussed whether I had noted her condition. See as if remembered her father stout, walking outdoors with C. Ask if she if she is going to call child some other name. Say initials B.O.B. people will think surname is O'Brien...Deserted banquet hall. See chocolate dolls. Start to eat one. Find its hair is spun chocolate. Before all eaten, other people enter. Secretary to Univ. club among them. More food on tables. She tells us to take some. I eat crumbly tart, cookie and wrap up in paper parts of two cakes. Feel heat and keep adding papers to preserve hands. The room is large with very long windows, takes up large part of a stone University building.
