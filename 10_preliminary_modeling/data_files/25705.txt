 I'm arriving at a retreat house with my dad and his wife Lisa Lawson. I get out of the car after we drive around to the back of the house. I take my fishing gear, my new rod, bucket of minnows, a cup of worms, and my friend Kevin Simpson's bow. I don't shoot the deer we see when we're in the house. I see a doe and a fawn. One or both of the deer vomit and bleed. They collapse on the floor of the house. I easily hold the deer in one hand. There are many floors on the house. I find a room with some broken glass in it. It is AIDSGlass on the glass. I get a lot of tiny pieces of glass on my arm. I brush them off carefully, not wanting to cut myself and contract AIDS. I then wipe my arm off with a cloth. I find a small blue Java backpack, the one that my brother Wally left at home for me. I thought it would be bigger. It says "Java" on the label. I was looking for the cause of the dead deer.
