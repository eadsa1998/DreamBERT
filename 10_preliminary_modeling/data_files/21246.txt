Audrey, Bob and I were climbing up a stairway up a mountain. We heard a noise and wanted to investigate. We finally came to a library. Nuns were taking care of it. I looked out into the mountains. We were on top of one ridge. I was looking into a magazine. I saw pictures of a pugilist. He had on a striped suit and his nostrils were large. I was in the house. Barbara had an artificial breast of a woman stuck on a cellophane paper. The wind blew hard and blew the nipple inside out and it was sticking inside the house. Barbara got frightened and ran away from the window. Grandma Evans got hold of the cellophane paper and ripped it off the window, leaving a hole where the cellophane was. Bob and I were watching traffic. We sat near the road and a fellow on a motorcycle almost ran over us. We moved further back from the road.
