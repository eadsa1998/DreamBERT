Lucy and I are looking at rows upon rows of pianos. I play a few. One has books for keys. I play a tune. Lucy is impressed. I say, "I made it up, on the spot." Then I ask her if she's got some of her eyesight back. She says yes and has a weird-looking eyeglass on. She says, "Some of it is back." Then she goes to sit by the ocean. I put a newspaper around my upper leg and come to her saying, "I want you to see something." She looks. I am wearing the newspaper her father put out and it is too small. The seam is splitting. She gets the message that she has outgrown her father's words and beliefs. I go back to my spot to take a nap, thinking I'd like to be by the ocean too.
