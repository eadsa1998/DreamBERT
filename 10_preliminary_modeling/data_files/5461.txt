Last night I had a very vivid series of dreams. First, I was talking to Keegan in what seemed to be his house. He was waiting for baseball practice and I was waiting for some other athletic event in the field house as well. We were just talking and it was fun! Then he said he wanted to introduce me to his mother, but since we had only met this semester, I figured he was just being friendly. Still, I was flattered and excited. But then I think we had to drive to the field house because his practice was starting soon. We drove over there and then that was the end of that. Then I was in my high school dining hall with Alondra and some random freshmen from college. I was trying to explain why this new painting called "Emily Combusted" was so important and innovative. It was on the front page of the New York Time Arts section. I was talking about how it was part of this new movement called "ir-realism," which is a post-modern sort of surrealism, a style of painting that encompassed the subconscious and wanted to investigate its inner workings, but did so in a more politically self-conscious way. The exhibition that was being reviewed in the Times comprised some hundred paintings that were like Dali paintings looked at through a microscope far away. The details were incredible, the anguish on Emily's face so powerful. It was new and fun and exciting seeing this art in the paper. <br/
