I was in a house I lived in. I picked up a book and some photos and papers with prayers printed on them fell out of it. As I was picking them up, I heard my mother talking outside with my sister. I was relieved to hear their voices. A sudden fear came upon me that the next time my mother left, something would prevent her from returning.
