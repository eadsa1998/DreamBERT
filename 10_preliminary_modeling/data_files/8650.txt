I'm at a store and a clerk is trying to help me with something. Some man comes up. It almost seems like Don H the sportscaster. He wants to buy a copy of Bill C's book. He gets frustrated waiting for this clerk to finish helping me. I finally tell him that I will just give him a copy of the book. I tell him that I work for the author. I apologize that he is having to wait because of me. I suggest that he just take the book and tell him that I will give the store another copy to replace it. That way he doesn't have to wait and he doesn't have to worry about paying for it. Then he took the book back and we were going to go to my car and I was going to get him a copy out of my car. We went out to the parking lot. First I was having trouble finding my car. It didn't seem to be parked where I thought it was. We were walking around. I was getting upset because I felt bad for him that I was making him wait even longer, again, now. I finally saw it right where it was supposed to be. I opened my trunk. No. Maybe it was one of those storage pockets that some cars have in the back seat. on the back of the front seats. There were a bunch of papers and stuff in there. I was looking in those thinking that I had a copy of the book in there. I may have looked in the trunk also. I didn't have one. Then I felt really bad. I went back out to the parking lot later with Bill F.
