I was at school and in the Intro Calc classroom. We had to run out of the class at random times. I changed seats and was next to Eugene, by accident. The seat was the desk behind Autumn's usual seat. We had a test of how we'd survive in certain situations. My scenario was a jumper which was 101.3Â°C. Later, I was walking behind Eugene and Bradley and I or someone said something and Bradley laughed. Darius was there. I or someone passed out.
