I was working in the darkroom. Jasmine had brought a pack of her own paper because the budget guy was breathing down her neck. I had some kind of surgery. Jasmine was letting me recuperate in the darkroom. I was resting. People from class came to see me while I was sitting on the floor resting. It was time for the darkroom to close. A guy was trying to push in the windows while I was trying to lock them. He was trying to push his bicycle through the partly opened vertical window. He wanted to keep it there overnight. He didn't have a place anymore, he said. At the poolside Valerie Snyder was in a lounge chair. Next to her mother. The mother was brushing her hair. It was raining. I was running. I ran to the Empire State Building, because Saturdays between 10:00 and 12:00 they let people run up the steps. On the 32nd floor I met a woman with a baby stroller. And 2 children. They were looking for a bathroom. They knew they'd found it when the mother spotted a Burger King. There was a sign on the wall that said: COOKIES. This is where the bathroom was. (From memory, not on drawing) I was in a new class, a new semester. Jasmine was the teacher. She was making seating arrangements for the year. There were a few too many people for the class, so 3 of us, as our names came up in alphabetical order, were assigned seats across the street from the class. It was a construction site, with columns holding nothing up. And a big hole in the ground. Jasmine decided we couldn't see, so she was re-arranging the seating. While we waited, I had to run on a track, catch up and pass Stephanie Walters.
