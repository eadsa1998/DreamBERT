I was at My school and it was snowing. We were having our futures bowl that day, but no one knew about it. My team came really late, and we only had 15 minutes left. After the futures bowl, my friend Bobbie and I went up to the middle school. They had a really weird swing and we went on it. Setting: At My school. Characters: There were people in my dream. I know most of them (my team, and Bobbie). Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, angry. I was angry that I missed the futures bowl, but I was happy that I got to go on the swing.
