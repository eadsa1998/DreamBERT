["Friendly guests."] I am organizing my stuff in a house. Guests arrive, a woman and four men. One man in particular is very attractive. We are attracted to each other. They are helping me a bit. They are friendly. I am trying to find places for them to sleep, taking them from room to room. I suggest a couch in the living room that folds out for several. I walk through several pretty bathrooms. I notice how nice they look, decorative.
