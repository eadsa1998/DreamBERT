In this dream, I dreamt that I was playing on the Celtics. I was 12th man on the team. I hadn't played all season until this game. All of the Celtics guards got injured in the game and there was nobody else to put in the game except for me. I went in with the game being tied with only 20 seconds left and our ball. Coach Ford set a play up for McHale but I took the ball myself and took a 15-footer from the top of the key and hit it to win the game. The crowd went wild. In the locker room Coach Ford told me I had a lot of guts and heart taking a shot like that and named me the staring point guard for the next season.
