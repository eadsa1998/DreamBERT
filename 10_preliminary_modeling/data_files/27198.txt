I dreamed I was at a dance with a friend. It was rather dark and there were many people there. As we were dancing, this friend I suddenly started to cry. I got disgusted &amp; said to him. "If you are going to act like an eight-year old, I don't want to have anything to do with you." We left the dance floor. He was still feeling bad &amp; made some remark about being emotional. I was disgusted with him because I thought that he was just putting on an act - that he really wasn't emotional but wanted to be.
