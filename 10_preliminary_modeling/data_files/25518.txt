 I'm at a Yankees baseball game. They win 10-4. I am out near right field as the game ends. Fans charge the field, which seems odd to me because I thought it was just another baseball game. I leave, and as I do I swear. A man and his little boy walk by. I feel bad for swearing in front of the boy. I walk down stairs to the parking lot and I see my old neighbor Anna Gates. I have roller-skates on. Anna grabs my shirt with one hand in the chest area. I almost fall back off a ledge, but she pulls me back. We're outside in the parking lot. I skate a little bit while she walks.
