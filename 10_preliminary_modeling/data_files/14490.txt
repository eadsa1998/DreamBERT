I remembered this movie, but I couldn't remember its name. I had remembered about it because I found paintings of it on my computer and the stuff had happened to me. It was Asian like. I was walking with guys from Prison Break and Michael Scofield was walking next to me. I was thinking how T-Bag and Bellick were the most dreamt about from Prison Break. Anyway, I think the movie had Bellick in it and Willem Defoe. I found it on the net, but I now can't remember what it was called but it was from 2000. I went to a shop where I had first found the movie. In the movie, there were people in cars and there was a spooky thing happening outside. One scene had a car in the water and there were electric wires sparking in it. At the shop, I found a little shop -- the aisles were squishy and they all leant on each other. There was a squeaky thing. There was a girl with downs syndrome and she kept doing a kick in the air. I got out and I had a call from Darren saying that Mom had left town, which meant she was borrowing a car off Poppa. I asked if he could pick me up -- I was at Meadowbrook. He was on a motorbike. I was going through my phone and I had Eugene's number and I accidentally dialed it, but quickly hung up.
