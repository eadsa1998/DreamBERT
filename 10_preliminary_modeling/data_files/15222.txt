I was at a park with Dad. There were horses around. It was in the UK. Then Ezra was there too. We were on holidays. Ezra was staying there for study. He dropped us off at school. It looked cold but it was hot. I went back to the hotel and I went inside where the staircase was. There was some event on next to it. There was a queue to get in. There was a table for food and I grabbed a lamington and a brownie. Dad went up the stairs while I was doing that but then the guy wouldn't let me through and I said that my Dad had just gone through and he asked if I had proof and I said no. He asked 'what about your Mom?' and she came and they let me go through. I was like 'I'm 19!'.
