A man grabs me and tries to rape me. I get away. It's time to sleep. I think I'll curl up in a box and then I'll know I'll be protected, but it's too small and cramped; I go outside and position people around me so I'll be protected. Dovre is next to me, Juliet, Dylan, and Jock are around me. I try to sleep.
