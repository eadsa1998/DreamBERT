I went to the Cat Haven [going to Cat Haven for induction today]. I was inside and it was quite big and was office/school like. All the people I saw there were women. My induction and first day were on the same day, but I hadn't called to tell them I couldn't make it. I found the main lady and I told her that I could only attend one, and asked some questions too. I felt stupid about asking questions. I was then back from it, but I couldn't remember what happened.
