I'm preparing to leave my "husband." I feel afraid that he'll catch me. There are some papers to sign to better my position to be independent. I am afraid to and also driven to do it, a last chance sort of feeling. I grab the papers and sign my name on them and hide them in a pile of letters. Then I rush to mail them thinking, "Even he couldn't get them from the U.S. mail!"
