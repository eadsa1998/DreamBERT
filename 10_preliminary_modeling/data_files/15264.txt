I rewatched The Dark Knight and it was actually good, but completely different. There was a scene where some rocks flew to the ground (it looked like a meteor shower) and it was then real life, and there was a long patch of grass where I was and Mom didn't get it as nice. A building flooded and we had to get out and managed to. But then something was happening everywhere and this guy, who I think was my boyfriend, and I went to dads, which was different, to find stuff to use. We had been told to keep towels and pillows on us and they were hard to carry. I found these pink/red net stockings and put them on. Extra clothes also helped. We couldn't lock the balcony door, but figured it didn't matter and left. It was night. The people next door were having sex. Then it was years later and we were both teaching at the same school. We had two sons and I said "ok, don't listen to us" during an argument. I was annoyed that we had 'normal' kids.
