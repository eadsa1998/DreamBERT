I dreamed I was married to a very tall and fat man, with very hard features, and according to him I was hysterical so he was always doing experiments with me. The house in which we lived was very large with a lot of glass and big rooms with electrical appliances. One day I decided that I would try all those experiments he did on me, on him, to see their results. The results were that we both finished up for good, locked in rooms (separate) so that the doctors would cure us. But the strangest thing about the dream was that I wasn't dreaming this, but rather my sister was telling this story about one of her patients to me. When she finished her story, I met her and she told me that both of the sick people would stay until they were cured.
