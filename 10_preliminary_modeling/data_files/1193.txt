I dreamed that I was expecting my boyfriend back. He'd been in the Navy. A man and a woman (like Hector's parents) came into the kitchen where I was doing the dishes. I was happy to see them. We greeted each other in a Spanish way. It was full of formalities and affection. They and I knew "Harry" was coming in, so they left the room for their bedroom. I had my back to the kitchen door but still "saw" Harry come in behind me. I turned. I was very glad to see him. I walked to him smiling. He was equally glad to see me. As we embraced, a grocery sack with 6 packs of beer that he was holding was between us. He kissed me once, then twice, each time more lingering. He said passionately, "Here, put the beer in the fridge and come here!" My brother Dwight, who had come in behind him, said, "Whoa! I guess I'll go sit in the car." I had been putting the beer into the fridge. I noticed that "Harry" (it was Norman), had written letters and messages to me on the beer cartons. I read one about the president getting him enlisted into the navy. I picked up a little Budweiser and gave it to Dwight and said, "Here. There's a pool room in the next room, turn to the left." He gratefully went in there. As "Harry" and I started to move together to embrace, I heard Dwight thinking about where the light switch was. I went in to assist him. I turned on the light and said, "Is that better?" I turned and saw 3 cats. 2 of them were Darryl's and I thought, "I'm glad I didn't get a kitten since Darryl has 2." I stepped on one orange male cat who meowed meanly and put his claws into my foot. I shook him off and sat next to Darryl. He had a beer carton. It had my name "Barb Sanders," and under it, "Jen." In one corner it said, "Uncle Tom, 1961," referring to a war incident that was potentially dangerous. We chatted.
