I was at school. I don't know what I did for most of the day but at Lunch 2 I did something that prevented me from eating my lunch. Then I remembered I had to do an exam at noon so I quickly started eating my sandwich. Ms Pascal said hello and asked if I was "mighty awesome" and this girl giggled and said to a friend, "Did you hear that? Mighty Awesome!" and they said it was that guy from Chuck (Captain Awesome). I got to the front office, which was different and threw the crust into the bin, but it hit someone's burger on the table and I was thinking they weren't going to like that. I went into the room to do my exam and Ms Solomon and Ms Madsen gave me the questions. Autumn was doing Applicable Maths and the exam too. The first question was "gobble". I got my calculator, ruler and notes out of my bag. The people doing the year book had a secret room with a picture of a girl who was killed by a drugged up guy and was the same guy who killed a guy called Jimmy Edwards [name of character in One Tree Hill, but unrelated]. I was looking at the pictures and there were profile photos of Chris Barrie, Milo Ventimiglia and Martin Sheen. There was a joke about Martin Sheen and him winning lots of rewards. Some guy's restaurant/shop had a back room with books in it. A cop was looking around the shop but ignoring the room. I said "shouldn't you be checking in there?". The guy got worried. There was a problem with the electrical wires and I was crawling on the floor and hit one that was uncovered with my finger and it burnt and left a mark. Dad told me to rub it on the floor and it hurt so he was showing me how hard to press.
