Ezra and I were at an arena. There was a sports announcer guy. It was a movie though? The visiting team looked like they were going to win and I had bet $80 on the home team and I said to Ezra "I know home's going to win, the movie has to have a happy ending". The announcer ended up dying before finding out and everyone called it a tragedy. I was sick somewhere. Mom picked me up. I kind of didn't want to leave. She got me and said "I know you're not pretending". There was also a TV show and Morena Baccarin, Adam Baldwin and Alan Tudyk, who I referred to as just Alan.
