I was going to attend a Little League baseball game with Mrs. Hollander and Mr. Owen and Mrs. Dougherty, and I was taking a bus to school at like 6:30 at night. And I got on the bus and I realized that I didn't have any shoes on, but then I looked down and I saw my sandals, so I put my sandals on. And I got to school and I was walking in the hallway and it was almost dark, and I realized that they were going to not like me wearing my sandals, so I was going to call Mom on the pay phone to bring them and to give me my other shoes. And I just thought about them and they were on my feet and I didn't have to call Mom after all. Later we walked out to the football field and it was real cold and there were several little fires going. And there was one that was almost burned down, and I put my hand in the embers to get a little statue of a parrot out of there, and it didn't burn me at all, it only tingled a little bit so I figured I'd better get away from here before the teacher sees me sticking my hand in the fire. And then, after I pulled the statue of the parrot out, it started burning big again, and Mrs. Hollander and Mrs. Dougherty and I sat down on the bench in front of it to keep us warm, because it was cold. And Mrs. Dougherty's voice was getting lower and lower, and I was really afraid that she had been hurting it yelling at the class, which she never did.
