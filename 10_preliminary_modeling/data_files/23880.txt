Houses - 3 progressions.  Started in one, pretty normal.  Then to a second one, a real tiny house, crammed together with many other tiny houses, barely room to sit up inside.  Leonard G (fire crew boss, we were lovers) was there.  I was comparing it to another tiny house I knew.  There were planks and walkways among the houses, a bad area or poor area.  I really thought about the lifestyle there, how it would be to live there.  Then to the most unusual one.  Feeling of a large weedy back yard, more open space, more isolated.  It was a newer house, and feeling like I had moved on or progressed to live there.  Almost a drug feeling, but not bad.  Like we used drugs in a good, constructive way, to gain talents or understanding.  I was down there with others of unusual or strange talents.  It was kind of empty or bare, and an unstructured feeling.  Seemed like concrete blocks.  Compared to the tiny house, which was very structured in lifestyle, people knew their role and their place and standing there, and everyone else's, it being so poor, this place was very unstructured and we had more limitless possibilities in our roles and activities.  There was a feeling of coolness or a basement, and while inside, I was aware of the outside, out the windows.  Whereas in the tiny house I felt closed in, no awareness of the outside.  I felt I was there for some unusual reason or to develop unusual talents, or to be with or meet these people.  A little sad or strange feeling.  Feeling of progression, or moving.'
