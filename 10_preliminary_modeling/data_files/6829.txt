A young woman and a man are climbing about on the outside of a building in which I am. Suddenly I see her outside the window of the 2nd floor room in which I am and fear she is about to fall. I hurry to the window to help her in but she slides down by holding to the inside of a large blue curtain that covers most of the facade. While I am outside talking it over with some one, I see a woman with a year old baby dressed in a bright red, elaborately trimmed dress. I beckon her over but she goes to one side and joins two other young women with three very small children. I say to the oldest child, a 3-year old, "How is your big sister?" She asks me if I'm married. I say, "No." Then the women seem to think I'm unfortunate and one remarks they are very fortunate only because they met their men in Germany. I tell them I'm a retired University professor.
