Bullfrog was my boss. He had recently taken over my work (which I think was a supermarket). He was really tall and slim and bald and spoke perfect English with an English accent. He was always mean to me and had cut down my hours so I was barely working. There was a poll about who the killer in Friday the 13th was and 60% of people had voted for Jason Voorhees and I complained because it was his mother and Bullfrog started attacking me for some reason. I fell down some stairs and was lying on my back. I was shouting at Bullfrog and he stabbed another guy. As he was pulling out the knife I was like 'just do it!' and he stabbed me and chopped my head off.
