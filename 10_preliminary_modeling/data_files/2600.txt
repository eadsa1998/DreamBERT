I am standing in a neighborhood street with other women. A huge diesel truck pulls right up to us in an aggressive, belligerent way. It's a stand off. A very tall, strong, almost robotic Swartzenegger type gets out. They want to scare me, intimidate me. I do feel scared and know I must not back down. He looks way down at me and says, "I'll pick you up." I know this will hurt, but I still stay. He puts his hands and fingers right at the sides of the ribs and I'm not sure if his he is going to break my ribs in his grip or just tickle me to death. Either prospect is unpleasant to contemplate. He lifts me high up and I wait. Then I notice I'm in the tree tops and I reach up and grab some small, leafy branches and pull myself out of his grasp by going up in the direction he was putting me (sort of Tai Chi, going with the flow of energy). I scramble among the branches, hoping to find someone that is strong enough to take my weight and small enough (flexible enough to lean with my weight and ease me back down to the ground). I do find one and am back safely. I say to the woman, "Did anyone call the police?" And everyone scrambles around, grabbing telephones. Maybe ten calls went out to the police. This seems to intimidate the two trucks and they carefully back up the way they came and are gone. I now see Howard/my father. I feel strange because of the combination. Is he a peer or of the previous generation. How do I communicate and respond - with open ease or with respectful diffidence? Howard/my father says he is sad. Pete got a divorce and comes to live with him and he hasn't even talked about it with Pete. He should be better able to be emotional and open. I realize I've lived in the same house with Pete for some time now and haven't talked at all. I feel bad. Pete is coming to dinner and I want to talk to him about the divorce and feelings.
