It seems I had a big party at my house. Perhaps it was not so much of a party as a gathering. This gathering consisted mostly of my relatives. I recognized a few of my aunts, cousins, (male and female) and my grandmother. I don't remember serving them anything but drinks and I found myself in the kitchen getting ice cubes. Many of the people came to watch me do this. We sat down at the table for a meal and as I sat down I realized that I was at the table at the downstairs cafeteria at Haydn and I saw one particular girl that I used to eat lunch with when I was a freshman. She is no longer in school and have only seen her a few times since.
