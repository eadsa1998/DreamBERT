It was New Year's Eve. I had talked to a nice man on the phone. His hair was gray. He gave me his son's phone number to call him. It was New Year's Eve. So many people were in Times Square you couldn't even move. I kept going out to see how the crowd dispersed and dwindled shortly after midnight. People moved refreshments to a card table in the basement. I had forgotten to call the man's son. I saw him in the basement. He was sad, overweight with blond hair and an overall dejected look. Not just about New Year's Eve, about life. We went to the darkroom. Jasmine was trying to straighten out the darkroom. Downtown Lee had out razor blades and push pins and change all in his canister and Jasmine had spread the junk out on the counter. It filled every inch of space, the junk. I wanted Alicia to shoot it with me. She suggested 3200 speed film for the shots. We were shooting New York clubs that had existed in the past. There were rugs on an empty space--expensive and woven--more like beautiful mats. They were pretty big and cost a lot. The cheapest one I thought I could afford but I never closed the deal. I liked the back side of the rugs. They were cotton fibers on coarse burlap backing.
