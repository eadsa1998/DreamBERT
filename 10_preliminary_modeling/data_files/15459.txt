I was with people from Community. We were in groups and had to perform a short scene. Mom was there. There was a performance for everyone and one for just the crew. Pierce kept a recorder in his bag. I went to the toilet and sat on the toilet and talked to someone. Pierce held the bag up and Shirley was like 'he's recording, as he does'. He was grinning. In the scene we were doing, someone looked like Frank Whaley and he was playing the lead for their play. Ezra said he would probably be good. Alex (One Tree Hill) broke up with this guy and she ended up with a chipped front tooth. The guy met her in a room to propose sex with her and she took her clothes off. Her boobs were weird looking and she had this gold belly button piecing in her belly button and it was like a bell and really gross. The guy went down on her and then it cut to the guy walking in and she was touching herself.
