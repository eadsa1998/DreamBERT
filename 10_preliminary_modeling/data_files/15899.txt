Tristan and I were on Big Brother. There were actual housemates and also people from the Technical College. Everyone was up for eviction, but people were choosing people to un-nominate. There were eventually 4 of us left, including me. There were over 20 people in the house. I joined the others and they said the four of us left would have to nominate in front of everyone, but then they made us all sit around the edge of the wall (there was a ledge/seat around it), and called out people's names and we put our hands up if we wanted to nominate them. Aisleyne and Nikki were there. I was telling them about how the outside world felt about them but then realised it was outside information and stopped. When they said Lea's name, I put my hand up and was thinking she would definitely go over me.
