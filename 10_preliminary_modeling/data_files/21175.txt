I saw the clouds from a storm out in towards Big City hanging down to the earth like a tornado. I ran for home to tell my family to hide in the basement. I saw fleet factor in paper. The elevator I ran went up and down fast. I had a hard time stopping it on the floor I wanted it. Joe Kassimere was always having trouble with his brother. He always wanted to fight. I climbed on a shanty and said I would keep the fox or wolf away from me. I had a broomstick in my hand and intended to keep the animal away or knock it off the shanty.
