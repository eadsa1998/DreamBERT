I had gone down to the Schofield Bldg. Used to work there. Had stopped in to see my old boss and found out that the girl who had taken my place had left. They wanted me to come back to work and I couldn't give them any definite answer inasmuch as I was, or am, presently working. The bookkeeper was there, though she had changed quite a bit. She had now become quite gray, was wearing black and looked very old. I felt a little guilty for not going to work there. While I was there I noticed a number of applicants, all of whom were elderly women and all of whom were wearing black. I left there and went to my job. When I got there I found Bess, the bookkeeper from my former job, now working on my books. She told me she had quit and was now working for my boss. I then thought that this was a good idea as Bess was an accountant and, with her ability, deserved a better job than the one she had.
