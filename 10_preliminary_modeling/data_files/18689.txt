I made up a little song about sine and cosine, like in math, and I was working equations and singing the song. Out front there was a crowd and video cameras were watching everything and a little baby boy with blond hair just died instantly. His mother came shrieking out of nowhere and snatched up the baby and fought through the crowds like it was nothing. In the crowded store Delores was stealing batteries--one legged Delores and telling me to hush up when I kept on staring at the batteries she was putting away. We were building a loft. It was me and Rudy's space. I could see Alex through the glass. Cups were outside. People in the front were handcuffing guys to the side they were handcuffing 2 more guys. I had been eating a very small apple pie (tart). I told the police I lived there. I had to mop the water that had come through the floor. In front of the gas station I was laying in a lounge chair. Lisa was in the other chair. We were laying out topless. We were both getting sunburned. A snowball fight was going on. They were throwing snowballs at each other, packing the ice real hard like rocks before we threw. She was not a very good aim. My snowball turned into a triangle, sharp in the air and veered off--bouncing up sharply high in the air at a 90 degree angle from where it landed.
