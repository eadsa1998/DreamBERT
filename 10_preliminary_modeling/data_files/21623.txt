I saw Walter Luzra in a hospital. He was talking how silly he was, worried all the money he spent foolishly. He tried to injure me on a couple of occasions, but I was on the alert. He was unsuccessful. I saw a murder committed and then the 2 assassins commit suicide with poison pills. I saw 9, then I put an X over it. I was climbing up after my small box to keep my eye on him so he would not fall or injure himself. I went into O'Korn's backyard to look for something and when I came out in our backyard we had about five piles of burning rubbish and newspapers. I put more on to get rid of all the rubbish. We were looking at race 6. I said, "I think Honey Nob will win. He is p.p.7," and a farmer pointed at the last one, pp.8 and said, "He will win." There was a dent or print of the first horse and the name seemed to be Gold Count. I went into hot water in an elevator shaft to do something. I walked thru water which was hot and about a foot deep to one end of the shaft and reached up my hands to two fellow workers and I climbed up and out. I found two small pies on a shelf. I ate one. I took a long bar from the back end of a car and was going to use it to hold up an open window, but I changed my mind and was not going to do that. I saw a few kids with a tomcat and small kitten. I didn't see what the tomcat was doing to the kitten, but I heard it mew once in a while.
