I was doing a quest or a mini-game on Runescape. I got teleported to this guy called Nostrodamus and he told me to teleport somewhere and then back there. It was then real life and Elijah and Theodore were there. Elijah said "Turn that way for me" and I said no. Then it was Runescape, sort of, again. There were three people there. One guy got drenched, and the other two were in rooms. A person there told the guy to soak the others and two more soaked would die. He told the others and said one wouldn't die.
