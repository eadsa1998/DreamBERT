Dream about my old boss, Mary. She showed me a bottle of shampoo that's supposed to lighten hair color and asked me if I could tell her if it would work. I read the instructions and asked her if she was trying to cover gray hair. She said she didn't have any gray hair. I then was trying to call her on a lie -- without being too antagonistic -- just straightforward. She insisted that she doesn't lie. I was eating some food, then some other employees arrived and I left because I didn't feel comfortable with the shallow game-playing and competition for attention that I expected would occur.
