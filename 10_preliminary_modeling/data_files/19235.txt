I had a dream in a town, it was not familiar to me. It was dark, but the middle of the day. It was in a shopping mall, an outdoor one like a street mall. I was buying dog leashes with Tom Cruise!? We were looking for a specific color, my dog had broken her leash and she needed a new one. My dog was not actually in my dream, just mentioned. I don't remember any dialogue or talking, we simply kept moving from store to store. When we walked out, his wife (Tom Cruise's) was waiting outside in a car for us. We got in and she gave me a hi.
