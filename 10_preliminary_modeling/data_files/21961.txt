I was in our yard at Rivertown. Someone I know, but can't recall, was using our garden hose. Brother Steve and others were kidding the hose user and he would sprinkle them with water. He tried to sprinkle me, but I stayed out of reach of the water. Then there was someone flying and they flashed a flashlight and flashed at his ray and my ray was so strong it made him blind. He stopped using it to flash at us.
