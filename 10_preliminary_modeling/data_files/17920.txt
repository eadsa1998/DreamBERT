I was at some sort of family party.  It was dark..possibly outdoors.  Someone asked my cousin Alice a question and she answered in the third person.  Someone mentioned something in regards to her answering in third person.  I said, "oh yea, that can be fun sometimes."  There were blue slates of cinderblock-like material around the silverware on the table outside.  I had to go to the bathroom and sat on a toilet near a pillar- it was open space and there were people around.  When I pulled my underwear down I tried concealing the evidence that I was on my period.
