I was watching Dexter, although it was something else at first. Dexter was with his sister and they were messing around and ended up having sex, a video camera was on and had recorded them. At first they were other people, I think and one of them said "I can't kiss you, I love you" and the guy smiled and pulled her close and they kissed. They left the apartment and the video of them started playing. Dexter banged on the wall to hide the sound. Dexter admitted to Rita and others that he was a murderer and Deb walked in angrily and said "I slept with you!" and Rita was shocked. Then I was at home and Mom and Ezra were there. Mom went out the back door to leave. This girl asked what I was doing this year and I mentioned MUPC and "college". Then I was at Mom's and she had this baby from next door over, I think, and it was noisy and I said "shut up!".
