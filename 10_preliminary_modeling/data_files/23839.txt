I am in this house, a program for retarded people, and I go through the rooms, and all of them are doing drugs.  They have Downs syndrome, all ages, and the program has them doing drugs.  I think how weird, what kind of program is this.  Part of me thinks: that's what you turn into when you do drugs.  Then I am leaving California.  Like I had gotten Mondo [a coffee shop in Moab that I wanted to buy], I'm packed and leaving.  I'm on the interstate, leaving town, I stop in a coffee shop, and some friends here come in to say goodbye.  I kind of wonder how they knew I would be here.  The coffee shop was really bright and happy, sunlight through the window, a 50's feeling about it, hopeful feelings, motivated and confident and happy about my future.
