The cart of sandwiches was wheeled in. All were buttered so I started to walk out of the dining room. Miss W. called me back. I said there was nothing I could eat. She said she didn't eat bread but she had something she could eat. I said I didn't like cereal. She angrily said, "here take this. Don't ask me where I got it but I'll make you eat it." I took the piece of unbuttered toast. (This incident is based on an actual one though not in all details. I am supposed to have no butter. )
