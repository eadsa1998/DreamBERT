I was taking a bath with bubbles and kitty was in the bathtub with me. She was floating on a little shelf similar to Yukon Cornelius. She saw the shelf of bubbles approaching like an iceberg and she did not know what it was. She thought it was solid until it came up to her and started to get her wet. She put her paw through it and it was nothing. She jumped up and ran away and I wanted her to stay with me. Me and Rudy were suppose to be taking care of things at the house. Behind the house the creek had been turned into a man-made lake. We were looking out the window when a sewer pipe busted and the lake was getting filled up with blood. I said to Rudy, "Unless this is the 'Plagues of Egypt' something is bad wrong." He explained it was the 'fowl meal': crushed up dead birds that were dumped in the water for the fish to eat. That's why it was so bloody. I was desperately looking for a number in the yellow pages of someone who specialized in that type of clean up. Rudy said, "It's OK, my father knows how to make it (the blood) disappear (by) swishing it with brooms in the water. It sounded odd but I knew it would work if my father figured it out. On the subway the doors locked and the lights were out and I could not find the parcel I'd left in one of the many cars.
