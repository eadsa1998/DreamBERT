 I'm eating dinner in a room with a bunch of friends. We are dressed up. There is a slanted wall near the bed I am sitting on, which makes it difficult to sit up and eat at the same time. I'm eating eggs and bacon. My ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas comes in. She is wearing a dress with some fishnet stockings. My friend Anna Woods says it looks like Annie just shaved her legs.
