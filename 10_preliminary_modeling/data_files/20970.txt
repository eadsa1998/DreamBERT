I was at a Jewish celebration. I met a Jewish girl. I liked her and she went for me. We took a stroll and then we were married. We were way up in Canadian wilds looking for her long-lost father. A mounted policeman was to search the wilds for her dad. We had a map and were in the section where he was to be. We walked thru a cave and the mounted policeman said, "How are we going to find the opening here? This is 1500 miles long." We finally came to an opening and I looked down to another section of the cave. It was high. I could see the father-in-law there. I yelled at him, but he paid no attention to me. He walked under cover, then my wife came from under cover and she told him who she was. And then his wife came with other friends and there really was a reunion. When he found out he was united with his wife and child, it was a beautiful scene to see them embrace.
