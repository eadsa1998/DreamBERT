There's a band party - it's like the old days of the band. The old crowd are there including the drummer Luther. Out in the street we start an impromptu jam - mainly on drums. Luther is banging on an assortment of large hand-held drums. Later, in the house, there are plenty of people and excess. My partner is there too but keeps her distance from the main throng, particularly as there is a 'groupie' contingent. People start leaving, (as it is very late) or moving to the upstairs rooms. I find myself left downstairs in the living room with one of the girls. She pretends to be interested in my paintings which line the walls. My partner steps in to find out where I am, and politely says hello to the other girl, and says she's off to bed, leaving us alone again. I was in the middle of reading the girl a bedtime story, even though she is about 21 years old.
