 I'm at Brimson. My friend Tom Napper goes through a tunnel from Tea Hall to Harvard Hall, and is on the phone with my friend Melanie McDyss. I'm jealous of him talking to Melanie. She says, "Hi Hank.", thinking that she is talking to our friend Hank Anderson, or mistaking the two. I wander into Harvard hall, thinking of where Melanie's room is. I'm attracted to Melanie. I go to check my email. It's closing time. The woman in the computer lab indicates this so I leave. I tell her all she had to do was tell me they were closing and I'd have left. My friends Kevin Simpson and Jose Ramos are there. I shake hands with Jose. Kevin and I get up and leave. It seems we're in Australia.
