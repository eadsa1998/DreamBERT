Our family doctor (a good friend of ours), his wife, and another man were visiting my mother and myself in our home. The man left and we heard a shot. We ran to the window and someone was shooting him in the back. Our doctor went out to help him and he was shot four times in the base of the spine. An ambulance came and took both men away. In about an hour the man was back, not much worse for the wear. The doctor was getting along alright, but he would be in the hospital for a while. Some sort of impairment was expected from his injury.
