 I take off in a seaplane, into the wind. I'm flying the plane by myself. Others are on the ground. We're trying to decide when to leave. I land the plane in a very quick, almost crashing way, but the plane and I are okay. My friend Kevin Simpson, my mom, sister Ramona, and my bosses two dogs, Gusty and Musty are there. Arnold Schwarzenegger is also there. He has an X on him. Where I land the plane there is an eagle that is dying, lying in a large skull. I hug my mom, and tell her I love her. The man who owns the plane then flies it, and I push the plane off the dock and climb up the plane as it begins to move. I am getting dragged along a big by the skis of the plane.
