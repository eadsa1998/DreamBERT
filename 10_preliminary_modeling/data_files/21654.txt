I was with my dad and Judy. We were looking at boots that Margie S. owned with her husband. We walked around looking at different things that were on display. Margie was showing us them and would explain the different things and items. I was walking on top of a pond or water. I stepped lightly, then when I tried to walk on top of deeper water, I started to sink above my ankles and got my pants wet. A man came to see me. He wanted to have my picture on shoe boxes and I said I would think it over. He was to contact me later. I was thinking how I would be known by many people by my dad.
