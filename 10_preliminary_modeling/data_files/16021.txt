I was somewhere where I shouldn't have been and was trying to get out. I snuck into the front passenger seat of this car and hid on the floor. Brock got in the driver's seat and was talking to the 'owner' who was Frederick and I was trying to signal to Brock to not give me away, but he didn't even look at me. I realized that he was doing it to not give me away. The parking was underground and he had to drive upstairs, get out to get a key and come back to drive out. I had to get out at the first stop and I waited for a while and walked out. There were lots of people but I didn't see Frederick. I went outside and saw Brock's car pulled up on the side of the road. It was in like a city, it was day and overcast (or at least, it was very grey). His car was kind of like a ranger car and was light grey. I got in and as I did realized it was a dream. I said to Brock 'what are you doing' and I can't remember his reply but implied I would know. I reached over and ruffled his hair and was thinking we should have sex. He made a joke about the fact that the scene didn't change and that 'even my subconscious was rejecting me' and we both laughed and I said 'I can't even get laid in my dreams'. Then I kind of woke up but was in sleep paralysis. I heard Tristan and Frederick talking in my room and then it sounded as if Frederick was masturbating. I could hear the squelchy sounds and then I felt something warm land on my leg. Then I felt someone come close to my face and could feel the hot air from breathing on my face and they started sniffing me. My first thought was that Frederick was going to kiss me and then that maybe it was a dog. I was scared and tried to scream but I couldn't open my mouth or my eyes. I could see the veins in my eyelids pounding and all I could hear was this screech from my blood pumping. I slowly controlled my breathing and woke myself up.
