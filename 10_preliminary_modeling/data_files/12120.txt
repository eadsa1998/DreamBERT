Greg and David Mathew were making out with people. They were at a party of mine, Christie was talking to me and I took a photo of her. I was playing Super Mario and there was a hard level on an island. I was with my husband. There was something about Heaven's Lake? The husband destroyed the boat and chased me. I said three things "if I didn't want to be here I'd take the boat or swim. But I do so I'm here". Jayson stayed over.
