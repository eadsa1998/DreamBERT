A co-worker I was attracted to, Sue, was chiding me about not following up to a porn story. I'd been researching it for a long time. I'd gotten in on the industry. The industry where we were was built on a shady dungeon... filled with water. She was working for the newspaper where I interned one summer while in college. She was writing a story in a cubicle across from me. I looked over and IM'd her. She laughed because I was right there. I looked into her eyes. I laughed. God, I wanted her.
