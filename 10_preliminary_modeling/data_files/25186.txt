 I'm at Annie's house. There is a huge empty room on one of the upper floors on the north side of the house. There is a computer in it and her mother has just been fiddling with it to get it to work. There is a large screen and a mouse. The Thomas' have cleaned the room and two other rooms for guests. In this room are staying twin young men whose families are known to Annie from Prancy College. The young men are heavier, and are in town for a sports tournament. They start to get settle din. Annie leaves. She has to go somewhere. I feel neglected, like I have recently in our relationship. I get ready to go. I tie my cross-trainers too tight. I have a duffle bag and blankets with me. I pack up. The guys thought I was staying there. I say no, I got to go smuggle pigs. I say, "It's a dirty job but somebody's got to do it..." That is my excuse to get out of the company of people that are aiding in the destruction of my relationship with Annie. I am jealous. Annie's sister Tina leaves in running attire.
