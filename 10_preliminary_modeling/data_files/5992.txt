As a teacher in charge of some course, I am grading papers and I reach the one handed in by X. (a female friend). She didn't answer half of the questions, so I give her zeros for those parts. On the other questions, she has written only short answers, so I give her five points out of ten on each. Her low score bothers me and I decide to raise the score on some questions to six points, then seven. "Maybe I am being too hard on her", I think.
