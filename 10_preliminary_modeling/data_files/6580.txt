On ship at sea. Vessel at first, apparently liner, moving swiftly. Gray foaming waves Passing Hawaiian Islands. The vessel changed. A man apparently J. in stern holding baby. The waves splash in from rear, wet child who cries. But he can't find no other place to sit. Can see clearly the spray and the drops on the child's face. Child nearly nude.
