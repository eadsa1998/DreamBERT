I am involved in a SECRET plot to give a patient an injection of Penicillin with a syringe that looks like a novocaine injector; I am scared we will be found out, but a young man, who is NOT a doctor, tells me to be very CAREFUL, it must read exactly 30 mmg, since more could be fatal, less would have no effect. We swear secrecy and I believe the patient recovers.
