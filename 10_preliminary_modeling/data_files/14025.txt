We were at school and the siren went, so we were walking out of school. The little white car (1BEE) was there. Ezra and I got in, but Mom went off to the school. We didn't know how long she was going to be so I drove to her house. I called her and thinking we were still at the school asked, "Why don't you ask one of the teachers?" and I said we were at her house and she was angry.
