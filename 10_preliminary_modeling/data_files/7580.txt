Some relatives of my friend Linda (seems to me, an aunt and an uncle) who lived out in the Rocky Mountains, either Montana or Colorado, had some hair curlers they wanted Linda to have. They wanted Linda and my friend Faye to go out and get them next summer. Linda said she was too tired to go; she had worked hard all summer and needed the rest. So Faye said she would go and asked me to go along to keep her company. I said sure I would. Faye told me that we were going to fly out and the trip would cost $1000.00 and we were going to live there a month. So I asked my parents if I could go and if I could have a thousand dollars, and they said sure, for me to have a trip to the Rocky Mountains it was worth it. Linda said she would go a little ways with us and then she would get off and come back. So we started out and we were in the plane and some fellow on the plane gave me a present. It was a compact with a combination of rouge, lipstick, powder and cold cream all in the compact. We were going up a great big mountain and it was raining, and we got to the top of this real high mountain and the pilot said he had a terrible feeling this was going to be his last flight. He had flown 35 years, but this was the end. And Faye said, "Oh dear, I believe in hunches. We have got to get off this plane." So we decided we would get off at the next landing and look for another plane. And I was going to call my mother and see if it would be all right with her, so I called her from the plane. And she said sure, she wouldn't care if I had to get on a plane that was going to Tokyo first and then coming back to the Rocky Mountains, just as long as I would be safe. So the plane landed on the side of the mountain and we three got off and we were walking through the rain looking for another plane.
