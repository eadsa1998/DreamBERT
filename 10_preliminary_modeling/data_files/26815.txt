 I'm at a hotel with three others. We check out of the hotel. There is a large friendly baggage man. When I walk out the door he tells me that we can give him our luggage and he'll put it in a large limousine-like vehicle. Then he says we can get a ride back to the place we're staying. The people I'm with come down the stairs and I tell them about our luggage option. The luggage man is really nice. The luggage goes through a tunnel to the car.
