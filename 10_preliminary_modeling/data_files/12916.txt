My leg was constantly twitching. I was in a building and I was someone else. A doctor was giving the results. The twitcher wasn't allowed in the room, but everyone else was. The Intro Calc classroom was around the back of the building. I was thinking that I didn't remember ever coming here. Darius and Eugene were waiting outside.
