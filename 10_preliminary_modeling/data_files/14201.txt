I decided to watch the last few episodes of Twin Peaks. This guy and his mother pretended he had turned into a mermaid so he could leave the place. He was swimming in a lake and the cops came and caught him. He jumped back in and now it was me. I was swimming backwards with a cop after me. I was swimming really fast, but he was really close. I almost reached the other side and we had a fight underwater and I got out. There was a creepy lake next to it where someone had gone missing. I sat on this swing and the creepy lake tipped over. I grabbed onto a branch. Then there was a skeleton and it was talking to me. I showed it the swing and then it looked like a normal person, a girl. We went to the cinema and when we left, it was packed. I tried to call some people but no numbers worked. One of the people I tried to call was Alyssa. We got to the carpark and a car pulled up with people in it. Samantha was in there. I asked if she could see the person I was with and she said yeah. The skeleton got in and I sort of explained who she was. The door wouldn't open and I was worried they were going to trap us. Then I was in with Dad in a car. Mittens and a cat called Sam were with us, on the outside of the car. There was a snake and it bit Mittens and then it was near Sam and I said "Sam!" and it got hold of her and then let go. We opened the window and Sam came in. We left and I said that we'd left Mittens.
