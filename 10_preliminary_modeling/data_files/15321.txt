I was at a shop with Ezra and he was reversing the car. I was living at the old house and home and Dad's new house. I was at the old house and there was a water tower thing out the back. For Ezra's birthday they had done some experiments? There was an electrical short which affected the tower and brought it down. It would take months/years to fix. I was then at home and I asked Darren how we were supposed to survive summer without an aircon and I said "I can barely survive summer with an aircon". There were lots of bits of paper outside. Mom said I had to walk the rest of the way down a hill or the paper would get shredded. I didn't understand but did it anyway. The paper slowly shifted and I took a photo. I asked if this was a dream and she said yes. I went to Dad's and looked for food and movies. I couldn't find anything. He was talking later and said my diary would be affected. Later I was at a house with some people and people were getting killed. I think some of them were my friends. There was a bad girl and I chained her up. Cameron Diaz was eating food in front of her. She got close to her and she attacked and escaped. Quinn (One Tree Hill) and someone else ran up the stairs.
