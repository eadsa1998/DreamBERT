I was at Nana's. The cops were searching for drugs. They said they found some and I protested. I ended up with some girl on the run from someone. There was a guy with raccoon eyes and he went into our place. We ducked into this abandoned shop. There was nowhere to go and I hid behind the counter. He came in with goons and looked around but didn't find me. We now had Kurt from Glee with us. As he went to leave he said something and two guys found us and tried to get us and we fought them and ran. There were guards outside. They moved and we left. We went into a shop through the back windows. It was a Muslim shop with food shops etc inside. They came in after us and had to make small talk with people as they made their way through. I bought water at one place. We went into a clothes shop and changed our clothes quickly (it was in a montage). At the end of the montage I was wearing a big black coat and high heel boots. The guys found us and we fought again. Then we all talked.
