 I'm going grocery shopping. I hurry and buy the items I need. I get two gallons of milk. I have trouble finding the fat free gallons with the pink cap and label. There are some gallons of condom milk. This milk has something to do with putting a condom-like apparatus on the cow's udder. I may pick some condom milk up, but I put it back. I get three loaves of white bread. I go to the cash register. My friend's sister Roberta Hacker is the cashier. She gives me a blank check and signs it. The bill comes to $19.18. I'm going to use the check to pay for the groceries. When I start to write in the amount I make a mistake writing, so I can't use the check. I get out a $20 bill and pay. My mom is in the parking lot. She has come to get me: to visit or something. I'm out in the parking lot near the back of a truck. My groceries are in another truck. Another man is there. He is either my housemate Stephen Ramos or Norman Noman. I see that he has bought wheat bread; I bought white bread. I didn't buy any meat. The absence of wheat bread and meat makes me feel like my shopping is incomplete, and poorly done. There is a sewing machine in the parking lot. A man and woman take the sewing machine and start carrying it to their truck. It belongs to my mom. My mom goes over to the people to get the sewing machine back.
