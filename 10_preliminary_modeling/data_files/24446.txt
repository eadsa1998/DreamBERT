Half awake in the dream, I am in some sort of open foxhole. I look to my left and see two VC sappers crawling past. They have mortars and are dropping them on a position ahead of me. I know that I have to move slowly and then spring up and kill them (they are almost on top of me). The friendly position is in front of me. I kill one fellow (VC). The other fellow manages to break free and begins talking into a small radio. He seems to be an FO [Forward Observer]. He talks quickly, as if sensing he is to die soon. We grapple and he manages to stab me a few times. Then he too is dead. Just as this happens, something amazing occurs. The whole countryside goes up in fire. A gigantic conflagration, in twenty seconds hundreds and hundreds of yards of land are on fire. For a few moments I don't know if I've done something good or bad. All I know is that to survive I must jump into the water. It seems that I am right near the ocean. I swim forward, trying to beat the land, which is also racing forward. Then, at one point, there seems a sort of monster or demon that chases me. It too is on fire but submerged underwater. From behind me a friendly force fires a weapon and kills the monster. At once all the other fire in the dream ceases. Then the dream becomes vague. I seem to be greeted by friends, friendly voices. I am facing East in the dream-the sappers are facing East. I myself seem to be out on a mission, away from a main base. The sappers come from behind; the friendly forces are in front (the same position fired on above). I am saved when the monster dies and I seem to have made contact again with friendly forces. I am welcomed back. I have swum almost due South, somehow semsong (sic) land and friends.
