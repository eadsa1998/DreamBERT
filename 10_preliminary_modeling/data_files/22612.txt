I only remember this dream vaguely: I was cleaning my house, dusting the furniture in the living room because we were going to have guests that evening. Everyone at home was busy. I did not know who was going to come to the house. After dusting, I saw myself wiping the floor. It was daytime. I don't remember if I spoke to anyone. I saw everyone at home who lives there. Afterwards, the dream becomes fuzzy, but at a later moment I saw that the guests were all of us who lived there. A group of friends of ours had invited us to a very nice restaurant that I know. They were giving a dinner party in our honor. People were greeting us and I got to see a table decorated very nicely with delicious food. I did not look at the locale too much, but it was big and elegant. It was nighttime. That is all I remember. Note: I also remember that I thought, when I was at the restaurant, that we were the ones offering the dinner party, but when I realized that it was being offered for us, I did not mind it at all. I did not place any weight on that fact. I was happy.
