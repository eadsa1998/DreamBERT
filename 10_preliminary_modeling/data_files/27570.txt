I was working as a nurse in N_____ Hospital at home. However it did not look like N_____. One of the patients stopped me in the hall and told me that her doctor had been in to see her. He had told her she was to have milk and cremalin and then some prostigmin. He had written no order for this so I told her I could not give her the medication until I asked him. Just then Dr. D_____ got off the elevator. He is our family doctor. This was the first time I'd seen him since I started to work there. He was all dressed up in a dark blue suit and a white shirt. I excused myself from the patient and asked Dr. D_____ if I could do anything for him. He told me that he was just on his way to see a friend. He gave me a half used bottle of Penicillin to put away. He came into the nurses station with me and we had a long talk. Then he said he must go to see this friend (girl). I got the impression he was very interested in her. I laughed as he went out and said, "Have a good time." He turned back and gave me a surprised look and then continued down the hall.
