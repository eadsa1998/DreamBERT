I was at the Technical College, which was different and we were getting marked on everything. We went to camera and Mr Norcross said 'who wants to go first?' and Juniper said she would because she thought she would get a high mark and he displayed her mark and it was 38%. Then he put everyone's up and I got 67 and Tristan had 77 and I was annoyed he got higher than me. But later he put them up again and they'd changed, mine was 68 and Tristan's was now 35. He didn't clarify what happened. We went to editing later and it was like a bar and Teacher-F-01 had these hats behind the bar that were to protest something about freeing chickens. A few people were wearing them and I said I wanted one and she gave one to me. Later, Fletcher was hanging around me and being weird. He was like saying he loved me but in a jokey way. I was sitting down with him at one point and he started trying to put his hand on my leg and kiss me and I kept pushing him away and being like, jokingly 'what the hell are you doing?'.
