A friend and I were at this rich house. There were two weird rooms. One was a gravity thing and it had a floor thing that threw you. This mean guy had a nice wife. They had a pool. I kept having blackouts. Charlene added me on Myspace. There were lamingtons. There was some wedding dress from Year 7? I fell over. Jonas was trying to wake me up annoyingly. Ezra was on the computer.
