["Needing to pee."] I am looking for a bathroom. I need to pee. I look in several different rooms, but nothing to use. I go into one bathroom. I find some empty cardboard boxes and a woven basket, round. I start to pee in the basket, standing up over it. I quickly pull some Serene wrap onto the bottom of the basket so the pee won't go through. I pee a lot. Then I try and clean up my mess, carrying the basket trying not to spill any. I put away some of the boxes I pulled out to use.
