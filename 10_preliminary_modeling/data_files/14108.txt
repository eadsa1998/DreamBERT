I was at home. This girl always used the same movie and notes for essays and things. There was a gay movie with gay sex in it. There was a nice desk in the movie. Two more people had taken my quiz and I had a comment. They said "bald isn't hot". Ezra was around. We had this meat thing for dinner and then another meat thing, rice and salad like stuff and a nice chocolate thing for dessert. Ezra was tired.
