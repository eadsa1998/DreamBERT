Me and Rudy climbed under the railroad trestle and down the hill; down a dirt path through the woods and over rocks. William, Ester and Ackerman came along. Ackerman was there without his mother, and without permission from his mother. I wanted to jump in and see where the river would take me. Nobody else wanted to swim, so I jumped in, in my clothes, and started going downstream with the current. When I'd gotten out of sight of the others, the river branched out into 3 directions. It suddenly got very deep. I was going faster and faster. I passed a good rock to grab on to, but I missed it. That was the first detour from the river. At the next fork it became unclear which one was the real river. The rocks on the side were extremely steep, and I let the current take me where it wanted to. I climbed up the tall, steep rock wall and over huge empty 50 gallon oil drums (that were) stacked up 7 or 8 barrels high. When I got to the top, I could see the others far away. I could see that the Con Edison lady was yelling at THEM because I swam down the river. I wanted them to jump into the river to get away from her. The Con Ed lady was mad about me swimming in the river, climbing over the barrels, and (climbing) over the rocks. She thought I was in too deep. She said (that) no swimming was allowed. I felt like Con Edison had no jurisdiction over the river, even if it (the river) did provide their electricity.
