I am in a room. Someone is giving me information that is important for me to know. I can't understand it. I step into a tiny part of another room. I lie down on a couch. A friend of mine like Alan Arkin comes and I laugh because he looks like a Native American Eagle Mask and I try and see him under it. He is friendly and concerned for me. I try and explain what I see instead of him. The yellow neck ruff feathers, the white feathers around his brown round golden eyes. Then an old man who is rich and owns the house is seated up on a wall, like in a high chair. Someone views the room and says Oh, there is no furniture here. She can't be living here. I say I have one chair and the couch. Then the message I didn't understand is repeating. Sentences I try to trace with my fingers. Need the pain, something about the pain. I need to figure out what this all means for my own well being. My friend is sympathetic and wants to help.
