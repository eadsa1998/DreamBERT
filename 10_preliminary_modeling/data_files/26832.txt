 I'm near water on docks. My friend Kevin Simpson and a woman are with me. There's an unusual shaped dock, with many right turns, which Kevin and the woman walk around. I don't want to walk all the way around the dock. I want to jump in and swim across to the other part of the dock. The water is very dark: black. I'm not sure how deep it is, and am afraid of jumping in. I swing down on the dock, below it, holding onto the wood, and drop into the water, swimming the short distance to where the dock continues. We walk on, Kevin is next to me. We move quickly and deftly. There are grates on our path that close in front of us as we approach them. Kevin slides under some of these. I slow down: I'm not up for sliding under closing doors. The doors open up, they are like automatic garage doors. I grab some of them as they close, lifting them up, opening them. My fingers get pinched between the door and the ground. This doesn't hurt, and the door opens back up. I arrive at a group, where I take a folding chair and sit next to my high school classmate Analisa Paulsen
