I am walking home at night through a dark alleyway and I look back and someone is following me. I can't tell who it is, so I am scared and I start walking faster. The person behind me starts walking faster too. Then I start running and the person following me starts running. Then I see a light up ahead and I run to it and stop. Then the person also stops in the light, so that I can see who it is, and it was my friend David (he is one year older than me and he was my boyfriend for a little while). So when I saw it was him, I said to him, "Oh thank God it is only you." And then he says, "Why are you glad it's me?" and he pulls out a knife and stabs me√â then I wake up. I have had this dream three different times.
