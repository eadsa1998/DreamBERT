 I am at a moving theatre watching the movie Black Sheep. Niles and Tim Zelling are there, and we seem to be in some sort of a track meeting. We are going to play basketball after the movie. My mom, my brother Wally, and sister Ramona are there. They might leave, but decide not to. There is a woman with very large breasts there. Wally doesn't like her. There are lots of strange men around, who look "cool". I know a few of them. One is a really tall man. Everyone is smoking marijuana. This movie theatre is really weird. <br/
