I was at my house and the phone range. I asked my mom why she wasn't answering. "It's Becka's mom, she worries about the weather conditions. I don't feel like talking to her." Then a little while later, I was at this big dome house with a living room that had all glass windows so you could see out. There were a whole bunch of kids playing in the front yard. My mom was talking to her friend and I came out of nowhere. Then the phone rang. My mom didn't answer it. But she stood up and walked along the sidewalk. Then she threw her back out and I had to help her walk to nowhwere in specific. Then we came back. Setting: At my house, and some city street, and a big white dome house. Characters: My mom. Pat, my mom's friend. Kids I don't know. Becka's mom. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, angry, sad, scared, worried. I think it was weird that Becka's mom called, because she had just called before I went to bed and my mom didn't answer.
