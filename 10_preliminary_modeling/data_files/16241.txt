My friend Cathy and I from freshman year skipped 5th period and she drove me over to some, she drove me over to Roanoke's, the health food store, and we got spinach rolls and spaghetti and meatballs and we took the food to the park. And we sat on a bench and we were talking and talking about all kinds of different stuff. And we were talking until like 5:30 pm that night, and then she took me home. And I had no idea what time it was, and Mom and Dad weren't really mad or anything, but they were wondering why would I be out so long with somebody and not call them and let them know. And I guess that was all.
