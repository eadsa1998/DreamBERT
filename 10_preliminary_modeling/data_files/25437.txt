 I'm with my friends Kevin Simpson, Bubba Hacker, and Bubba's father Phillip Hacker at the Hacker's house. Phillip gets out a frozen fish. It might be Bubba's fish or Kevin's from the Big Resort Area. We all talk about the Big Resort Area, and how heavy the canoe was. Phillip talks about bruised shoulders, from carrying the canoe, and we agree with him. I say I could only carry it 55 rods with breaks, while Kevin carried it the entire length of Trout Portage with one break. There is a fishing scene. Something white is being used for bait.
