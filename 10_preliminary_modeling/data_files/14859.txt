I was at Dad's new place. It was different and big and had two storeys, but each one was like a house. He bought the bottom one for me. It was big and there were lots of food and wrappers around the place. I was cleaning it up. There was a bar in the shape of a swordfish. It was sorted by categories such as alcoholic, non-alcoholic, wedding night etc. There were windows all around the house (it was like made of windows except for one wall). I had a lot of chicken fingers stored. I needed keys still. My boyfriend gave me a video to watch. Drew Barrymore and a guy were in it. She proposed to him then he had actually proposed and it was actually behind the scenes footage from Heroes. I was going to put it on Youtube. Then my boyfriend had actually proposed to me through the video. I said to Ezra "lucky I watched it". I went to the shop with Mom. Nana had been watching some show with this lady from PETA in it. The lady was hiding out in the shop and Mom needed to gain their trust before she was allowed in. The lady had killed someone too.
