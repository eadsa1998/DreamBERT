It was the day of Laura's surprise party, but it was during school. Nina and I didn't go to school, so we set up the room, and Laura was supposed to come between 12:15 and 12:45 so everyone came, and we were sitting around waiting for Laura to come. She didn't come, and it was 1:00, so I went someplace to wait for her. 1:30, and she wasn't coming. So I phoned school, and Emily answered. She said, "Hilary, are you coming to school?" and I said, "No." Then I asked, "Has Laura left yet?" and she said, "She left 19 minutes ago." So I went back to the party room and I don't remember anything after that. Setting: (A party room and someplace else.) Characters: (Me, Laura, Emily, and some other people.) Feelings and Thoughts: (Not filled out.)
