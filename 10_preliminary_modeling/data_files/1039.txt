A man like Raul is going to be in a play, he and his friend. Ginny and I are in the audience. We're dating the men. Ginny leaves the room for a moment. I sit in something like a church pew. 2 older women, loud talkers and criticizers, sit next to me and behind me. I am embarrassed. I tell them, "Hey, these kids are doing the best they can." The play has a large cast and I'm in the very front row. The play happens in front of me and off to my right. The chorus line is dancing with huge oxygen tanks. Then the play is over. I'm sitting in grandma Agnes' living room. It's like a reception for the cast. Ginny has come back just at the ending of the play and she has squeezed in between me and the noisy lady. The lady is annoyed but I point out to her that it was our bench first. Raul comes out and sits on a couch next to me. We talk about the play. I look out an open window and see a multi-colored baby flamingo bird sneaking in. I say, "Oh! So that is a flamingo?" Raul looks and says, "Oh ya, I guess so." He's not too interested. I encourage it to come in. There are 2. They both come in and I shut the window before they can escape. My mother has been waiting a long time. She'll be happy. I tell my father, "Hey, the flamingos are here." He says, "Oh, let them go, she hasn't got the bookcases that were going to go with it." I say, "No! She really wants this. She can arrange them differently if something isn't here." He shrugs his shoulders. Then Andrea comes up all aglow and says, "Barb, thanks so much for the card," and goes on to thank others for their gifts. I shrug it off; it doesn't matter. I feel glad that she thanked me but embarrassed that it is only a card.
