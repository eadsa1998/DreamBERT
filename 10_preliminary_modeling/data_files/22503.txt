Later I dreamt that I was in the red patio of my home and that there was a group of girls at the door and I had to guess their names. There were two girls from the university who were dancing, and when I guessed their names, they stopped dancing. There was a fat one I called Julia, a dark one I called Rose, and Sarah who danced ridiculously. Then I called a girl whose real name is Nelly, Doris, and I was right, and everything disappeared.
