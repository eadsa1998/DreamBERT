I am in bed. There is a little vivacious girl with me, bouncing around. My roommate (helper) and (Toni) comes in and is going to help me straighten up things in there. My other new roommate, a male named Tony, comes in and is "talking" to her. He touches her and leans into her like an Italian who is angry. There are sexual and aggressive undertones. He touches her top part of her chest. She tells him to please not touch her when he talks. That makes him more aggressive and belligerent. I sit up and say, "Tony, Tony, Tony," trying to get his attention. He ignores one and continues to push on her. I am firm and insistent. I say, "She's made it very clear that she doesn't want you to touch her. If you intend to stay here, you'll have to respect that and leave her alone." His attitude is one of, "I'm not doing nothing wrong," but he backs off. He looks like he is crying. I realize he's vulnerable. I get up out of bed and walk (well and with ease) over to him and say, "Tony, wait. I see you're feeling hurt. This isn't about you personally. You can still live here if you follow the rules." He says, " I'll think about it," and leaves the room. I'm pretty sure he is going to leave and I think for a moment. I'll have to give him back his $95 for rent and I could use the money. But oh well, if I must, I must. I shake my head, "How ironic. I got a roommate who was molested and one that molests." I hope it works out, but I am clear that he goes if he doesn't change. I can always get another roommate. I then walk to the closet. Tony follows me and asks what I'm doing. I say, "I feel like wearing a different dress today." I look at different ones. She shows me several purple ones I used to wear. I say "This one," and it's an old-fashioned green print dress with puffy yellow sleeves, sort of wagon days style. She says, "That sure is different, sweet and old-fashioned." She unbuttons several of the top buttons. I'm going to put it on.
