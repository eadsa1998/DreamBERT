I was in the flats working on the old B and S. I knew it was a dream. I saw Hank Seegert and Louie Kaufman, our foreman. He came over to look at machine 26. It was so clear to me. I knew Louie was dead and this was a dream. I saw Hank come to the machines, so I walked up to him and asked him what the daily double would be today and he turned away from me. I said, "You know Hank, tell me." He said, "I don't know and I don't know the names of the horses." As he walked away, he said Corralee or Correlee would win the first race. He kind of mumbled it. I didn't quite get the right name.
