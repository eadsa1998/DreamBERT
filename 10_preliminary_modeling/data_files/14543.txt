It was raining, or at least was cold. I was going to university and Mom was driving me. I got in the car, then it was raining. I decided I didn't want to go when we got there, but I went in. I got to the line for class and decided not to go in and this guy said to count me in with the dead, which was a term used for those who just decided not to go. I saw Ms Ingram in the class. She saw me and pulled me aside. There was a huge book of notes and it had notes for every subject and also the exam results. I waited outside in the carpark and Mom and Ezra were across the road at a deli. They picked me up. I got 61% for communications and for math it said "11-12", which was a bad rating. My rank was 195/250.
