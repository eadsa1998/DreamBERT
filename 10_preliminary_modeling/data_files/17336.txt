At home, there was a dirt floor and a hole in the wall by the head of my bed.  We didn't want to lie that high up near it because of the potential of bugs.  My boyfriend Jeremy and I were making out about 2 feet below.  I got up and saw a bug- it looked like a rock, about 2 inches, with bird poop on it.  But it was walking.  Back and forth between that and with my brother Stuart walking one of the dogs, poop got all over the place.  He was picking it up with his hands and wanted me to help pick it up, barehanded.
