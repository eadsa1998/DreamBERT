I can't believe how this summer is flying by. I was having some dreams last night. The first was like I was going to get on a plane to go to Jackson to stay with Aunt Christine and Uncle Larry and Mom, and it was going to be kind of like old times, and I was getting excited. But the thing was, that things got all goofed up because ____________ that I put things off and I was running around at the last minute, and I was packing and stuff. And I didn't get to the airport until like a little _____ before. And it's funny, this airport was really, really different. It was like an old _______ building. But I felt like I knew my way around it really well, all by myself. And there were all these rooms, but there was only one gate where planes would take off. And, you know, it kind of looked like the old hotel across the street that got knocked down where the town homes are now. It was like walking around in there. It was totally deserted. There were windows letting lots of light in, but there were no electric lights. There was like b______ concrete floors and old scraps of junk laying around. And there was this old rickety elevator that you couldn't really even know if it was going to work or not, and there was a regular stairwell. So what you had to do in order to get to the place where planes took off, was you have to go up to the third floor, which I did. I was able to go on the regular stairwell. And then there was this little room you had to go in, like Mom's crawl space almost, except you could stand up in it. And it was like a closet in Grammy's house actually. And then you had to climb straight up a little ladder, in total darkness, and I was pretty, I don't know why -- I shouldn't have had a problem with that -- but I was really afraid and I did not want to do that. I guess I didn't know how I was going to get my bags up there, and I don't know, it was just kind of scary. It was another one of those step dreams, I guess. And I was considering taking the elevator the rest of the way, but there were a couple other people around at this point and they said that the elevator didn't go that high, it only went to 3 and stopped. [yawning] Can you tell the rain kept me up last night? And so in the end, I think I missed the plane. I can't really be sure, but people were telling me they could see out the windows, you know, the truck that moves it sometimes. The truck that moved it was moving it, and it was pushing back and I didn't even get, I didn't have the, I was diddling around too much and I didn't have the nerve to finish that last leg of the journey to get out there to get on. And that was a real, real bummer. I didn't know what I was going to do. And then I woke up, fortunately, and heard it raining and was awake for a while. I was really glad, but awake nonetheless. And I went back to sleep, let's see if I can remember. Oh, I dreamt that I was playing with Erin. I was taking her to the park all by myself, and having to keep track of her. And she was older than she definitely is now, but she was like three or four and she was running around like Taylor does, and I was holding __________ keeping track of her. And she had a different voice and she was even speaking like Taylor. And she was climbing a tree and I was following her up it, and I was climbing it too. And I think I was wearing jeans and no top, and I got her back home. I had a wagon and then we were all going to go to some kind of a show. And I don't remember anything about that.
