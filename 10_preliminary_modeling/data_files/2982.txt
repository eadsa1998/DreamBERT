I am in some sort of soap opera. The man is black and I am white, so the producers had him "married" to a black woman, but he comes to me and says, "It's you I really love," and embraces me. He kisses my throat open-mouthed like a bite, only it's a delicious kiss and I love it and respond warmly to his advances. We agree that it doesn't matter if he's black and I'm white. We love each other.
