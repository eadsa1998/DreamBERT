I was studying in an old sofa (it wasn't the living room at home, although the rest of the furnishings were from there), but I had a test that afternoon, and I was studying hurriedly. The sofa was big, and next to me there was a girl of about 4 years, wearing slacks, whose face I couldn't see because she had a hood on. She was wearing white boots. I saw several people sitting in front of me and talking to my mother, but they didn't look at me or ask me what I was doing. They seemed to be ignoring me. Afterwards my father came and told me to go because it was raining. I bundled up and we left with the little girl who did not speak. I saw my uncle Ollie come out of the house with his children. They were going home in a blue car. We walked a lot in the rain, and in a hurry. I remember that my slacks were black and wide-bottomed, and that I had put on my coat on the wrong side, because I could see the blue lining. We were in the car. It was a two-way street, and almost all the cars -- there were trucks also -- were parked. My father had carried the child and after a while we got to the car. I and the girl sat in the back seat and my father was at the wheel. In the car we arrived at a school. I recognized the gate of my high school, but inside it was totally different.
