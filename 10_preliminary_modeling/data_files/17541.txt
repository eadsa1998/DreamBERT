I was in a band.  I didn't have a very established place.  I waved a scrubber in the air and sang some, ad-libbed, along with some Tuvan.  I wished I could have been a bigger part of everything. I was really hyped after the concert and dug the music we'd made.  I wanted a copy of it.  I needed a shower badly.  In the car, we were showing my cousin Allen what we'd done.  Looking at a magazine, he saw a picture of kids, supposedly showing how we should dress.  "Hey look, you have one on your pants."  I had colorful beads attached to my pants around the waist, sort of looking like a clown.
