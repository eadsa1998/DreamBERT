Dovre comes to me upset. I suggest to her that she create a ritual, a ceremony, and then she'll feel better. I suggest that she go outside to the big bathtub and I'll lay her down in the water. I tell her to think of the words she wants said over her. I feel a little tired, but agree to do the ceremony with her or for her. I also tell her to think of what to say to other people ahead of time. I give her examples for my mother and for Jake. I say, "So if Jake says, 'Yeah! That's stupid,' you can say, 'I can see you don't agree with my decision, but I think it's important.'" Something about religion. Something about a baby. I pick up an unfinished crocheted rug, round, in pastel baby colors, and start to crochet. I tell Dwight that if he wants me to make one for his baby, it would cost a lot. It feels good to be doing my crafts again.
