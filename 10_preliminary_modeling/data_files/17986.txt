Something about being in a play or musical again.  Someone wanted to hear my '1st' Huun Huur Tu CD.  They were curious about the progression: someone explained that with each CD a new level of happiness was discovered, opening it up paving the way for something even greater.  We had been listening to the latest, and they were curious about hearing the first in contrast.
