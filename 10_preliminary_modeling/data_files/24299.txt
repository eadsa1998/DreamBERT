Met my longtime friend Chris for a burger at the lopsided, water-logged Denny's with Mrs. Timmons (mutual biology teacher from high school) as a waitress. The area was somewhat outdoors, or from the damp feeling of the place, exposed to the falling rain outside. Mrs. Timmons seemed to recognize us. We sat at a table in an aisle between another row of tables and a booth. I prefer to sit against a wall.
