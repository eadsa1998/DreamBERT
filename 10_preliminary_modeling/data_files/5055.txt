I am showing a story book to someone and explaining that even before you start reading the book, the story is there in the symbols. I show them the cover and I see a night starry sky -- expansive earth and a hint of a person and I say, "See, here is a night sky, symbolizing intuition and the unknown. Here is Mother Earth, solid, foundation. Here is a person, etc. Then I turn the page and see animals: a horse (steady friendship), a rabbit (sweet and playful but loud out toward the end, tricky), etc. [BL]
