There was a camel caravan and covered wagons. Someone was being chased by lawmen. Later I was in a house with my mother. A lawyer telephoned and my mother answered. She said I would have to go and answer some questions. I had a brass belt and I wanted to carve certain letters on it. I worried about the questioning. I had to go there right away.
