I dreamt I was someplace where a flood was coming. It was a big flood. This flood kept coming up over the building and everybody that was in this particular town - it wasn't identifiable either -- kept running up into this one big house to get away from the flood. I remember my father being there, and I thought it was the end of the world, and was asking my father if this was the end of the world. He told me could very well have been, and I was kind of hesitant to ask him if it was too late, you know, if I too could be saved. I don't remember if I finally asked him or not, but I remember it was on my mind. After a while the flood finally went down, and I remember getting into my car - it's my Volkswagen -- and taking off and driving. And I ended up in a restaurant someplace. I think it was in Georgia. And there were some people there that I knew, I knew in the dream, but I don't recognize them now as people that I know in real life. One of them wanted a ride home, a male. So we started to take off and another flood came for some reason, and I remember trying to get just in front of it, but it kept coming behind me and catching me. And I had a wreck, a small one, but I remember my steering wheel of my car, that there was just a little nub left to it. There wasn't much left of the steering wheel, just enough to control with one hand.
