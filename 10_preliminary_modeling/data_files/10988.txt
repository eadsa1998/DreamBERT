This dream was about a new dress that I bought. I went downtown shopping in Halle's, I believe, and a very sweet elderly lady helped me select a dress that I would like. The lady was short, wore a black dress, had gray hair, and was very pleasing and sweet to talk to. The dress we picked was a high neck, short sleeved affair with a tight fitting waist and full skirt. Needless to say, I was very happy and thrilled at finding just what I wanted.
