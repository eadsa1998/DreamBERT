Criminals were chasing me and my friend Lori. We finally got home but when we got right into the door, we were about to fall asleep. Then two people knocked on the door. My sister, who now was with me, said that it was for me but I couldn't tell who it was. So I didn't open the door. Then I all of a sudden got a cell phone and it rung, it was my best friend Lori. She wanted to tell me to come to basketball practice. "If you want to start you have to take a test," she said. Setting: A house with an outside-looking (illegible) pool indoors, and my house. Characters: Lori, my best friend who lives down the street from me. She's really small and quiet, but sometimes she can be loud. Barbie, my sister, is really nice but we get into fights a lot. Me, and criminals I don't know. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, worried. I was scared but in the dream it wasn't like I was thinking that this whole thing wasn't wacko. It was like my everyday life, but now I think it's wacko.
