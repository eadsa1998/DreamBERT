There was much more to the dream than this, but I can't remember it. I dreamed that I was supposed to go out with a boy on Saturday. I'm not sure which boy it was, but it was one of two that I date now. Then another boy named Victor asked me out for Saturday. (Victor is the first boy I ever went with. We broke up several years ago, but there has been attraction on both our parts ever since. I still like him, but he goes out with a good friend of mine. Since we understand each other, he periodically comes and tells me all his troubles.) When in the dream he asked me out, I knew that I already had a date, but I said okay, I would see him Saturday. He grinned, looking as if he knew about my other date, and left.
