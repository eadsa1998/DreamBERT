Lucy and I are in a house. Justin, her husband and Lorne, her ex-husband are there. I beg her not to pay any attention to Lorne. He's like a milder form of that horrible man. She struggles with her indecision and then agrees. We slam doors shut against him. We then begin to go upstairs. The stairs are ornate, cloth brocade and appliques. I point out several lovely rooms. One entirely gray bedspread, drapes, wall paper all match. Then the stairs are bright red with a soft pink accent. I tell Lucy about it. We reach our rooms, which are on the top floor. There isn't much furniture and the rooms aren't as pretty as the others. We are disappointed and think about returning to the lower floor. Justin is with us.
