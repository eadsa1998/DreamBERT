 I'm in a barbershop, which may or may not be the one I've gone to in Oak Valley. My hair is short, but I get it cut with a hair clippers that has an extension on it. The barber starts to cut my hair right above my forehead. The clippers cuts really close to my scalp, almost shaving all the hair off! I tell him that it is cutting too short, so he changes the clippers to a longer setting and finishes cutting. He trims my neck too. There is a patch of near-baldness in front where he began to cut with the first setting. I need to pay for this haircut, which seems absurd: Why the fuck would I pay someone to cut my hair?
