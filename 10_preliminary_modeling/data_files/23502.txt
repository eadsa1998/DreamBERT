I have a big house, perhaps not mine, but an angled Victorian, which has a swamp behind it. I keep going into the swamp with my mom. I am supposed to be in class -- I have a lab at 4:00 pm, but I keep going into the swamp at that time instead. As I walk along the street, I see a man peering at me from a stand-up outdoor bar -- it is my professor, and he says "Why aren't you at Lab everyday?" I avoid the question and go back to the swamp. This time I invited a girlfriend in but she gets lost in the swamp.
