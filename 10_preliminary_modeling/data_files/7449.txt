I am lying in a double bed. To my right, and in bed with me, is Mary's mother. To my left, but in a separate bed, is Mary. Mary is falling out of bed. I move towards her to help her get back into bed. But she is afraid I'll hurt her. She is angry at me and warns me to leave her alone. I am able to calm her and get her into a more comfortable position in her bed. Mary looks good. She has all of her gorgeous hair, and she is as beautiful as she had been before getting sick. I think I am surprised to find my mother-in-law in bed beside me, and not Bonnie. But I don't give it much thought because I am mostly concerned with helping Mary.
