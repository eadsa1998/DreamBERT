 There is an airport, and a bad cat-like woman. There are three comedians in an act. One of the comedians is outside. There are three lines in the sky, which seems to be dark. The lines are close together. One of the lines is traced in red crayon, while a comedian waits for the audience to get back. The comedian and the line in the sky are outside a house with people in it.
