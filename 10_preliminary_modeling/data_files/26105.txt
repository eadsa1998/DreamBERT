 I'm at Grocery Getto in Oak Valley. I go to the bratwurst sale stand and order two bratwursts. The man there is out of cooked bratwurst, so I wait for two to be cooked. They are cooking in oil. I tell the man I'm going shopping and I'll come back for the bratwurst when they're done, even though I've already paid for them. He says okay. He has a water pump that squirts a thin stream of fluid. I ask if it's okay to leave my backpack there while I shop. He says okay. But I realize I'm leery of leaving my back because I have my dream journal in it. I also see my Paleontology notebook in my stuff. I walk towards the entrance. I see my dad in the parking lot pushing a boat with a wheel on the front. He has a beard. When I get near the door there are two huge white vehicles with huge open spaces, which are beds, in them. I ask the man what they are for, and he says they are leaf carriers for the city. I go inside. I need a grocery cart. An old lady wants Cinnamon Bran cereal. I point out it to her where it is. She pulls a whole pallet out with Kix cereal on it. I push the pallet back. Small boxes of Kix are only $1.39. I buy some, as well as some laundry detergent. A man who works for Grocery Getto is standing around the items for sale. He's wearing a white shirt and maybe a tie. I see some Big Resort Area food packs, gear, and equipment packs for sale. There is also rain gear and a tarp. I think I should buy some of it. I know that Drummonds Incorporated runs a lot of covert pornography, and that I could expose them and absolutely ruin their business.
