[1997-08-03] I was thinking bacon and eggs! I was holding that same large pan and the same cover to that large pan. The scene changes and I was in the examining room where I go to my ear, nose and throat specialist. I was in that room, he was there, he tried to leave me, I don't know why I was there for a checkup, because when he tried to lead me toward the chair where I sit to have the test done, I resisted and he said "Well don't you want to know what I am going to do?" I said "You told me the last time I was here that I didn't have to have this test done, and I'm not going to!"
