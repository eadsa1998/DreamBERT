I can't remember what we were doing, but we were going to have some kind of party at the house. And the, we had to have the amplifier receiver in the freezer. We had to have it centrally located there in order for it to work right, and it wasn't big like big and bulky; it was small, it was the size of the microphone bass thing. And I think there was this singing group that was coming to the house, and again Samantha, Sandra and Derek were in town. And they were going to have like a party on the porch. And we had like an outside system set up on the porch, and I couldn't, we couldn't get the sound system to work right, so Mom was working feverishly putting the food together and I was like opening the freezer door and messing with the receiver. I changed the selector from A to B so that it would be on the outside system on the porch, and meanwhile while I'm trying to do this to get it to work right, Mom's like yelling to me that she needs me to help her with the food, and she's like taking my trip and almost tripping me. And I told her I can't do that now, I've got to do this, and I think she finally got the picture. And I finally got it to work right for them, and [laugh] it took me a little while to understand which CD they wanted cued up because to me they all sounded the same, by this singing group that was kind of a bland version of the Spice Girls. And, let's see, I think -- oh, that's it.
