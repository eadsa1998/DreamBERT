In Thailand, though a mix between the 1536 (the apartment I lived in while a junior in college) crowd, and a relative's house. It began with some drinking, a lot of drinking somewhere. Earlier I was watching a cartman-like character give identical gifts to people and try to infiltrate a counseling center. I went in there with a Rachel Newell-like character (a friend from high school, college, and the city where I now work). She was sitting on my lap, though there were other hot girls inside and I didn't want it to seem like she was my girlfriend because I wanted to hit on them.  My good friend Daniel and his girlfriend were in there too. They were getting relationship counseling. Inside the Thailand house, I had my minions. Slaves, basically. Like followers in Fallout 3 (a video game). I ordered them to do funny things to impress my friends. There was a chainsaw, or something scary around there.
