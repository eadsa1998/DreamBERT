I was talking with Ann. I saw a monkey face and I told her a colored man looks like a monkey. Then I looked at Ann and her face looked like a monkey's. I told her so. Her head was just like a monkey's, hair and all.  I looked at her and said, "I saw you once before and you had a monkey head on before." She went into the other room, then came back and I said, "You still have a monkey face." Then it changed back to her own face and I said, "Now you look yourself again." Judy was kissing her mother and she was sticking out her tongue and Ann said, "Don't do that, Judy. That's no way to kiss." I said, "You kiss like this," and I kissed Ann. I saw flying in the entries. I was going to fry some food. I was pouring soiled or used fat that was black into a container and it was full and running over and all over the floor. I got some sawdust and covered the oil to absorb it. A fellow started to mop up the sawdust with a mop. I said it would be better to use a broom because the grease will stick on the mop and get it all greasy, which will be hard to get off, and it also would not come off the floor. I was digging in the ground or spading the garden.
