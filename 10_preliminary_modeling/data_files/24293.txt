I was going to meet Beth (friend with benefits). She was living in my old bungalow in the city where I had my first newspaper job. She was there with a roommate, a guy, a harmless guy, who was smoking pot in the alcove when I came in. Beth said she had to take a shower or get ready or something. I was supposed to wait outside. But, of course, I did not. I went in and smelled the pot in the alcove and could tell the guy was there, but he didn't seem to know or care. My footfalls were very silent, near the place where I kept my laundry basket filled with all the junk I had in my SUV back when I lived there. She came out and said she had some sort of menstrual bleeding problem. My first thought was, dammit. That's never fun. Then I wondered why. I asked, "Isn't that caused from things like abortions?" She said, "That's not something I have to talk about" or something to that affect. Or "You don't get to ask that." I wondered if it was mine, but didn't ask. Secretly, I'd be relieved, but if I had knowledge ahead of time, I'd force myself to make the hard decision and try to keep her from going through with it.
