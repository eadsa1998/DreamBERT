 I'm upstairs at home, and Amy Lepoard is there. She and Virginia Hamms have just taken all my socks and underwear and hid them in the attic above to my old room, but the attic is instead above the hallway. The small square cut out in the ceiling in my room is in the hall, so I grab a chair to reach it. Amy is real close, and I am vulnerable if she would knock the chair out form under me or do anything else. I poke my head and torso up through the hole. To my left are my socks and underwear, and to my right some boxes and a bike. The attic is larger than in real life. My friend Tom Napper is there. He has a camera, and I'm going to take a photograph of the clothes. I look through the lens on the fancy camera, trying to get it all in focus. I take a photograph by accident with the camera pointed in the wrong direction. Tom somehow squeezes through the hole at the same time I'm in it, and takes the camera to take a photograph.
