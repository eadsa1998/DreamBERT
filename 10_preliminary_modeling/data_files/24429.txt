In the dream I am a soldier flying a small balsa wood plane by telepathy. It crashes to the ground. Another solider sleeping nearby is wounded in the head. As I return to my living quarters I retell the incident to a group of soldiers that are following me. Two blacks become greatly excited. One takes out his pistol and wags it carelessly. I am shot in the thigh. I think of the dull pain that begins to throb. The blood begins to gush from my femoral artery. I wonder where I can find a tourniquet. I wake up.
