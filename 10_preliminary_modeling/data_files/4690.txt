["Gaston dies."] I am watching TV. I see a news story about Gaston. It's an interview. I see the lovely modern non cluttered look of the inside of his house. He is doing some silly trick of standing up on some logs near a fireplace and balancing. I am shocked to hear that he had just died. I feel sad. I also wonder if he left a will. Who will get his stuff? I'd like to get some of it, but I can't imagine he would have left any of it to me. I feel guilty for thinking so materially and selfishly. Now I am remembering a meeting he and I had before he died. We are meeting at a cottage off a country lane. He is very sweet and friendly. I am trying to remember if he gave any clues that he was going to die.
