 I'm in a bagel store with my friends Bubba Hacker, Kevin Simpson, and later, Sam Kingsley. Some of the employees there are wearing orange aprons. People play cards, and are playing Double Deck Feffer. Someone plays the 25 of Hearts. I don't know any of the four or five people that are playing. I'm really interested in the game and would like to play. Diamonds seem to be trump at one point, with both five of diamonds being played, and the seven of diamonds taking the trick. Bubba and Kevin goof off behind the counter, even though they are customers.
