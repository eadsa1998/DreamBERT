["The funny Russians."] I am traveling in Russia. I am in a wheelchair. I am in a University and touring the accessibility issues. It isn't very accessible. I keep finding stairs. But then I see a group of women playing a noisy slapping gam where they hit the tables rhythmically. It looks like fun and I decide I will join them. I go down the hall looking for a way in and find one. They laugh and applaud. I sit at a table with some of the women and we laugh and slap the tables in the game. Then I stand up and et into a narrow door where the trick bathrooms are. A Bob Hope comedian is there and he and I create a routine where he stands by an back door of the elevator bathroom. And I say are you going down? And he says yes and steps up and into the door and disappears. A colorful paper cover is there and I try to find him in there. It's a special Russian trick. We laugh and I finish the trick by going out the front door. We repeat this wherever we find a trick Russian bathroom. Now Bob Hope and I are strolling arm in arm in a park and enjoying ourselves very much. Even though he is very old, our senses of humor are very alike and we have fun.
