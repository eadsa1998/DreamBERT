C. and I were seated on a fence on top of Killington. There were two or three cottages in sight within a quarter of a mile as we looked to the east and I was speaking of a new road now open from these houses to North Shrewsbury, passing "Mose Lefevre's." A blue gray beast as big as a buffalo suddenly raced over the peak. I pronounced it a bear, but have since realized that it was the enlarged image of our cat.
