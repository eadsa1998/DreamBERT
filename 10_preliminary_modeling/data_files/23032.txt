I was driving -- with my wife Bonita, I guess -- either northwest (towards town) on Hill Road near the library.  On the right ahead was a new Howard Johnson's.  First, though, there were twin restaurants, of the franchise kiosk-style type, on either side of a parking lot.  Each one had a carhop with an enormous papier-mâché head of a horse or donkey, which made them almost as big as the kiosk itself.  The Howard Johnson restaurant, on the other hand, was mounted about halfway up a tower of about three or four stories in height.  The restaurant was round, considerably exceeded the tower in diameter, and slowly revolved.  For some reason, I felt compelled to ridicule the idea and the people eating there.  Actually, though, I thought it would be a good way to get a panoramic view of the surrounding area.  We went into a restaurant, but it wasn't that one.  It reminds me of the place we ate lunch in Paris just before leaving-rather stark, with dark brown benches.  There were a couple of very pregnant women sitting on benches, and a couple of others came in while we were there.  They were unmarried and were talking about having abortions-apparently that's what they were there at the "restaurant" for.  They were a little embarrassed, but not much, and rather cheerful, I thought.  I was shocked at the thought of their having abortions so late in their pregnancies.
