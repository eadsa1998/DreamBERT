I was a teminator. I lept from the cliff onto the pine trees below after fleeing from the shoe store with the glow-print eating nerd hipster idiots. One tried on a hat in this abandoned store. They were roaming around earlier, looking for food and other items in the fields like cattle. Irradiated patches of wheat and mushrooms. As I was running away from the guarded main road, I came across a band of them. I ran with them as the other terminators came after me. In the store, the idiots put in a DVD and messed around with the phones, which they didn't know how to use. They probably didn't get killed because they were idiots. Later I went out and tried to escape in a truck that had been there fueling for months, with the nozzle still in the gas tank. The truck and other vehicles were soon ripped apart by the other terminators -- which were more looming and massive than I'd seen before. I tried to run down the road. They followed. I ducked into the brush alongside the road. I had a feeling that I could not escape, no matter which way I ran or how far.  Dream went into a transition, as I was a bare skeleton without skin; it had all gotten peeled off as I fell from the cliff and into the pine trees. I had run and jumped off a cliff and got skinned on the way down. I wanted to get into a stasis to heal. I was just an exposed skeleton with chunks of flesh attached, even my spine. But it was all heavy, articulated metal. I arrived at the bank of a lake or river near a school. This whole town was playing baseball by the river; it was on the edge of the city. The old mayor man had a beard like Santa and tiny spectacles.
