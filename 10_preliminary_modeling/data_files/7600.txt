I went to visit Tim W at WDF. When I arrived, they had made many changes including how to get in. I had to enter one side of the building, climb up and across a wall that had many tools hanging on it. It was a big empty room and there were two men receiving tennis lessons. As I finally made it halfway across the wall, one of the men showed me an easier way to get to the entrance. I went up two flights of stairs and entered the door. It brought me into the company breakroom. I noticed a group of people at one table that included Freda L, Jeff L, and Susan J. They didn't even say hello. I tried to sit down with them and someone made a comment about me taking up too much room. I got up to leave. Then Susan J asked what was wrong. I said no one even said hello. She got up to go with me. She took me on a tour of the new plant. Her area was a special project she was experimenting with. It involved raising African Violets and using the petals to create dyes for fabrics. I then went on without her as she started watering her plants. In the next part of the plant they were showing me how they were testing this dye to create prints on fabrics. One of the people painting was the attorney who shops at NTNS. Now they're using these dyes and this process on people's hair. I was very frustrated with how they were doing it. It was all I could do to keep from saying something. Then they convinced me to let them do my hair. I finally spotted Tim W but he was with his boss. I realized I wouldn't be able to talk with him. As I left, I went back thru the employee breakroom and was spotted by Marcia N. I didn't especially want to see her. She came up to me and spoke briefly. It was much easier getting out of the building than it was getting in.
