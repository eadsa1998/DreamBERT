I was working at the computer on something related to profession. The information on the document was laid out similar to the search results from an internet search engine. I was verifying the accuracy of each heading or title and then the accuracy of the information that followed. I was updating or making corrections as I found them, but was pleased to realize that almost no corrections were needed and just a few updates.
