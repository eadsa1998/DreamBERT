 I'm in an old room that has the feel of a pale green color. My mom is there. Something happens with a window. My upper body is hanging out of the window, and has gone too far down near the ground. The building is old brick. The reason we're leaning down is that my mom has come and leaned out of the window as well. Someone else is there with me. My mom is on the phone. My friend Tina Totts is there. She puts on bright red lipstick and is all made up for a prom photograph. She walks over to the people who are also having their photograph taken. I see that one of them is a man who was my high school classmate Holly Hughes' prom date. He looks a lot like my junior high classmate Fred Grendson. <br/
