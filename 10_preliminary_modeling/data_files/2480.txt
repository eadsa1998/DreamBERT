I am going to meet Josh for a date. I'm late and can't find the place we agreed to meet. I turn right down a sandy, bumpy trail/driveway and park. I get out. No Josh. I notice I'm a half hour late; it's 7:00 pm. I wonder with some sense of foreboding if this means I'll have to kiss Josh (because we're having a date). I walk up a few wooden steps to a wooden landing and open a door. I see a bed with three cats on it. Then I see Josh, who is upset and out of breath. He pops into the room from another doorway from a hall at the head of a stairway (see drawing). He's wearing a hobo costume, wig, baggy pants like a clown. He says, "I had a hard time getting here. I had to take the express west. I've set up another time. See ya." He starts to leave. I am annoyed and confused. "Wait, I say, can I drive you home?" "Oh," he says, distractedly, or I say, "Is it hard to find?" He points, vaguely to the right; he has his back to me and says, "It's Hillyard West" (that is pretty far). I say, "Ok, OK," he starts to leave. I am upset that he'd leave after all the trouble I went to and won't talk about why he's left it up in the air about when we meet again. I'm kind of relieved, feeling like for some reason we won't see each other again and also mad because I'm feeling dumped and rejected, feeling some shame. Maybe if I'd been on time, he wouldn't be so upset with me. I want to say, "Let's talk this over. I'm feeling upset," but I don't say anything and shrug. He hurries down the stairs and away.
