I was watching an old episode of Supernatural. It was night. Sam ran down a path into a group of black ghosts and he screamed like 'wah!' and ran the other way. Ezra and I were talking about it later. He showed me an episode where the setting 'changed'. I said it was funny that I could read the plot for something and then picture it in my head. Ezra and I said it was the screenwriters fault for the setting change. We were then walking towards a building. The path lit up and was flashing and I said it was morse code. This guy in a car was playing drums and I started doing drumming motions in the air and was thinking that I needed to play Guitar Hero. I went up some stairs to get water from my room. It was pitch black so I used my phone light to see.
