[1997-07-08] We had a violent thunderstorm. Sammy has hated them ever since I got hurt by a firecracker. Any kind of loud clapping noise or banging noise like that. That low type sound bothers her. I was telling her to be a good girl and to stay on her rug, then we heard a really loud clap of thunder, the kind that sounds like it hit another object and it sounds like something might catch fire, its really loud and shakes everything and echoes through the air. Well, Sammy disobeyed me and leaped onto my bed, so I had about 70 pounds of dog on top of my stomach. I told her to get off my stomach, to get down, then she started to dig her little claws and paws into me to hold onto me. They were really sharp and it actually hurt a little bit. She wouldn't get down. I jerked awake to discover that it had been thundering and there was Sammy on top of my stomach and she wouldn't get down.
