I am now on a rocky hill. I see a white furry object and wonder what it could symbolize. I answer myself by saying it symbolizes mountains and ridges of anger, lots of anger. I agree that anger is important in my background. I see a group of people down on a beach, making love. I decide to go down there. I look for the path. Someone says, "Careful, it branches out and you could get lost." I go anyway and it's pretty much a straight path through the rocks. I get there and see Tyler walking beside me. He doesn't recognize me. I laugh and say, "I'm B." He is startled. I soothe him by saying, "It's easy to not know because I'm walking." I choose him and we make love. I'm glad it's someone I know and like.
