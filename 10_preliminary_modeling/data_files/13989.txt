Mom was going to let me have the day off school, but then Dad and Ezra pulled up at her house. Ezra stayed, but Dad left. We went to McDonald's to get food. Calvin was there and this other girl. I put my leg out and she almost tripped. I said "sorry, automatic reaction" and she said that it didn't even move and then some allusions to me being fat. This guy was singing and I was videoing it with my phone. Brianna took my phone because she wanted to do it. Later, the girl and along with Melodie and others were with me. She called me fat and I said "at least I don't look like you" and she said "you're ugly too". I said "I can lose weight, but you're stuck with that face" and that she "looks like a rat that has been hit in the face with a shovel 1700 times". She was Asian looking, with dark skin and was ugly. She looked at me incredulously. I was then threatening her with a butter knife. I asked Calvin to get me a sharper one and in a high pitched voice he said "a sharper one?". I got one myself and placed the point above her knee. I didn't think I would be able to stab her as it would be hard to get through and also that I would feel uncomfortable, but I stabbed her in the knee anyway and it went through easy and I felt fine. She screamed. I stabbed this pen too and the ink ran out into a bin. I tried not to get ink on my leaver's jacket. I planned to kill her but let the others go.
