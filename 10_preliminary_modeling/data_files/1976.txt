I'm walking down a road. I carry a small purse with pens in it. We are going to a party. The road goes through a house with rooms on each side. I am going downhill. It's like a hall. On the left a woman is bedridden. On the right are kitchen drawers. A small bird or two fly in. The woman in bed says, "They like to perch on the drawer knobs sometimes." I find the door to the party and open it up. A very steep stairway goes nearly straight down. I close the door, annoyed. I can't go. Then a woman says, "There's another way around the back." While she's clearing out stuff, I go find a bathroom. There are beds stored in there and the toilet is an adult-sized potty chair which has urine in it. I pee and it overflows. I stand up and now have a barrel stuck to my butt. It is dripping excess urine. I walk out into the hall, now wearing a robe to hide this mess. I hope no one notices.
