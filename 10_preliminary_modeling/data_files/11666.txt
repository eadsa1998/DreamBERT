In this dream I dreamt that I was walking along a path that was in a suburb and there was a river in the valley. I thought to myself I wish I had a fishing pole and I could go fishing. The scene shifted and I was wading along the river fishing with a flyrod. The river was very dirty and shallow where I was fishing and the bottom was very muddy and sticky. I saw how dirty the water was and decided that I would walk up the river and try to find deeper and cleaner water where I could fish. I walked along the river bank until I saw faster and clearer water. I reentered the river and began to fish again. I had no luck and was about to go further up river when I saw two fishermen coming down the river. They came up to me and I saw they were two friends of mine about 28 years old with whom I frequently go fishing. I asked them whether they had caught any fish and they answered yes. I asked them if they would give me some bait and they said it was all gone. It then began to rain and we began to run back to town. The path was very straight and lined with trees. We hardly got wet. It was lightning very hard when we got into town. A man drove past in a blue Chevrolet coupe and yelled.
