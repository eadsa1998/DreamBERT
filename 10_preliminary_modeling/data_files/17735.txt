My boyfriend Jeremy, my parents and I were playing a game.  My dad took a turn and had a goldfish floating by his head in a bubble of water.  On my turn I got a fish, too, in its own bubble of water- I was worried as the fish left the bubble of water, but was reassured when it simply swam to join my father's fish in its bubble.  The rest of the game seemed to be about donuts.  Some that appeared looked like baked potatoes and were rich with cream.  I looked forward to trying those.
