I'm testing my driving skills in the Buick with Laura at night. To see if I can be a bus driver. I dial 481-TIME to learn about the job. I drive very badly, nearly running into things. I park downtown and put things in my backpack in the car. Laura's with me. She digs through the change purse; she's going to get a treat. We walk around downtown (deserted) in the dark like that; it begins to rain. I show Laura how I wear my flannel over my backpack to protect it from rain. Now I'm in a class of some sort, with Mr. W, or somebody like him. The firebell rings and we all run outside. I pause a few minutes to select the writing tablet with the most paper to bring with me. Outside, the teacher gives a lecture on how to prepare the minimum writing supplies for use in fires and earthquakes. I don't listen to him. I think he's a fucker. Back downtown where I left off with Laura, I put my backpack in the back seat of the Buick as it starts to rain harder, and get in the driver's seat. I pull out onto West street and nearly hit a car in front of me; I swerve and go through the intersection. I can't find the brake fast enough to stop before the intersection at Main, so I glide through, find the brake, and pull the car to a halt at the left turn signal. Laura says: "God, David, you need practice." <br/
