I dreamt that I was at the camp where I worked last summer, but two girls from school were there with me. There seemed to be a series of secret passages around the camp, and I was always running from something through them. Although I knew someone was after me, I was not sure who it was, so I was never sure whom I could trust. I also had the feeling that I had to get back to town. When the phone rang, I answered it and someone asked for me. Just as I was about to speak again, one of the other girls from school answered on another extension and said that I was not there. At this I became more frightened and didn't know where to turn.
