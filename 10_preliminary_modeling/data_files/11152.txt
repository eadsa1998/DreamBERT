Last night I dreamed I was in a garage which was on an incline. Parked in the garage was a Cadillac convertible. It was blue. There was a hose on the floor and I remember picking it up and spraying water all over the car. I can still see the water hitting the car and spraying back on me and the floor. My father came into the garage and said that wasn't the right way to wash a car. Dad said I should stand closer with my finger over the nozzle of the hose and wipe the water and the dirt off with a rag. When he left the garage, I went back to the former way I had been doing it. All of a sudden the convertible top opened a little and I squirted water into the inside of the car. I remember I felt suddenly frightened and tried wiping up the water.
