I woke up and I could hear Mom giggling, like 'stop it'. Then she started moaning and saying "don't stop moving", and then finished off. I was grossed out by it. I turned around to go back to sleep. I had a bag with me and chipped the wall. Something had a kebab thing in it and there was mayonnaise and it was on my bed. There was a video of a Paul McCartney concert and this guy was in the audience looking bored.
