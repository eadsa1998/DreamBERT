I left my boyfriend Jeremy for a moment and got stuck talking to my old annoying roommate Chelsea.  Jeremy was in a convertible and was going to give someone a ride.  They pulled out and I started to run after them.  Jeremy started to laugh.  He held up his thumb and his pinky, and I tried to flip him off.
