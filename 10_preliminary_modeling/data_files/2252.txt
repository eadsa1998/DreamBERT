Joseph and I are going to dance (Indian dance like at a pow-wow). But in order for him to teach me, we need to find a sharp straight edge at a 45 degree angle. Then I see two woven baskets and I am working on unraveling a third so I can rebuild it well. Someone asks if I can sell one, but I say, "No. Sorry. They're all gone."
