I was watching this Little Britain show with Dad and Ezra. Matt Lucas was announcing and said that this was just a practice. This guy next to us had gone to some show that Dad had been to before. Michelle Rodriguez was around and Ezra said something about "the girl from Lost" and she came up and gave him $600. She came back later and showed him off to the crowd. She gave me $10000, and was going to give me $10000 each year.
