I was playing World of Warcraft and it was different. I was with someone else. I went to an area that was a higher level than me. We crossed an oval and it was 'night' and all mobs were asleep. We got to a temple and they were all asleep over the stairs and ground etc. We ran through the temple. I went up the stairs and found nothing and went down and through a door. They woke up and people started to shoot. I ran through and everyone was dead. I got to the end of the building and someone jumped into this little blimp like thing. Then the good guys came and they were in SWAT uniforms. Kim Raver was the leader.
