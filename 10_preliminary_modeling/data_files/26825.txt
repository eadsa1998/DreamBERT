 I'm about to eat dinner. I look in a refrigerator case. There are some loaves of bread in it. Some of the bread comes with meat: it looks like two small loaves of bread with a clump of sliced meat in between them. There is one loaf of bread for 35 cents. It is from the 36-hour famine. It looks good to me: it's a big, long loaf of soft white bread. I grab one bottle of beer out of the refrigerator. Others are eating with me. I think of getting a beer for each of us: that would be a nice thing for me to do. My old flat mate Glen Ryan and my coworker Herald Jamison are there. <br/
