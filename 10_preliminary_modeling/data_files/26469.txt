 I'm in a room with my friend Jack Thigpen and a woman. She talks to Jack harshly, criticizing and reprimanding him. She turns to me and says something. I reply harshly, "Get the fuck out!" She leaves the house. I turn to Jack and ask if he is seeing this woman. He says yes and makes a comment about the first fight in a relationship. It seems he is not taking it too seriously. I am appalled by this woman's bitchy attitude, and am ready to kick her out. Jack perseveres: he'll continue to see her despite this. I need to buy some groceries. I want to go to a big store. Jack needs to pick up a few things as well. I think we should go together, but I think we want to go to different stores: I think he'll want to go to a smaller, convenient store. I'm in a convenience store with Jack and others. We may buy a few things. I don't know if I should buy there. I'm outside the store on a sidewalk with dirt around. I see many coins, and start picking them up off the ground. They are Australian coins. I find a huge handful, and there are many more. They are covered in dirt. I pick them out, getting soil under my fingernails and on my hand. Some of the coins are large $.50 coins, and some are the small, octagonal $2 coins. I don't want anyone to see me picking up all these coins. I pick a handful up and may come back for more.
