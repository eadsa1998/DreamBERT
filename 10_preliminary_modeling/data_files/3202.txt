Now I am back at the apartment and the teen daughter returns. It is Lydia's "daughter" and Lydia was the woman I had shot, sort of. The daughter is being evasive and I suspect she has taken drugs. We, the woman and I, pick her up as she fights us, and take her to the emergency room. She insists she's fine and hasn't taken drugs. Again we go to the emergency room. We follow the nurse down the hall to a five-bed ward. We choose a bed for her to rest in. I look the room over and decide we chose the right bed after all. The other one by the door is also right by where they put the empty garbage cans and a noisy garbage truck works near there. The doctor comes over and does a test and says she has traces of board and other elements that indicate she has taken drugs. Board is a material that is in some drug as a filler. So now we can take her home. I sit her up in a chair ready to carry her home and I say to her, "You better listen girl, the third times the charm. You do this another time and you will not be rescued. We won't do it again. You will have to suffer the consequences. We mean it, too."
