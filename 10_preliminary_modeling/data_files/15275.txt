I was at Nana's, in the dining room (with the bookshelves). She said Dad and Poppa were going to buy a car for me and I saw it drive up. It was small, but white old and only had one seat. It cost $12,000. I said I didn't like it or want it. There was a giant easter egg, in the shape of a bunny. Bryson and Aunt Sally came in. Then there was this 'good' monster, like a giant lizard robot. There was a bad robot too. It shot lasers out of its eyes and we shot at them. I hid in a level 1 room with some others. I ran out and looked around for the robot, but couldn't see it. I said we had to leave now as I ran back in. We went through this other door and we were now up high. We had to walk down and and we were wobbly and had to keep our balance. We eventually got back down. I saw the lizard and a guy went over to attack.
