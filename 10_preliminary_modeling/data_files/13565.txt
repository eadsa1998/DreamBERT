I was watching an episode of The Outer Limits. Frank Whaley was in it. He and this guy were friends and he always took this bus. He was worried about a white light. These people were after him and to go to him, I had to go through the aisles of a video shop. One of the times I grabbed some movies and one of them was Invasion of the Body Snatchers with Donald Sutherland. This guy said something and I said "Yeah, it's the remake". One day we were riding the bus and it was weird. I tried to get over to Frank, but I fell into a seat nearby. This guy was talking to him across the bus. I went into the seat next to him and he held my hand. An impression of a monkey's face appeared in the seat in front of him. We looked at each other worried and then there was a bright light and then he was gone. It had happened to someone before. The other guy got off and was in a crowded area. His face turned monkey-like and people started screaming. Then I was watching this other episode and this girl and some other people were jumping off this bridge, but they didn't get hit by cars and landed in this gymnastic area. Her sister was naked and kept having hallucinations.
