I am flying into outer space; no space ship, just my body. I land on a planet. There are bad creatures there like zombies that take over your body. Some of the people are already taken over and you don't know which one is which. One is coming after me. He's got a ray gun and starts to pour purple rays into me. I fire back. He laughs. It won't hurt him. "You might as well give up," he smirks. I increase the rays, but he only laughs more. Suddenly I slow the pulses of the rays down. Now he's in trouble. He falls, stunned. I pick him up and slam him time after time against the ground, which finally kills him. Now I'm another person watching and I say, "Take his gun." We go into the jungle, uphill. Many other people are there too. I say to my companion, "Lots of them are the enemy already. For all I know you may be too. If you make any funny moves, you are dead." We walk carefully up the hill through the jungle.
