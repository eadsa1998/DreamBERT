There was post office work in Dill's and Ann was working there. They were going to build a building for the post office. We were looking at the plowed field that was the site for the building. Mr. Duke was in some organization. It was like about sex relations. My wife was also a member and they had her read for them because she was such a good reader. I was flying. I could fly so gracefully I would work my arms like wings and flew in Rivertown. I seemed to hear 6-6-6 repeated three times.
