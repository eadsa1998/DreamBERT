We got a telephone call to go to St. Andrews Hall. They had a party there and the lady said for Ann and I to come down. They had whiskey and pop left. So we went. Ann sat on a chair by herself and some women sat on the other side. Barbara went to sit with the women. I picked up a chair and sat beside Ann. A little girl dressed in white was on her way to the party. We went inside and there was whiskey and pop. I got a large glass, double header glass full of whiskey. I spilled it into the sink and rinsed it out. I put some whiskey and coke and water, then milk into a glass and I drank it and it was good. It really went down and the whiskey was not sharp. We sat outside and all at once heavy black; some came our way and it had a bad odor. The smoke cleared and I saw a fire. They were burning off old cable. A fellow asked me how high the smokestacks were. They were about a mile away. I took a good look at them and there was a ladder leaning on one of them and it reached to the top. I told the boy the stacks were about 250 ft. high. I looked into the sky and I saw two planes flying. They looked like two planes. They bumped and one fell to the earth. I saw a lot of seagulls flying. They were from the Figi Islands. A dog made a big jump and fell flat when he dropped.
