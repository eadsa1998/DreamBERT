A man wants to make love with me and is flirting. I am haughty and annoyed. He pulls me to him and I suddenly realize I want to make love. I then tell him to meet me at the barn. I go there and wait in the hay loft. He shows up hours later with his guy friends to make fun of me. I hide under hay and behind a pole in a small square hole with hay bales around me. He nearly steps on me and then leaves. I go to the river and swim, naked and sensuous as he watches enviously.
