I had taken a friend of mine to see the secret passageway in the house. We went up the stairs. I led the way. When we came to the top of the stairs, I turned to the ledge which led to the secret passage down through the house to the basement. On the ledge there were two silver blue foxes sitting in front of the entrance to the passage. They would not let us enter the passage, so we went downstairs. The friend was a cadet officer in ROTC and was in uniform. I do not know who he was as his face was indistinct.
