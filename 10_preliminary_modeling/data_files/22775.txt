I was in the house where I used to live before this one, all of us were there, including my father. It was around 10 a.m., somewhat late, because it seems that we had had a late night and we were all in pajamas. We were very happy. It was my brother's birthday (he is three years older than I, 24). My stepbrother, on my father's side, was there (he is married and has a family). I saw he had blue pajamas on, but the top was too short for him. It was a Saturday and when we were having breakfast, they knocked on the door and nobody wanted to open it. We all told my brother whose birthday it was to open, but he didn't want to because he was not well dressed. Since it was Saturday, my brother and I wanted to go out, but it seems that my father said that only one of us could go out and the other should stay. I felt I was going to win and that my father was letting me decide and I felt a strange sensation. I don't know how to explain it; it was like a disappointment or anger, I don't know. I wasn't happy.
