I was in the water.  I had gone out a ways from shore and was swimming back to where some people I knew were swimming.  I recognized Carole Warner.  I thought I also recognized Max Ardol, and I started to playfully slap him on the butt with my flip flop, but then I realized it wasn't him.  Carole Warner was pregnant, and this apparently was her boyfriend-Jim something.
