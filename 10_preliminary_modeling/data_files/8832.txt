Jo V and Jan F were here. They stopped by on their way home or on their way somewhere. I left them sitting alone in the living room and I kept going in another room to do something. I asked them if they had eaten yet. When they said they hadn't, I invited them to stay for dinner. Jo V seemed a bit hesitant but agreed. I just went back to what I was doing instead of taking care of dinner. I guess I thought what I was doing wouldn't take long and then I would go fix dinner. After awhile I went back into the living room and Jo V said they were getting ready to leave. I asked about dinner. I could tell she was a bit put off that I was not visiting with them. Then she said they would stay for dinner if it was going to be very soon because they needed to get going.
