My cousin and two of her friends had come to visit from Vermont. A six-year old girl came with them. They knocked on the door and me and my mom were only expecting my cousin, but since her friends had come all the way from Vermont my mom said it was okay that they could stay. I showed all four of them a tour of my house. After I showed them to my room and we stayed there for a while, we decided to play a board game. I showed them all my board games. They chose Mouse Trap. When I picked up the box we turned into comics in a comic strip with a writer. Setting: We started out inside of my house in my room, and then we were in a comic strip. Characters: My mom, my cousin Anne, I don't know her two friends, Wendy was the six-year old girl from my school, and I did not know who the writer of the comic strip was. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, worried. When my cousin's friends and her came I was really happy, but when we were in a comic strip I was scared and worried about my mom.
