I was at a shop and someone was filming. I was in the background of the video. It sped up and so we had to do something. I was then sitting with someone in a car. This angry guy got in and took off. It was like an expensive, fast car and he had put his foot right down. I was like "I hope you're a good driver!" and then he crashed into a lake. It wasn't actually a lake, and it had like paths surrounding it. The car was yellow by the way. I held my arm up out of the water holding my phone. I took a photo with it. I swam to the other side with one arm. Poppa was there and helped me up. I had text Dad saying "it had [something]. Do you know guys with ebay?" and something else that I can't read. The guy got out and was shaken up. Mom and Ezra came. Ezra said something about the picture, I think but I can't read what I've written. There was a mention of a drive in the past week when Mom and I had crashed into the same river/thing. Later, I went for a drive with Mom to this place in a really dodgy neighbourhood with gangs and stuff. I saw some gangster girls and I said I wanted to leave so we did. Then I was doing a quest and I had to break into some girl's house. I got in and pressed a button on a remote and then I had to find photos. I was searching through the wallet. Someone was coming and we left. Then I was some guy and the son of a famous guy was in a field. I can't read the other bit it says. I had to change. There was something about The Matrix?
