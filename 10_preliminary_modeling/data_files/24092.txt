This is as close to a recurrent dream as any. I have had this dream maybe twice a year for the last 4 years √ê always a similar dream but slightly different than this one. I wake up in the morning and I am really excited to go surfing. It is sunny and I know the waves must be really good. Friends are waiting for me to pick them up but when I got to get my surfboard, I cannot even find it. I kind of assume that my dad hid it somewhere because he thinks surfing is a waste of time. I look all around the house (my parent's house) and I finally find it. The board is broken in half and is totally unrideable. For some reason I think my dad must have broken it. I am pissed off, but I know it is pointless to ask him about it because there is no such thing as a rational conversation with him. There is nothing I can do, so I just shake my dad and think how fucked up this situation is.
