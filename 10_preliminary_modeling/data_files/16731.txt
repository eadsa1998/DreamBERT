Somebody's baby was in my kitchen. I was really excited and tried to teach him to become self-conscious- touching my nose and hoping he'd do the same, for example, and just imagining how smart he'd be when he got older. Then I remember Clarissa yelling at me for not getting my work done in this project we were supposedly doing (for physics?). Jamie was standing there, very innocent looking, while my brother was "trying to profit from the naivety of certain store clerks." I was complaining to my mother, trying to get her to stop worrying about a problem she was having with the computer (which I recognized as being not a big deal at all). Jamie is still standing here, by the way. So I just turned the computer off on her, and she was complaining that she wouldn't be able to get the weather now. I tried to explain that if she was lost with a street map, she'd still have to check the internet for a map. Anyway, now I'm somewhere else, and I hear a supposedly old Barenaked Ladies song that I've never heard before. Anyway, I wanted to go for a walk with Jamie to hang out with her and tell her something, but I never got the chance.
