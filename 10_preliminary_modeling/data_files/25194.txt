 I'm at a swimming pool with my friend Tiny Combs. There is a whirlpool there too. I'm going in the pool. I see the management from a grocery store I used to work at, going into the whirlpool. Among them are Mike Johnson, Larry Paulson, and Dan Drummond. They are wearing only shorts. I walk by. It is crowded going from the whirlpool to the pool. My childhood friend Tim Robbins and his mother Mary are sitting in the whirlpool. I have to step carefully to get through the crowd. I say excuse me. The pool is relatively empty when we get to it.
