I can't place this dream well, but I saw myself trying to get our pickup truck ready, and I saw my oldest sister coming and telling about some tragedy and she asked my brother to take her to Huancayo because she was running away from home because her husband had wanted to take her son away from her. I remember that she said she had taken all her savings out of the bank and that she could live from that until the situation became normal again. She asked my mother to tell my father, when he arrived, to write a letter of recommendation for her so that she would be hired as a referee in boxing matches, since she knew about that. My brother started to get the truck ready for the trip, but she told him that the roads were blocked and the police were looking for her, and that they would only let trucks with animals go by. So we had to get some pigs there and hide the suitcases, and my nephew among them. My mother was running to and fro, carrying blankets to give to my sister so that she would not be cold during the trip. My brother was running around, I saw him in shirtsleeves, and when he already was starting up, my mother handed him a sweater and asked him if he had enough money for gas, and he said he had $50.00 and that my father could pay him later, since he was not there at the time. And the dream was interrupted at this point.
