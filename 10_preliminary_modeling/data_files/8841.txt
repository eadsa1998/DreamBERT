Darren and I were still married. Someone we knew was going on a trip and they asked him to watch their four cats while they were way. Darren agreed to do this and I was very upset about that because he knows that I am allergic to some cats and very allergic to some. He is, and he had agreed to take care of them in our home while they were away. After a few days, I could hardly take it anymore. I finally told him that he had to do something about this that those cats could not be there anymore. So he decided to kill them. Then he decided that he would only kill two of them. Or at least that's what he told me. He said he was going to keep one of them, because it looked exactly like the owners fifth cat, which we didn't have with us. I don't know why they only gave us for the cats though, to watch while they were gone. We had some friends over for dinner one evening, and as we were having dinner Darren asked us if we were enjoying it, because he had fixed it. Just as he asked as we all happen to be taking a bite of the meat that he had prepared. He asked us if we knew what it was and we all said that we didn't. He then proceeded to tell us that he had killed the third cat and that is what we were eating. We called immediately spit it out on our plate. I felt like I was going to be sick. I simply couldn't believe that he would do that. Everyone seemed horrified that he had done that, or at least that he would cook a cat for people to eat.
