The Queen and the rest of the royal family were staying at Target. I was in there for some reason and talking to Harry and for some reason we liked each other so he asked me to stay too. I can't remember the exact details, but I met the Queen and was just casual with her. Later, someone had planted a bomb. I got out and ran and got in a car and drove off and then in the background this massive store collapsed.
