I dreamt I was in another planet, fighting against its inhabitants (it was truly a disagreeable dream). The floor of that planet was multicolored and had a jello-like consistency in some parts and a compact consistency in others. At the beginning it was I alone who fought those beings of green faces and shining eyes, but then other earthlings who came to help me appeared. I am going to try to describe how the fight went: the strange creatures had set a goal mark for us; if we reached it, they would pardon our lives, but we were on the losing side anyway because we did not know how to reach the goal mark, which was an enormous building at the end of a corridor. The creatures chased us continuously with their weapons; they shot one of my comrades, and when he was hurt, he began to sink into the floor and was finally swallowed by it. They continued shooting their strange weapons and we started to do the same. They almost got me, but fortunately I was saved. Afterwards I had gotten to the house of an old lady (of unknown features) to ask her to let me use her bathroom, and then to rest a while. The lady looked at me suspiciously and hardly let me use her bathroom. When I came out of the bathroom, she accused me of having stolen her treasure and she would not let me go. I don't know how I escaped, but I then found myself again fighting with the strange creatures. Among the people who were with me, I did not recognize any friends or acquaintances.
