I was in Red Dwarf and it was sometimes just me, but sometimes me, Lister, Cat and Kryten. It was very boring when I was alone. With the others, I found a thing to travel back in time and we went to Rimmer. He was packing stuff away and I said "Rimmer" and he looked at me and I told him what to do that day so he wouldn't die. Then he was with us in the present. Lister said to me 'you brought back Rimmer?'.
