[The Post Office Adventure] A man and his wife, another man, and I (all strangers) were on walk just outside of Post Office. The men were middle-aged, and one of them had only 1 arm. both had evidently forgotten something (they had just left P.O.) and wished to re-enter. The man with 2 arms leaned on my shoulder and told a tragic story about his forgetfulness. The one with 1 arm was rather pugnacious and seemed to go out of his way in order to push and elbow me out of his path. A fist fight seemed imminent. Next, I was inside Post Office, standing at a writing table. The room was crowded with people, and an attendant (believe he was colored) pulled shades on front windows and doors to indicate the office was closed and thus keep out other people. Official closing time was 1:30 p.m. and about half hour till that time. I was filling out a form which seemed to be on a sheet of thin wood, the letters being either raised or cut in. The form was from some company offering to buy poems, songs, etc. I was confident that the (?poem) I had in mind would bring $1.00 or $2.00, but finally decided not to send it in until later, when it would be perfected and worth considerably more.
