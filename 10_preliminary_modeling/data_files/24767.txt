I only remember a tiny bit of this big long dream. I washed my hair with this shampoo and it gave my hair a reddish tinge, and I liked the way it looked a lot. Some of my friends were in the dream. Setting: I don't remember. Characters: Me and some friends. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy. I washed my hair last night and I saw a friend of my mom's who had red streaked hair and it looked really pretty.
