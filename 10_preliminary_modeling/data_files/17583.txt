Something about Bailey's Irish Cream.  Then a place with many spiders.  One was about two feet long, another was about half that, and several were about _ of an inch.  There were spider webs all over.  I had to be protected.  Later, my father got mad at me because I brought him food without asking.  He said he's getting closer to 61 and needs to get in shape.  I tried to leave for class but Kirstie Alley stopped and molested me.  Then I parked a car on the left side of the street.
