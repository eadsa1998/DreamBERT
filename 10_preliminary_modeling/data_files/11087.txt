At first it seemed I was flying along in the air, although not very far off the ground. I looked down and there was a high cliff with a canyon below. I got scared and couldn't fly anymore and I had that feeling of falling a long distance. Then I walked out of my house and saw my uncle's car in front. I got in and stepped on something soft and furry. When I looked down, I saw a tiger lying on the floor of the car and I was scared again.
