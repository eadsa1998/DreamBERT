 I'm selling Christmas trees in what seems to be the St. Mary's Church parking lot. A man comes and wants to buy two trees, but he only has enough money for one tree. I am selling them for $8.00 each. There are people in trucks that are stealing all the trees. There is a fight. People are wounded. I kill the dying people. My basketball teammate from high school Chad Owens is there. The owner of the tree lot comes and turns on the lights and the music. A nice black man comes, and I tell him that this is not a good time.
