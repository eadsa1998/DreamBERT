I am F. Hayward and John Wayne and I are very attracted to each other. We want to be touching and physically close all the time. Meanwhile I have a difficult boss. I am about to be fired. I work hard and I feel bad. "This is the second job where I got fired unjustly," I say to the snooty secretary. I want to explain my side to the boss. Now somehow I've created or am creating a movie. The boss is now the director or producer. He comes in and I tell him in a firm tone that he will ruin everything if he continues to use that authoritarian voice and lectures at the crew all the time. He must learn to listen, listen, listen well. John Wayne is standing by me ready to defend me or protect me. Now I look out the window and I see men swimming toward the very ritzy mansion I live in. I see a sailing boat, only it seems to be metal, like "Old Ironsides" with red running lights. I am the isolated hostess throwing a party for the people who have rejected me. I hope they will come. But I'm not sure they understood my side of the story. I wait, hopefully. Now these men are coming to the party to help back me up. I am pleased. The night is dark and the waters are dark. John Wayne had gone out and convinced them of my innocence. Now I see two women in evening dress approaching my front steps. They are hesitant, unsure if they should trust me. I encourage them to come in. Now the people come and we have a wonderful, happy party with dancing and music. I am wearing a beautiful flowing evening dress, of a 1940's or 50's vintage. John Wayne and I dance in anticipation of being alone to make wonderful passionate love. I am exonerated.
