I was at my first lesson of chemistry which I only had on Tuesdays in the lab. It was in a different place. I got into a mixed group. There was a guy teacher and he was pretty lame. He yelled at me for not having my safety glasses and I yelled back that it didn't say to get any. He told this guy with long hair to tie it up. Later, we had started and then he told me and this girl that we needed to tie our hair up. I said no and he went off at me, mentioning the glasses again, and that I was just standing around. I yelled back and started to cry and grabbed my stuff and left. I was walking quickly down the corridors outside (the place was different) and I saw Regina. She said hello and that she didn't get into the course she wanted and had to do another unit. I wiped my tears away and said "what, you have to dance on stage or something?". She said that Samantha was showing her around and left. I came back later with Dad and it was either Wednesday or Thursday. I had to go back to chemistry though. I saw Ms Ingram and Ms Kuo. Ms Ingram gave me a skirt and said to try it on and this guy told me not to worry about it. I got to class and the group from chemistry saw me and they were annoyed and trying not to smirk. I asked for my results. Some time later, Calvin and some other people were playing a game. Silas was in a cave? Calvin had peed down there and told Silas that. He didn't believe him and I said it was true and he realized it was and vomited. There was a show, which was in book form too. It was romance and the guy looked like Michael Emerson and the girl thought he was "cute".
