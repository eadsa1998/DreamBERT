Three of us, two men and myself, are sitting in a library. Guy on my left is eating chocolate-covered Nabisco wafers. He goes to a shelf and puts one down, with a look at the third man, sitting to my right and across. I immediately get up and walk over to shelf where he put the wafer and I eat a mouthful with a look of assurance at the third man. I smile assuredness that I will leave some for him. I munch less than half the wafer and then walk over and hand the remaining morsel to him.
