 I go to a large building with my friends Bubba Hacker and Stephen Ramos. We're planning on sledding. There are many businesses in the building. I see a brand new Mountain Market deli being put in. There are also other shops around. I approach one of the supervisors of the soon-to-be deli. She asks me if I have permission to be going sledding. I say yes, I talked to a man in charge on the phone, and he gave me the okay. She doubts the authority of the man I spoke with while trying to determine exactly who it was. She wonders if the person I spoke with was female. I say no, he was male. We talk about work, and I tell her I'd be more than willing to work a day or two at this deli. I tell her to just call me for problems or questions. I walk away with a red plastic sled that has a pointed tip, in my hand. We walk in this mall-like area. A food court is on our left. There is a place that sells fresh fish, advertising Walleye, Northern Pike, and more. I think, who would want to eat northern pike? We're headed sledding, on a slanted area inside this new building, which is not fully finished off or occupied.
