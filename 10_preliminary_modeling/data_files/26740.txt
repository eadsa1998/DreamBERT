 There is a large cylindrical pit in the ground filled sparsely with bits of wood. There is a kind of contest occurring. At the bottom of the pit is a target. Each person makes a dot on a small paper target with concentric circles that I have. They then sign their name by their dot. I put a dot right in the middle. My old classmate Gino Teavor puts his dot near the second concentric circle near the center. I think that this is just like him, to put his dot so close to the center: he has always been fairly egocentric. My grade school friends Jerry Kasper, Eric Stoner, and Kory Reynolds also make dots and sign them. I'm playing cards with my brother Wally and my flat mate Bittie Marton. They talk about my venting my anger, saying either that I do or must, or that I don't very much. I get very mad and express my anger towards Wally. I'm belligerent and try to physically push him around. My friend Mark Long (who in real life is dead) is there. I have him write his new address in my address book. He now lives in Blooming Grove. I had crossed out the old address when he committed suicide.
