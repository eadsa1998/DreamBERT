["Do the dreamwork NOW."] I am packing to go somewhere for the weekend. Finally after all this time the dreams are ready for me to explore. I am excited. I pick up a box that has Benzonate cap and gravel looking pills. These could help my pain. I can't wait to get started on the dream work. It will help ease the pain.
