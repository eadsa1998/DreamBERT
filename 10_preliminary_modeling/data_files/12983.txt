I was at 'school'. Some others and I got caught by this evil Jack Nicholson dude. He made us lie down on our stomachs and he was going to infect us with some alien. When he wasn't looking, I ran. He started to chase after me, but this machine started up so he stayed with the other four. As I was running, I passed Ezra and some of his friends. I was running through the school and so many people were getting infected. There was a shop nearby and there were infected people there. The infected people were zombie-like but were Invasion of the Body Snatchers like and slowish at first. Then they were like the zombies in Dawn of the Dead original. Ezra and Clayton got infected. I ended up teaming up with some guy. Nana was at the shop and there was a photo of Dad on the wall. I was stabbing it because he was infected. I had tried stabbing a zombie but it didn't work. I told Nana not to talk to anyone and I left. I came back a while later and she was infected. This guy and I were at this shoe shop. We were hitting zombies with shoes and they were down with one hit. I was telling the guy to get shoes. We made a hide-out, in this little kitchen area with a curtain. I found his mother and she was infected. I told him and he was trying to talk to her. I saw Elijah and threw a shoe at his head and nothing happened. I said "oh, you need two hits!" and I threw another one and then realized he wasn't infected. Then, I was level 60 and I found this noob level 24 girl. She got some equipment from Red Rooster. We were going to this library to kill zombies. In the car park of this other shop there was a police car. Two policemen were in there, not infected and they were Scottish.
