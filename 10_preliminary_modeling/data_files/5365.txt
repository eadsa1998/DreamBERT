I dreamed that Hannah, Sue, and I were all going to a wedding on a farm. We didn't know what to wear, and Aidan kept stealing all our clothes anyway. I tried on all of my mother's clothes, and realized she had a lot of pretty silk Banana Republic dresses. But I couldn't wear those because I didn't have a bra. I had to go out into the garden and harvest a bra, since they grew from the ground, apparently. Then I woke up.
