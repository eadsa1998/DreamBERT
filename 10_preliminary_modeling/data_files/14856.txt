Noah (Heroes), but he was sometimes Tony (The Soprano's), had a spaceship and was selling it to some guy. They were at a restaurant thing. I was then there and we were in the corner with some guy and I was next to him. People came looking for him and he got up and left. I grabbed this bag and I went outside. It was night. Claire (Heroes) and I got into a light pink car. I locked the doors. We went to Tony's house which was weird and had pools out the front. Meadow (The Soprano's) was with us now and there was more than one of her. Claire and I were trying to keep the other ones out of sight. There was a birthday chart and Claire Fisher (Six Feet Under) was on there and she was only supposed to be twelve.
