George was in my interest. His body was so smooth - almost damp and hairless. I was in his apartment. He lived high up. A view shows the tops of three buildings with the blue sky - brilliant blue - in the back. They angle as though they are stretched through a 28mm lens. Old 1930 buildings. [George = acquaintance]
