 I'm with my roommate Stephen Ramos and friends Jimmy Youngman and Max Tide in a car. We're driving south down Home Avenue in Oak Valley. We turn right onto 1st Street, and then turn left on Park Avenue and pick up our friend Niles Zelling at the Hill's house. The guys tell stories about the time Max had sex with a woman, while seeing my friend Tina Totts at the same time. The woman's name was Bobby L. Mathers. I recognize the name as "The Beaver", and I laugh. Niles gets in the car. He talks about how his sister used the word "nigger", and behaves as if he is angry with her. I remember recently when I reprimanded him for saying the same thing. He was trying to convince others and I that he wouldn't use that word.
