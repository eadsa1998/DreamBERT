It was in the middle of the day in the dream and I had just woken up from a nap. I was in a cabin at a camp. I went outside and all the counselors were sitting outside on a picnic table. The counselors were my friends√ëonly about 15 years older, and I was older also. We were all counselors and everyone was really happy. My friends are guys and girls. During the entire dream I was really happy and had this really weird floating feeling, like I was on a cloud. I woke up from the dream feeling really happy, relaxed and just really good.
