I was in Mexico, some border town, like Nogales I think. The streets were dark. It felt dangerous. I knew that drug runners and gangsters were near and running around, and I was a little scared. I saw Tania (from Pasta Jay's), and went to her. The area was a street, but there was construction or ruin around. There were big blocks of concrete, barbed wire fencing, and concertina wire.  When I was near Tania, I felt less scared. Tania pointed to an opening between or above some blocks of concrete, and I saw a huge bluebird looking at us. He was enormous, like twice the size of me. And he was looking straight at us and conscious of us. His expression was quizzical. Tania said "he wants to kiss you." And I jumped up, climbed on a piece of concrete, went toward him, and said "I want to kiss the bluebird!"  I was eager to, I felt like this was a really unusual occurrence, so magical, mystical even, and that the connection would change me forever. I put my face close to his and his huge eye was looking at me as I kissed him.
