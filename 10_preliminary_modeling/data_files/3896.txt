["Annoying man in sail boat."] I am in a tiny sail boat. I had to swim to it. A woman and her grown son and another woman are on the boat. I must get in or I will drown. I fear sharks are in the water and scramble aboard. It is so small that when we all four lie down to sleep, we cover the entire boat. I am semi-curled up. The man is interested in me sexually so he lies with his fgace near me. He keeps trying to squirm closer. I try to ignore him and I am annoyed. Finally I move my face away and make it clear his advances aren't wanted. That doesn't stop him of course. Now the other woman is Kyle and he goes overboard to go to the bathroom. I suggest the other man do that too. He does, but he isn't happy about it.
