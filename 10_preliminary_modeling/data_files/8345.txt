I was giving a dream workshop that involved some type of artwork - drawing. The response was very positive. I had said something about the pen I was using. Afterwards the person who had hired me said she would like to go ahead and get the pens for everyone - I had apparently quoted her to include them but she opted out. I reminded her that she had opted out and as such not paid for them, so the additional fee would be around $1,000. They were about $1 each, personalized, and she needed 1,000. She didn't answer me but I had the sense that she needed to think about it or that she really didn't want to buy them, having been reminded of the price. One of the attendees came up to me afterwards and asked me how I learned to draw. She asked me if I see what I am drawing or if I just see lines. I pointed to an individual as an example and said, I look at her face. I simply look at the lines of her face, such as the lines of her nose, her hair, etc. She asked me if I could recommend some books that would help her get started. I was hesitant to tell her about the books that I used because I had bought them used at the Half Price Books store. I thought I might tell her that my books are very old and were given to me by someone. In my head I was justifying the lie by telling myself they were a gift - from me to me. I don't think I ever answered her however.
