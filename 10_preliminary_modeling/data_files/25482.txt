 I'm at a party with a large group of people including my friends Norman Noman and Holly Lapson. Someone talks about a Boeing 757. Norman is uneasy about flying on a 757. I say to him that he must have flown in a 757 before in one of his flights to school from his home in Seattle. I tell him I'll sit next to him and I'll take the window seat. There are people with rice crispy bars and other cereal bars.
