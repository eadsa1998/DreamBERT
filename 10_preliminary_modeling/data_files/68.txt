I'm with a group of people together for a purpose - we're going out for lunch break and drive to a restaurant (or go in a van provided by the restaurant) that we'd been "sold" on by this Mexican woman - it's further than I imagined it would be, and when we get there it doesn't look like one. It's through a house, and the house is high off the street. Bit of a climb to get there, then we all get led into the house. A room we go through is very uneven - there are steps in it, different places. I'm lagging behind the others, and so is another woman - we have a kind of familiarity - some similar experiences that we talk about, something to do with this room.
