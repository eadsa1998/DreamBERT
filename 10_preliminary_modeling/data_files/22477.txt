I was in a room in house with a little girl of about 5 who had long hair and was named the same as another one I know, but it wasn't her and neither were her parents. I couldn't see her face. They had small crocodile, but it was the size of a monkey and had the face of a baby. We had to avoid his biting the girl and we kept him running from one place to another. We locked ourselves in a room, but the bottom part of the door didn't close well. To stop him from getting in, we put pillows and they sat on them. The animal was starting to push them. Then I took the girl out through a window that led to a small patio. The animal, seeing that she wasn't inside, turned around and went into the patio and then I put the girl back in the room, but she couldn't get down. She had stayed on a cement wall. I was amazed....
