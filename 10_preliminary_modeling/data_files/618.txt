I go somewhere and leave my youngest children, a boy and girl, alone. When I get back I don't look for the girl right away and realize later that she is gone. I look all over outside. The land is kind of swampy. I look under a train. I remember she was wearing a blue net top. She comes back but I am not sure it is her. I take her to a local styling salon to get her hair done and tell the stylist to give her a different hair do because she is different and I need to get used to different.
