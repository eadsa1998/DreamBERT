["Soft sweet flavors and sweet emotions."] I am in a cafe sitting in seats like in school. A waitress sits on my left. I am trying to write her a complement letter. Dear "One" as in Number one. I write. Then I can't think of anything more to say. Another woman reads and copies a paper I have there, a form. She feels embarrassed and hands it back. A group of women are getting ready to go outside for a little tour walk. I am going to join them. A pudgy short man, a "director" comes in and I pick up a flower design off a cow and sniff it. He does too. It is sweet and delicious. Together we begin to explore as we go on this tour walk and share our delightful flavors and smells with each other. A sweet tender friendship quickly forms. We agree to continue this together after the tour. I accidentally hug him. I am so happy with this connection. Our plump fronts touch and we feel embarrassed and look away. I pull back. Now we leave the tour to go on our own to the next taste treat. Somehow it never happens. His male friends tease him about how silly it is and we sadly separate. I see the women's group going in and I hesitate. Maybe I'll follow them in. I wait hopefully for the good soft warm feelings to return, but it all slowly evaporates.
