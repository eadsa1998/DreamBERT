I am invited to go to a concert by my friend Chloe But then we are at their house in M. City (they live 3 blocks from us). It is Sunday, but I arrange a tennis game for one of Zena's boyfriends; he plays very poorly. I go back to our house. Reynaldo has been redecorating our floors and our ceilings. Chloe is waiting for me in her car and wants me to sit in the front seat; I carry two bowls with salad and a hot dish. shift: It is Sunday and there is a Liturgy at Church: Before the reading of the Epistle, I go to sit in the front; I have taken off my T-shirt and am naked at the top. The choir director tells me to put on some clothes; I did not feel any guilt. Now the service continues with our organist showing us slides of the Milky way. As he does so, he leans over the railing of the Choir Loft and leans forward and forward, until he falls, to the ground, BUT DOES NOT HURT HIMSELF.
