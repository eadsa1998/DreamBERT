A boy on couch, wrestling with him. "Do you play tennis?" "I'd like to play with you and let myself be defeated." I wrestle with him on the couch, laughing and talking about the members of his family (brother no good; sister in another city.) -- Also scene of walking down stairs, telling him how to say "DOBRY DEN" (Good morning) in Czech.
