 I'm sitting near my advisor Mary Monroe and another professor named Jim Ryan. Jim makes a comment involving the word 'boy' or 'boys', and a few other ideas. I verbally attack him, saying, "What the fuck are you talking about!?" As soon as I do this I realize that everyone that has heard me is indignant: my language was offensive. I feel guilty for crossing this social boundary. I try to rephrase my words in a way that is equally as firm and harshly critical but not as offensive. My uncle Rusty Redding is standing about 30 feet away talking with some people. He gets my attention to show me how people reacted when they heard my obscenities.
