Now there was an earlier dream tonight before this one, and which I'll just describe a little bit of, since it's all I recall. And in this, I was back in high school, although we were discussing sort of advanced topics. Sort of a combination of hypnotism, and I had started sort of a general discussion, and oh, a dozen people had expressed opinions or asked questions. And since I was supposed to be providing the information, I'd taken some notes on what these were so I could talk about it. And I stopped everybody and tried to reply to all these questions while I still could remember them reasonably well from my notes. Then I ended up in another corner of the room, sitting behind somebody who was talking very loudly, such that I couldn't hear what was going on and the other people couldn't hear me. And so I told him to be quiet, and he became quite belligerent, and slapped me. So I slapped him back. I sort of thought in the dream that this was a sign of maturity or something, since I could fight physical violence with physical violence, fight back without any fear, such as had always characterized me. And then there were some rather vague parts in this dream. One thing that strikes me is that I had to put on a pair of Bermuda shorts to go home, and the shorts very strange because they had four holes for legs. And there was a great deal of confusion in the dream as to whether these were male shorts or female shorts. But I eventually did get them on, first wondering whether to put my legs through the outside -- well, first I put my legs thru the inside pair of holes, but I thought the outside pants holes looked awfully funny, so then I put my legs thru the outside ones, and let the inside ones hang between my legs.
