I had a spider bite the size of a golf ball on my left shoulder blade.  My mother was talking to my paternal Grandma Fay's best friend Charlene (with brown hair) in the kitchen.  I went back and gave her a hug.  My maternal Grandma Jane followed me into my room to look at the bite.  A huge spider with a ~2 inch body and thick legs appeared near the closet.  It had a white spot and lines in a triangle formation.  My mother flicked at it.  She gripped it in a Kleenex and told Grandma Jane to squish the other half- it was too big for one person to do.  I was screaming in fear.
