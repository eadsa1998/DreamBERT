Father Andrew and a large group of people, not necessarily from Church, are assembling decals on a square prayer card.... I see stacks and stacks of them as well as on a large female doll, made out of cardboard, to be used at a Fair? I come in and try to help, but no one seems to make room for me, finally, I think, Father Andrew explains how to go about it and he gets up and lets me sit in his seat. (!) I start working... it is quite simple. There is much excitement in the room, and I wake up before I know what it is all about.... I think I also see some stained glass windows like in Church in Bisbee......
