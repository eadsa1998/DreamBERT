I went to work for a woman business owner. The job was something about presenting programs to groups. I was talking to one of her employees about ADHD and how it affects your life. We thought it would be a great idea to market a program about ADD, educating people about signs and symptoms, treatment, living with ADD, how people with ADD are treated by others. The owner of the business liked the idea. She said the other employee could do all the clerical work and I could just do the presenting. I told her I thought it would be a full-time job so why not build enough into the cost of the program to pay me as a full-time employee and let me handle most of that: registration calls, set arrangements, etc. I think she agreed. I told her I had a voice mail only number that we could use and that I would put together a business plan. She didn't seem to see a need for a business plan. Her other employee wanted to try my meds for ADD. They both wanted to get something to drink first. Then I gave her one _ pill, telling her that's all she should take. I broke one in half with my fingernail. They said something about me using my fingernail. I commented how tough my nails are. The employee said something about using Sally Hansen products on her nails. I turned around and said I do too. Then I saw she had Sally Hansen products lined along her desk. I said, I use, then went to the desk to try to find the one I use and picking it up as I finished the sentence, saying NuNail. I then realized how short my nails were at that time so I explained that I often have to cut them down because they get too long or if I break two or more off below the quick I cut them all down so they look even.
