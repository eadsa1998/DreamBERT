My dream was really weird last night. First I was living in an apartment with 4 other girls and 5 other guys. I was trying to make everyone go to sleep, but Jessica had a tennis match and was making a lot of noise. Then there was another guy with long dirty blonde hair, sort of like a California surfer. I guess we had been dating for a while. He was hugging me and saying, "I'm surprised I haven't broken you yet." And I got really scared because I did not want to be with him. I suggested we make oatmeal (in order to distract him). He poured his down the sink, which hurt my feelings for some reason. Finally, my father, my mother, and I were all driving in New Haven, but my father couldn't drive properly, so my mother had to take over. Weird.
