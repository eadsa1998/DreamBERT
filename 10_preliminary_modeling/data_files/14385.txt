For university, I had been set up to live somewhere. I was at Nana's and there were six of us. I got the lounge room (now bare and a different shape). The other rooms being used were the dining room/other lounge and I think Nana's room. This other girl was in the other lounge room. Preston was sent to the dining room. Quinton (from math) was with me. I redecorated the room for myself but then remembered I was sharing. We had a small TV. My bed went to the edge of the bottom of the stairs and I couldn't think of how to move it to get it out of the way. Then I was at 'home'. My room was different and fairly empty. Someone came in with a baby and put it in a cot that was in my room. The room also had a door to the outside. I finished playing this game and I told Mom to get the baby out or I'd throw it out. I put all of the baby's stuff in the hall. We were going somewhere I think.
