 I'm in a grocery store shopping with my dad and sister Ramona. People shop in pairs here. My dad's friend Josh Hemming is there. My dad gets one 12-pack of 7-Up and of Sunkist. We split up. I go to get a cart. My dad says to meet here tomorrow in the produce section. I want to play a joke on him. I need to get my wallet back. I gave my whole wallet to someone, maybe a cashier, and have no way of getting it back. I should have just given them a form of identification or a credit card. I have a till that is being used. I want it back. I don't want to buy anything. The till is in the express lane.
