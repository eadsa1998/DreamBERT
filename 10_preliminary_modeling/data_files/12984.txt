I went to some takeaway place. Mom ordered this thing with spinach and cheese. They gave her something else. I threw it inside and then went to talk to them and we were throwing it around. I left. This guy came after me. I ran into a shop and Nana was there. I called Mom. The guy was at the window. I managed to get to the car and Nana couldn't drive, so I got in the drivers seat and this evil woman was going to the passenger side so I took off. I almost crashed. I went home and there was no wood shed. Dad was there.
