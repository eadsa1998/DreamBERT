A friend and I were standing on a table next to a wall in the garage of our fraternity house. We were taking pieces of carved marble, which might have been parts of a builder's facade, from statues and throwing them to the floor. (I don't remember whether or not they broke.) A cop came along and shined a flashlight in our eyes. We jumped off the table and out of the garage. (The cop was the short, fat one who guards the Severance Hall parking lot.) He had a large, mostly white dog; maybe a collie. The dog chased us. We climbed over a back fence (with difficulty) and escaped.
