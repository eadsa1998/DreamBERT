 I'm with two people at an airport. I stop and give all my clothes to a man, asking him to hold them for a moment. I take my pair of black underwear and try to put them on. I spin them on my finger for a bit, twirling them. I get them on, and go back to the man for my other clothes. The man is about to sell my clothes. I quickly say that I'll give him money, but then I beat him, kicking him in the groin and taking my clothes. From then on, he is younger, and he is after me for revenge. I leave. I am with the group of students that are in my traveling class. We go to a place numbered 50 on a city map. The man I beat up is still pursuing me. Outside the airport is a scruffy young man. He asks me, "Would you care for psychology?" He has a thick accent. At first I don't understand him. Then I realize he wants to talk about psychology, and I say yes. <br/
