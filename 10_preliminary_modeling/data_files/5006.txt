I am seated at a table with lots of food on it. A woman comes up and says, "You are going out with my husband and I am going out with my ex-husband." I feel somewhat embarrassed and want to explain to her that I mean no harm. I'm not trying to take her husband away. I don't say anything. Then I get up and walk over to my "date." It's Pat Brown. He's wearing a sweater that had been cut in a semi-circle and his chest skin was cut too. He remarked it had been dome by a chainsaw and it sure hurt! He repeated a groaning "Ow!" several times! He seemed surprised at his stupidity of letting himself get cut. [BL]
