[Last night's dream not clearly remembered. I believe the hot, sultry nights have some effect on my dream memory. On waking in the morning or during the night, I feel hot, uncomfortable, but seem to be in a half-stupor for some little time -- quite different from the alert and more relaxed and rested feeling in cool weather.] One dream entirely lost except for the incident of the new chair (a large, wooden one) which was obtained for Beth at office. I recall that the chair was being pushed up to the desk.
