I was walking through an area about a mile square. The buildings appeared at first to be all seven stories high. Then I noticed that what appeared to be a sky was the underside of streets built at the seven story level and supported by the buildings. The streets were wall to wall, which gave the appearance of a sky. I went to the upper level. Later, I walked over an overpass, and I passed some caged monkeys.
