It was in my house. In my bedroom. I was asleep and then awoke with the rumbling sound. The house was shaking and things were breaking. It was a tornado. I quickly went under my bed because it was in the basement. The house was taken off the foundation and strewn about. My family was in the house. My two brothers, two sisters, mom and dad all died. My bed broke and fell on top of me. Some people found me and took me to a hospital where I saw my older brother, who doesn't live with me and heard the bad news. We went to the funeral home and then I awoke.
