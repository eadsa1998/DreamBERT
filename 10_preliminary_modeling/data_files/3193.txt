I am feeling strong emotion and want to go to a cafe where I can sit alone and write about it, or feel it. I walk and walk. I see a cafe, but it's closed. I go to the outskirts of town and see some pancake houses. I go into one and as I am standing at the counter. I talk to a woman friend, maybe Ginny. I have decided to buy an eye thing for this mentally retarded girl so she can see out of her bad eye. It's like buying her an eyeball for part of one so she can see. I'm going to put it on my Visa. As I am doing this, Nate suddenly comes up to me from behind. I see him and I see his 12-year-old son. So we talk like strangers or acquaintances. The back of his son's head is bumpy and big and ill formed. So are his ears. My father is the man at the counter doing my Visa. He hands it back and I ask if he put it in the right (correct) pocket. He hasn't and I'm a bit annoyed. Nate's wife comes in and I try to behave normally and nonchalant. I tell him I'm buying this eye thing for this MR girl. I feel a bit self-righteous. I am then putting my things back in my purse and decide to give my paper toy train cutouts to the son. I hand him one his father has already put together for me and then I see a line of paper doll cutouts all holding hands and give them to him and then see a line of little black animals and give him that. Now I am on my way.
