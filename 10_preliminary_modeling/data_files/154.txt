I'm getting dressed in a bedroom (not mine?), standing facing the side of the bed (not mine) with my back to the door. I've got on a rather neat shirt, maybe new, new to me at least, gold-color, not shiny - a sort of basket-weave, with a collar, buttons up to the neck. I look pretty sharp, but I'm supposed to have a black jacket on - my own black jacket - but it's not washed and I can't put it on. It's lying on the bathroom floor [like mine really is] and even if I was willing to wear it dirty, it's crumpled. Besides, it's not really nice any more - it's had most of the color worn or washed off by now and it would detract from the shirt if I did put it on. All the same, I feel rather inadequate without a jacket, underdressed. I'm supposed to be dressed up nice for something that's going on. I'm uncomfortable about it, and hug the shirt around me. I still look pretty classy though.
