I dreamed that Sue and I were going grocery shopping for some reason, and were having a discussion about whether or not people had been looking at us funny when we were in the store. Then we were at a concert on a mountain, and there was lots of construction. Anyway, in order to hear the music better, you had to climb up the mountain. It was easy for Sue, but I kept sliding down because I had a huge backpack on. Then I was at some sort of funeral, and I had to paint a kimono for whomever it was that died. Everyone kept criticizing my work, and ate all the cupcakes I made. Then I started to plan my birthday party.
