There were lots of little kittens outside and I gathered them and put them into this giant cage, which had little cages in it. I then saw two crocodiles on top of the shed and a nasty looking one on top of a door. One of the two on the shed, died. Later, it was alive and I was playing with it. I went in the pool and it jumped in after me. Later, Ezra and a friend were near the pool and were going to go for a swim. Then they saw the crocodile and moved away. I said they were friendly. One of the crocodiles reminded me of Kiefer Sutherland.
