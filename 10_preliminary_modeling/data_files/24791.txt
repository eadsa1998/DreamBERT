I was with this guy I had had a crush on for a long time. We were in school and then he pulled out a gun and grabbed me. Then his friend pulled out a gun and he grabbed my friend Robin L. (She's doing a journal too.) They took us to a house and tried to kiss us. We all of a sudden started doing all these self-defense moves and beat them up. Setting: At school and at that house. Characters: Robin L. is one of my friends in school, and there were also two guys from school so I knew them all. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared. I thought that this dream was very strange. I mean, why would a guy kidnap me from school?
