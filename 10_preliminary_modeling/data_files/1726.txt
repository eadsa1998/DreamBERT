I have a new roommate and am working out stuff. I decide to take off for awhile. I get on an old motorcycle and take off, find an autobahn and choose an exit to the river. I almost do not go but decide it's OK. I look like Suzanne (the Interpreter.) When I return the next morning, my roommates are concerned and worried. "Where were you last night?" I am annoyed they want to know and that someone tells them.
