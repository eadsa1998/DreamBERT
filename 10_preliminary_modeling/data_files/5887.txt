A German officer is walking toward me and for some reason I don't want him to see me, and I crouch down in a large armchair so my head doesn't show. Then he sees me and shouts something. I realize I am wearing pajamas and a blue bathrobe and he must have spotted me quickly. I follow him and my feet, which are bare, hurt from walking on the stones. We enter a building. He disappears and I see a man looking at a picture of clouds. The drawing also shows some of the buildings on New York City's 53rd St. and I walk up to him and tell him that the street is 53rd. He nods and smiles and says nothing, and I realize he probably only speaks German.
