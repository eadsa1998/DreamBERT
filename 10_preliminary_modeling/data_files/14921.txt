I was watching Friday the 13th, but it was different and I was in it, or something. I was at some place near a forest and there was a party. I got away. I went to Cat Haven. This guy was there. The whole place was inside and there were only like 10 cages and they didn't put them down. I said I wanted to say a quick hello. Tigger and Gizmo were there. He asked for my name. The next day I got there early and no-one was there. Also, one of the rules was 'don't refuse anyone'. This lady came and took Tigger (like bought or adopted her). I told Mom and Ezra in the car later and I cried. Then it was just me and Mom. She saw some cops and went down this alley, but it was a walkway. We got to the top of it and this taxi drove past. They signaled the cops. We got out of the car and I took my shoes off and we went down some steps into this apartment like area and it was inside and underground. We walked through and out into a park thing. The cops and another cop car were on the street. This black guy climbed the fence and went into formation to say "Police!". He arrested Mom and gave me her car keys. I went to the top and my shoes were gone. I thought they must've been stolen but I couldn't remember if I had even brought them. I went to a shop and when I left I realized I didn't have my phone on me. I saw a girl kick it away and I went and got it and found my shoes. She had stolen them and we got into a fight. I gave her a deep paper cut and I had a strange pattern on my wrist. Later I went back to the Cat Haven and she came and we had another fight.
