I am walking across a busy city street. A man starts talking. We enjoy talking. He comes home with me. Muffin Cat goes around releasing emotional outbursts. Cousin Willie has negotiated to work more hours so he and his wife can afford a house. At first, I don't think he's put on too much extra, but I figure up the hours and see that he'll work 10 hours more a week. 5 weeks a month. I'm now on a street corner saying goodbye to my friend. We keep saying goodbye and then not leaving. We say, "Oh, we had such a nice time, thanks." He mentions the name of a friend of his in NYC, Rizzo's. He spells his name for me. I write it down incorrectly, Terano. I get the T in the wrong place and then I spell it twice. It's all a last minute notion, to get his name. I think, "Oh. It might be a good idea after all. I might be pregnant and I need to get hold of him." Then I remember that I couldn't be pregnant, we didn't make love. Finally I say, "Goodbye," and turn and walk away. I start to cross a street. A blonde, pretty woman in a fancy silver grey car is part way into the intersection. I think about walking around her and then the light changes to green and she drives on. It's a corner in M City. I decide not to cross the street. I walk down the street. On the left is a store front. It's a cop station. I see 4 or 5 cops (male), standing around. I casually look in as I walk by and I'm stunned to see a picture of my friend as a newspaper headline, "Wallton Returns." There is a picture of him running amuck with his clothes ripped in shreds, down to the street. I feel shock and a little fear. I spent the night with him! But, he was friendly! Maybe he'll come back and be dangerous.
