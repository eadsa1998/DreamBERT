I'm standing under an awning looking at a small house and my dog (I've never had a dog in real life), a German shepherd. The neighbors are yelling because he's barking too much. I call him and he runs over to me and is quiet, but then many other dogs appear in the back yard. They're all playing together. After they finish, I find myself sitting on a stool in a kitchen. The house is full of people, but the party is ending and everyone is going home. Two girls that I don't know get close to me. I guess I'm giving them a ride home. I see Mahorn walking outside alone and I open the window. He  stops, looks in and propositions my girls for a threesome. I say, "It's time to go," and we walk across a dirt field to my car and speed off down a dirt road. Dust is everywhere. I wake up.
