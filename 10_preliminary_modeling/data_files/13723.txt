I was at 'home'. Sometimes it was Mom's house. Kenny Hotz was there and he was trying to kill me I think. I hit Spenny with a metal pole and he fainted. I hit Kenny and he was bleeding, but was ok. I ended up in the pool. I had a shower at Mom's house. I got out and realized I had forgotten to wash the conditioner out. Ezra came to ask me something. I was then at 'school'. Some guy called Tim Course, who was an actor, was coming. Ms Corbett was in the common room, which was different. She asked me to go. Calvin and Liesl were there. We were getting put in groups and Calvin was trying to get me in his group, but I wasn't going to go to see the actor guy.
