I was at some place and I was on a computer. We weren't allowed on Urban-RPG, but I went on anyway and some guy came over so I had to get off. I was with some people and we were watching these people trying to save some dog, and they succeeded. I then went to Mom's house. I was in the kitchen and Colin Farrell was there and laughed at something and he was like, "hee hee hee", like he was teasing me. Then I realized his presence and blocked his face and Mom was like "he's a nice guy, very cute" and I was just like "What the flip? EW!".
