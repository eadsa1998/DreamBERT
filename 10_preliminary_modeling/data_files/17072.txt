My mom called me on the telephone to tell me that my Dad's new job opportunity fell through. She also told me he slipped another disk in his back. My family had just move back to our home area. My high school friends came to visit me and see the new house. It was extremely large, and very nice. They commented on this. One of them requested a tour. I said sure. My friend Ron said he had to go poop. We all light-heartedly jeered him, and I showed him the downstairs bathroom. I teased him about stinking up my new bathroom.
