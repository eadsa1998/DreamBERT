I was a patient working on printing presses in a laundry. I wanted to work in the composing room, but I was not sure of my ability. A young boy was assigned to help me in the composing room. Later I heard that all the patients there would be transferred because we were able to see each other now. She seemed sad about it. My mother came and said she was going to a town upstate and would be back with the good news. I hoped the news was about my transfer to a Veterans Hospital. While I was working in the shop, I was wearing a hospital gown.
