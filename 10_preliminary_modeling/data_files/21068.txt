I looked into the sky and could see trees on the clouds. Then I could see the green leaves on them. I told Bob Lippert to look and it turned out to be on the ground, beautiful green forest. A bull came out and I started to climb a tree. I got a job in graphite bronze and I went to the men's room. There were about 4 toilets and they were all full of shit.
