I was with Bill F, Brian F, Bob F, Daddy, and Matthew. Matthew was only 9 or 10 years old. We went someplace to eat, like a Hardee's. Right inside the door were platters of food on each side of the door. We were to choose what we wanted from these trays. It seemed that they were sitting on top of the trashcans that you typically find in this type of restaurant. We each got a plate and started choosing what we wanted. Matthew and one of the others would take a fork and take something off the platter and put it straight in their mouth. I told them to quit doing that because it was very bad manners. I told them that they need to put it on their plates and then eat it when we get to the table. We went to find a table. We found two tables that we could push together so we could eat. We had stopped so Matthew could use the bathroom, but now he had to go again. He and I both decided to leave and go find a bathroom. Daddy was upset that we were going to be gone so long because it was going to take us 2 hours. I told one of the others that this was perfectly reasonable, that we couldn't do it in less time. We went ahead and left. Now we were helping Matthew move into his dorm. It didn't look like his waking life dorm. That didn't take very long at all.
