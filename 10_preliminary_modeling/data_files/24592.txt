I was sitting at a desk slapping my books and a bell run and I walked outside into a woods and I saw all these dogs that looked like my dog. Then I think I got scared and woke up. Setting: In a classroom then in the woods. Characters: my dog, a skinny Dachsund with way too big teeth - like fangs. Kids in the class, always laughing. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, other. In the classroom I was bored. That's one of the weirdest dreams I've ever had!
