Curtis Salgoto tells me about a childhood experience. His alcoholic father would go pass out in different places and once he had to go to a neighbor's house, a girl, and retrieve his father from her bathroom. He said her bathroom was bigger than anything in E City! I laugh and enjoy that image. He then tells me how as children they were each tied to the opposite leg of a big person and she wrestled him and she won and she couldn't understand how he could stand the humiliation of still being tied together. He shrugged and said something like, "You do what you have to do," and then he unpeels himself out of a stick of mud and goes away. Now I'm mixing water and choosing a color pattern to mix (knit) for a sock. I see argyle patterns and different colors like in a color palette, but on this notebook paper - muted greens, etc. I choose one and drop it in the ocean to be mixed. I read the instructions on sizes of knitting needles, #5's. Then I work the mud like in pottery. Now my hands are caked with it and I want to go inside for awhile. I walk to the front door and call to my mother who panics and darts (lunges) toward me as though she thinks I'm hurt. I laugh and say, "I'm OK. It's just me. I did not want to get your house dirty and I want to put it back on when I come back out." She can't understand why I do this.
