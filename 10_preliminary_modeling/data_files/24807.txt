I can't remember it very well. A woman came to the school and talked to us about the effects of poverty on daily life. I remember her showing us how people brush their teeth without toothpaste. Setting: I think it took place in the communications center and classroom 1 of My school Middle School. Characters: My classmates (the 7th graders) were all in my dream, and a woman I don't know. She was about 40-something and had brown hair. Feelings and Thoughts: Sad, worried. Yesterday, we watched a documentary on homeless kids. My mom has been looking for work for five years and we've been low on money ($30 in the bank) for a while.
