I was driving a group of people somewhere.  When we came to a stop at our destination (which I believe was in the woods), I noticed that the front tire on my side was canted at a rakish angle and about to fall off.  I thought it was miraculous that we had made it safely, since we had been driving at high speed much of the time.  We put the car up on some kind of rack, and I was horrified at the shape it was in.  It was twisted and dented and corroded, and was covered with acid which was still wet, and which had been put on it, it seems, by the Viet Cong.
