At first I was in my own living room. The whole family was sitting around. My aunt who is about forty said something to me and the next thing I knew I was standing in front of a large brick and stucco house that looked Austrian in appearance. A little boy was knocking on the door, suddenly he turned and threw a snowball at another little boy standing next to me, the snowball hitting him on the head. The next thing I knew I was on the second floor of this house. Seated around the room were some Austrians in their native costumes, drinking beer. On one side of the room were three or four very close friends of mine. Some very competent people were setting up apparatus for a radio program. I noticed a plump, blond girl specially. After this I found myself setting up laboratory equipment.
