The Mystic River Chorale, which is my community chorus, was rehearsing in a classroom where we usually hold rehearsals on Monday nights and for some reason we began to sing Vivaldi's (Biachishpere?) and as we were singing it I looked through my folder of Braille music sheets and said "wait a minute! Its not in there, why are we singing this again, we just sang it last Christmas , this isn't appropriate for spring" and yet on second thought, I said, "Well, we'll be able to hear Tracy and Jenny sing again during the solos so that'll be good".
