I found a pony eating gladiolas in our front yard. I was going to chase him away, but when he looked at me I became very much afraid. He laid his ears back and bared his teeth. His eyes were a bright, glittering green. I tried to run back into the house, but my legs were heavy and numb. I had to hold the side of the house and pull myself along. Even after I woke up I could see those green eyes.
