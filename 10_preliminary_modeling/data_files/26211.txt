 I go into a dorm-like room where there is an answering machine. I think the room is mine. There is a blurred message from my high school classmate Aaron Stevens. My housemate's girlfriend Sunny Pile is there. She is sitting on a bed in white underwear and a shirt. I think this is very open of her. I put some of my socks in a drawer. They are ankle-high socks with red stripes.
