A professor at the university had forced me to give a talk about spring, but I had refused, which caused a fight between the two of us. Since I realized I was to blame, I went before him to apologize. He said to me, "At last you are behaving like a mature person, but I am not going to raise your grade of 25. However, due to the speech, I'll add some more points to your grade depending on how it turns out, and the sum that results from that will be the grade which will go on your report card." After he said that, I started to study a lot, and I fainted at the time of the speech, and my classmates gave me artificial respiration and at last I came to, and asked for my girlfriend to come. I awoke.
