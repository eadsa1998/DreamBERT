This guy ran across a road to the other side which was all forest-y. This girl was there and anyway he started bouncing through the forests but like that game where you throw balls [I don't know what the hell I'm talking about here, and I have a diagram but I don't understand it]. The girl chased after him and when they stopped she jumped into his arms and it turned out they were cousins. He also did some bouncy stuff in a shop. I was in a cinema type thing and there was a movie of me and my friends of short clips of things we had done, but there were extra things on it each time we watched it.
