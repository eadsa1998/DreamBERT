I was flying. Ann, Bob and I were climbing up a steep street. There was a railroad on it. One big freight car broke loose and was coming down the steep grade ahead of the freight. It stopped by itself on the steep grade. We went up part of the way, then we decided it was not worth it because if we slipped, we could fall all the way to the bottom. I hung on by one finger that I put into a hole. Ann was sitting in the dirt and her legs were dirty. She was filthy. I took a pear off a tree. Vance and Denny were there. Then I pulled the branch near and there was a big pear about a foot in diameter and about 20" long. It was soft. So Vance stuck a knife into it and water came out of it. I was standing beside a streetcar. I ran a book or paper along the windows on the men's necks. None moved. They were asleep. A man standing watching me said, "Watch that, big redheaded guy." Then he moved and walked away. He was standing outside the car and his head was as high as the men in the car. He was a big man. I worked my two hands in a fast down movement and it felt as a blown up tire. It felt as though my hands touched solid air and I was gradually hoisting myself up into the air. I got about six feet up as Bob was coming by and I yelled to him and came down. I was driving a small car or contraption of some kind thru water and mud.
