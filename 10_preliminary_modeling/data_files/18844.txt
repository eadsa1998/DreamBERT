The setting was a college campus supposedly. I was walking with this girl whom I apparently felt was an easy lay. We were walking in the hall of what seemed to be the back of a building like indoor alleys (?). She wasn't as easy as I had hoped. I had the feeling I knew her, but I can't recognize her. We got down to the end of the hall and it made a sharp left to a dead-end with a door at the end. It was a counselor's office or some such authority. For some reason we turned around and started to run. We got outside and I told her to run on over to her dorm. I looked behind me, and this girl in her middle 20's was standing behind me. I stopped. She didn't have any legs. She wasn't particularly attractive. She started talking to me, asking me why I ran, etc. The rest of the conversation wasn't recalled, nor the dream.
