Tom (Susan's husband) and Mabel tell me they got married today and I cry. I'm hurt because they didn't tell me before so I could come to the wedding. They said if they told me and then some others, then soon too many people would come or feelings would get hurt. I say, "I should have realized when you told me you got your marriage license yesterday."
