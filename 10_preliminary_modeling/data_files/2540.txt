The landscape is flat, barren, and wet like rows and rows of planted things that haven't started growing above ground yet. Creepy crawly things that are poisonous live all over these rows. There's only one small island free of all this yucky stuff. A woman says, "My ugly daughter is at the island. Some man lured her there to make love." I'm amazed this woman is so open about her ugly daughter. I'm a little offended she would consider her daughter ugly and say so. I go out at night walking on the rows where the creepy things are. I am bare foot and concerned they'll get me. I envision rubber boots on my feet to protect me. I feel better now. I see one of the things that looked like a clam shell with antennas that was eating other things. I feel sad and repulsed when it eats a baby thing. I see it crunching something and see the remains, a tiny pearl necklace and some lace (like it had been a baby). Earlier, I had a cat in my arms and I see two huge insects and I put the cat down and he eats them, crunching loudly as they twitch. (Ugh...) (Somewhere in there Sonja and Nate come in and I say, "Were you at T City, too?" They say, "No.") 1729, 1730, 1731 do not exist.
