My floors are bare of carpets. They are wooden and cold to walk on barefooted. There is a delivery of logs and I move far away so I don't get crushed by them. When I come back to see what I got, I am ashamed to see they are only a pile of stacked shingles for a roof. Someone says there is no shame in this, but I feel embarrassed.
