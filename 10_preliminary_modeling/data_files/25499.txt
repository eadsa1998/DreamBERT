 I'm in a field of grain. It is tall, and hasn't been cut. There are some fences around the field. I'm with another man, who may be my brother Wally. We duck down as people come near. I am in a band that is playing in Big Dance Club. We get paid to play. My classmate Brad Chloe is there. He demands to see a list that he thinks is in my wallet. It is not in my wallet, I show him. There are lots of other bands there, including Smashing Pumpkins.
