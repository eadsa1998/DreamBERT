We are in our bedroom standing at the foot of our bed. Mary comes over to me and begins kissing me on the lips. I respond, and hold her tightly, as I "French" kiss her again and again. As I do so, I bend her over in a passionate embrace. Mary suggests we'd be more comfortable in bed and I agree. We disengage to undress, when Mary suddenly says, "I can't! I'm wet!" or words to that effect. I am disappointed that we will not continue lovemaking but respect her decision to stop.
