Driving in a CAR with Pedro and his friend; he has put some plywood over the windshield so it is like "driving blind." I drive anyhow, very slowly. I have a near accident, but come out OK. Later at home, hear WALLY in the kitchen; "Is there any coffee?" "Yes, of course," I hug him and notice he has a big white bandage over his head and neck I am afraid he was badly injured....
