I thought Matthew had come home late at night. While I heard him at the door I was trying to remember if I chained the door and set the alarm before I went to bed. I was pretty sure that I did so I didn't think he would be able to get in. I heard someone come in the front door and come up the steps. I thought it was Matthew because I thought I heard him calling me as he came up the steps so he wouldn't startle me by popping his head in my bedroom door. I thought I had my eyes open and was watching my bedroom door to show up but he never did. I lay there for a little while and still didn't see him show up at the doorway. I fumbled for the flashlight in my bedside table. This was one of those dreams that I was very sure that I was awake. I turned on my flashlight and pointed it toward my doorway and still didn't see anyone. I decided to go into his bedroom. I shone the flashlight around his bedroom and didn't see anything. I went over to his bed and started to feel around his bed. Even with the flashlight on I couldn't see very well. I remember thinking, oh, good, there isn't anyone in the apartment. Then suddenly I felt these fingers. It startled me so bad I jumped. That woke me up.
