Now I come out of my house. I see a girl (Mexican) named Maria who is burrowing herself into the sand. She lives in a foster home nearby. I go to her. I can only see her face as the rest of her is buried in the sand. I try to speak in Spanish, but switch to English because she's losing interest and will disappear if I don't make myself clear. I invite her to visit my house, explaining that she can watch soap operas on TV (we could hear them from the house). She agrees reluctantly and follows me into the house. I am wearing a wedding ring, two of them. One is a store demo that has two words written on it. Bonnie is in the house.
