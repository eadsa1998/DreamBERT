 I'm with a group of people in a large van-like vehicle. We're going to somewhere in Iowa, and there is confusion about directions. My friends Emily Zates, Esther Thurman, and Tina Totts are there. They tell me I messed Valentines Day, which was March 17th. I laugh and say, "Oh, well." A lot of people decide to do some sit-ups. I do crunches. My junior high classmates Erin Jacobs and Kari Johnson are there. They talk about how they don't really talk to each other anymore. My friend Tom Napper's pull-up bar is there.
