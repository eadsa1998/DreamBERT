We were creating, decorating, bedrooms or something for two girls - I think they were twins. It almost seems that it might have been the actors Mary Kate and Ashley Olson. I don't think so, but at one point it seemed that we were doing a photo shoot. That's why I wonder if it was them. At first the girls were very awkward and didn't' know what to do but then we did something and they quickly got into it and it started going much better. They had a telescope and we were talking about not needing the top of the line telescope with all of the bells and whistles to be able to see some cool things. Somebody we were talking to didn't agree with us so someone was trying to set up one of the telescopes so they could see what we meant. Each of the girls had their own telescopes. Each one was a little different; they weren't the exact same one. During the photo shoot they changed clothes several times though I don't remember them actually doing that. In the dream it looked more like it would if you were watching it on TV where they are suddenly just in a different outfit. I know one of their outfit's was black and another was black with sequins or something like that on it. One was all red.
