Ezra and I were at home watching a zombie movie. Some girl in it thought she looked like some snowman thing. We heard a loud thumping noise and we were hiding under the recliners. I went outside and there were people on the roof. I saw a glimpse of some big red thing. They motioned for me not to say anything to Ezra. Eventually they beat the red thing. Dad got home. The door wouldn't lock with a key anymore. Then it had been a game and I had defeated the red thing and I was now level 2.
