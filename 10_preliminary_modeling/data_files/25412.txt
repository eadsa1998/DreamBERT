 I'm on the Carter School playground in Oak Valley. It is snowing. My mom is in jail. A man talks about how great my mom is. I can't see him. I hear a voice, like that of a radio announcer. There is a huge fallen tree, with its branches cut off, covered in packed down snow. I am climbing the tree, shimmying up its trunk, which is elevated at one end. I am then at the intersection of 2nd Street and Next Avenue. I see my high school classmate Janelle West and another woman. I walk north down Next Avenue towards Touse's house. The two women call out to me, and ask me if that tree is a Redwood. I reply that I don't know. There are a few huge trunks of fallen trees lying close together. I walk on them, going down the hill. I think the tree is a Redwood: its base is huge and spread out. I get to the bottom of the hill. Touse's don't live there anymore. There is the frame of a house, but no actual house. There is a lake with big rocks there. It is a very "Montana" feeling. <br/
