I only recall this dream vaguely: We got two girls in the car of a friend (a friend only in the dream; in real life I don't know him) and then we went to a party at an unknown place, but we did not like the behavior of the girls (whom we did not know) and we went alone out of the party. The girls were very haughty and they seemed to be in complicity. At that moment I woke up.
