["Attracted to what I disapprove of."] A woman is attracted to a fast and loose man. I give her the advice that it will do her no good to date him, and she will end up hurt. She of course ignores me and dates him. Meanwhile, I get into a very fancy red sports car to drive to a party. I like the way the car looks and I like to drive fast. I am driving through some junky bad streets. I carefully drive, fast, and miss the curbs and debris in the road. I am pleased with my driving skill. I get to the bar and go in. I am looking around. A good looking man asks me to dance. I dance with him, aware that he's probably just as bad as the man I advised against. I see him and the woman also dancing there. The man I am with dips me in the dance and I am now leaning into the other couple. I am now attracted to the other man and we flirt.
