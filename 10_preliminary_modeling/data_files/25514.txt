 I'm at Brimson with four or five people. We are riding bicycles. My friend Nate Nelling is there. We are biking north on the path by Old Main, and then past Social Science Hall. There are people coming towards us, on bike or on foot. As we pass, one of them says something about us taking up the middle of the path. I shrug off the comment, thinking, "Fuck off". My dad is there. A bearded man I don't know points him out to me and says that he was at the Tea Hall dormitory looking for me. I go back to the dormitory. I store the bicycle I am on. I have a door key but I drop it, and am without. I am on my way upstairs to see my dad. The hall advisor says she won't require 12 meals to be eaten with her, only 10 meals. The stairs are square, and rising. I pick up pennies. A woman comes over and blatantly asks me out. It is my old classmate Jerome Michaels' girlfriend. I say to her, "What about Jerome?" Another woman comes over and the two women fight. I sneak away up the stairs. My friends Esther Thurman and Jana Green are arguing over who is going to shower with me: they both want to. There are people watching. I say that neither is going to shower with me. I enter the shower alone with my towel and close the door. The shower stall is short, and I easily see over the top. The spray of water hits me on my lower torso and below.
