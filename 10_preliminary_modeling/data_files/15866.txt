I went somewhere for a party thing or something. It wasn't anything big or fancy. I was there early and saw someone wearing a shirt that said 'Stephen Merchant' on it and then I realised it was Stephen Merchant. I walked up excitedly and was like 'omg I don't want to sound weird but I'm a big fan' and he was happy to chat with me. He got a bit drunk and started coming on to me a bit strong and I pushed him away and left. Then I wondered why I was pushing him away since I'd wanted that for so long, but I didn't want a random drunken fumble. When I went back later, he was gentler and whispered an apology in my ear.
