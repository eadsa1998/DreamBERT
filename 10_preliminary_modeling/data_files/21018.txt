I had a fire in a tunnel I made and the fire got red hot. I looked into it. I got down into a hole with Ann and pulled out a large weed and threw it into the fire. I went into a bookie joint and met Mike. He gave me a scratch sheet. I looked at Hazel Park. Bobby was with me. He went over to play with two small dogs and one growled at him and I told him to get away from them.
