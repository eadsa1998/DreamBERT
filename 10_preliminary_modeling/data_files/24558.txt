It was an open house at some school (some really rich school) and my parents went with some snooty lady and I went with some of my Middle El friends and the nasty P.E. teacher. We went to the racing track and sat down in the bleachers. The teacher told us about the activities there, and then showed us horseback riding. Some really fancy-schmancy teenagers in red and black uniforms on nice horses rode in front of us. The two boys on really fast ponies ran past us. I hated one boy and after the race was over, I said to him, "I can run faster than your pony." "Oh, yeah?" he said. "Yeah." "Let's race." Then I woke up. Setting: Some school I don't know, and a race track. Characters: Betty (Middle El friend), Al (another), and the nasty P.E. teacher (snotty like all the rest) me, a nasty kid with his friend, and two ponies. Feelings and Thoughts: Angry. I was angry because I didn't get to race against that snotty, nasty kid.
