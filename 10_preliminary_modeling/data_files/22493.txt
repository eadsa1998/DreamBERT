Lat night I dreamed that my sister was marrying an ex-boyfriend of mine. I was asking myself how she could marry him, given that he was such a nasty boy, and I thought that at home they like him very  much. I remember that the groom arrived late and was dressed in brown, but I didn't go to the wedding. I simply couldn't agree with this, and besides, I saw him as being too young for my sister (though they are both of the same age in reality). I know I dreamed a lot more things, but at this point my mind has gone blank. That's all.
