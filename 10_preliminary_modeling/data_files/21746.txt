I was swimming in a stream that was in the street and there were small dogs in it coming at me. I splashed water on them. The dogs were so small, I picked one up in my hand. Down the stream further a larger dog came after me and wanted me to play with him. He spoke to me to do so, so I played with him as though he was biting me and I was getting away from him. I sent a letter to a company complaining I got a wrong fit on a piece of wood when I mailed it. It dawned on me I had the wood backwards when I tried to fit the two pieces. So I received an answer and they said I was holding the wood backwards.
