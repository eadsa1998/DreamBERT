A few nights ago I had a dream that my sound system upstairs belonged to the school system, and that sometimes I would see some maintenance guy in a suit and tie come over and put the receiver and the CD writer on a cart and wheel it into my closet. And he said that that was going to be storing it until next year. And as soon as he left, I would take it out and put it back on the desk. And I had to return a book to Mrs. Talmadge, but I was too afraid to go up to her, and I don't think I ever returned it before I woke up. Last night I had a very peculiar dream. First of all I dreamt that we were near a sea wall at the waterfront, and everybody wanted me to scuba dive. They said that if I wanted to stay down there for three weeks, I was going to need scuba gear [laugh]. And also I dreamt that Tweety was this paper Styrofoam bird with paper wings and a napkin folded and all for her tail. And she was really a listening device so that I could monitor what people were saying on the phone. And there was also these two other birds, Archie, my cockatiel and then there was this white bird -- very delicate with a plume -- and wings that were raised up. And then both of those birds were kind of in cahoots with the Styrofoam Tweety somehow, and the wings of the other white bird also stayed up for some reason. Then I also dreamt that I was sitting on the steps with my feet towards the up of the steps, and I was trying to get the mini-cassette to work, and the terminals were like way loose, and it wasn't really cooperating. There was this big cardboard box ____??_______. And then Dad comes up the steps. Anyway, this tape is really squeaky now. And then Dad comes up the stairs and says that it's my problem. And then I woke up.
