I had a dream I went to the grocery store and there were all these cute guys around me and as I was walking to the store they were all looking at me and the finest guy ever came up to me and gave me his name, number, and address and his name was Bin--, because I didn't understand what he was trying to tell me and his name, he was mumbling. It felt so weird and funny at the same time. But I liked that feeling. The setting was blurry and the ground was shaking but I was used to it and it was all normal. And when I got inside molesters were coming up to me.
