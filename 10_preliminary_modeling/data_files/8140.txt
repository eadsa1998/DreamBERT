I had gone to Kroger late one evening to pick up a couple of things. The parking spaces were parallel to the front of the store. The end of the row was even with the left frame of the door. There was a space open close to the end of that row. I pulled up and zipped into that space. As I did this I saw other people very upset, some milling around and some leaving. I noticed that the store was completely dark and closed. Then I saw a sign on the door that said the store was closed due to someone accidentally shooting someone as a result of trying to help them. I think there was at least one person lying on the ground. There were police officers there and they had taped off an area with the yellow tape that we see at a crime site. I think they have covered up one body. I think there were emergency vehicles there as well. I went ahead and got in my car. To leave I had to drive into the taped off area and then back out again. I either had to drive under or through the tape.
