I appeared with a friend of mine in a downtown department store. It was night and the store was closed. There was a faint light, enough to see by. My friend stood by without emotion with apparent loyalty while I selected different clothes that I wanted, especially sweaters. After a short time my mother appeared. She too stood by while I handed her different articles I had picked out. While I was still looking over clothes it became dawn and almost immediately time for the store to open. The three of us were hiding behind counters as the store clerks came in. This is where the dream trailed into nothing.
