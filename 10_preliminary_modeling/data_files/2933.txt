I must check out dream number 286. Now I'm at Grandma Mildred's house, only it's different. Dovre and I are going to go on a trip. Dovre is going to drive. She helps me with food and things. We look at a map and Dovre says, "We can go all the way to the tip of South America." It sounds interesting to me. Dovre drives the car through the house and the front yard. I see lots of cats and I'm worried we will accidentally run over them. I feel a bump and feel queasy, thinking we did run over one. I see a brown cat and remark about how big it is. I look again and see its face. It's a pig, only it has a body of a cat! No wonder it's so big; it's really a pig. Then I look at advertisements in a newspaper or magazine and see the name Curtis Salgoto. He's advertising his music tape. The ad is like a movie on small dark negative like film or a negative. I am impressed and watch. It's his story. He's a small boy, maybe 9 years old. He's part black. He plays his harp. I tell Dovre he's my favorite harp man. He's good. He says he's going to move to K falls (Klamath) and I laugh. It's hard enough making it to the big time, but to move to Klamath will make it much harder. I didn't know he was black. Now he's lying face down in a river and his father pulls him out and says, "What are you doing?" He smiles and says he's OK. Bonnie sits in the river next to him to see if he's OK and not drowning.
