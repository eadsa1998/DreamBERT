I am coming from someone's house on the bus in my hometown at night.  I get off downtown.  I go to the post office, where I see Jackie Levis first, and then Pat Byers.  Pat is wearing a red dress.  I realize that we have broken up, and I calmly tell her hello.  She is very friendly and smiling.   Still in the post office, I think we are near a hydrogen bomb blast, or even several.  Every time there would be a terrific bright flash at the window, I close my eyes.  The noise or shock is not so great, but there is a red area like part of the famous fireball and also a mushroom cloud.
