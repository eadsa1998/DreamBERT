I look out my living room window at early dawn while it is still somewhat dark both indoors and out and see a man with an animal head facing me head on. I stare at him eye to eye for a few minutes to figure out who he is and what he wants, not sure all the while whether he is able to see me back through the dimly lit glass. The sun comes up and now it is daylight. "He is a masked burglar staking out my house", I think. I run to the door, open it and rush out. The potential burglar sees me coming and runs away across my front lawn and down the street. As he flees I notice that his animal head is an elaborate mask of a wild boar with a lot of hair and a snout nose. There are some children playing on the street, and I warn them, "He is a burglar. Beware of him."
