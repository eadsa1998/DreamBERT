Both the house and the car had just gotten an alarm because somebody was paranoid about burglars breaking in. Well, after that I was paranoid about the thing going off. First of all, in the car we were kind of afraid to turn on the radio, we were afraid to move or anything, and because, you know how that goes, and there was a little click when it turns on and another little click when it turned off, and we weren't really sure exactly which was which. And in the house I was afraid for people to come to the door and ring the doorbell, and so on and so forth. And I dreamt that I was going to stay up late and bake cookies for Zane and Chelsea, and then they come over, which is even better, and then they come in and fortunately the alarm doesn't go off. And we roll out the dough and I start cutting out cookies, and then I fade into consciousness.
