I was at home and I had been studying. I got distracted and Ezra and I found extras that came with a movie. We had to plug a cord into a slot of something. I was about to go to bed and I heard someone like "[something] thing is in the respiratory system" and trying to break in. I went to my room and they did break in. I called out to Darren "someone's in the respiratory system" and he was like 'go away'. They said like "shit!". Darren refused to believe me and Mom encouraged him to believe me. Then he got up but the guys were long gone. I said I would never joke about that, ever. There was a movie with Kevin Kline and he and a bunch of others were like spies or something. Their names depended on where they did stuff, eg, Ms Solomon and some guy ended with "aizal". Some others called Beason and Eastland. Kevin liked this girl called Izzy. I was annoyed at how Americans say my name. His black friend said he should ask her out. It was The Big Chill like. Then James Van Der Beek and a friend were at a table. He liked the guy (he was gay), but he was young and I said "what is he, 12?". Then it was a movie and there were zombies. We were in a room and at first there was only one zombie but then there were heaps. I called the guy down and I was in like a storage section of a food shop and said to bring weapons like brooms, but he got killed. The movie was in stages and the next bit showed a zombie waking up and this young guy was going around the shop. James and a friend watched. This girl was having a smoke on a bench that his friend liked.
