I was at work and it was different and there were lots of people working there. Isaak was getting me to fill out a form for a uniform. I heard someone crying in pain and I walked out this door to a hall outside, which led to the inside of a mall near a McDonald's and there was a girl on the floor holding ice on her leg.
