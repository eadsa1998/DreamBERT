My husband was sitting in a chair and I had just lain down on the couch. I was wearing my robe. The apartment door was open and we soon heard voices in the hall which we recognized as our parents'. They brought us food, and my mother went into the basement and put meat in our refrigerator. She went up the stairs ahead of me, turned out the cellar light, and locked the door as I was coming up. She opened the door for me as soon as she realized that I wasn't up yet. Since I had no makeup on when our parents arrived, I then went into the dressing room to put some on.
