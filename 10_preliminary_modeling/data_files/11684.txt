I dreamt that I went swimming in a deep pool that was not familiar to me. I took all my clothes off and put them on the bank. I began swimming. When I finished I got out of the pool. I began looking for my clothes but I couldn't find them. Suddenly I saw a girl holding the clothes and beckoning me to come with her. She began running and I ran after her. She put my clothes in a cave and disappeared.
