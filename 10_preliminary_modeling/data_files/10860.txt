I went into the reserve bookstore to buy some green-lined three-ring notebook paper. There were quite a few people in the store. I do not remember seeing any faces clearly. I saw a stack of the paper I wanted , but the pile was uneven and each package had about five sheets in it and were all dirty and messed up. I think someone looked at me quizzically while I looked through them to find a neat, clean package. So I turned around and found a nice neat stack of the paper I had come to buy and picked up a package.
