My brother, David Hardy, Miss Carpenter, Gladys and I are in a house. I am trying to get dressed, but so far have only succeeded in putting on a pair of long legged underclothes which are ragged and patched. The right leg has a large hole in it. I would like to go to the bathroom to complete my dressing but fear that someone will need to come in before I can finish.
