I was with my friend, Katie, and we were in the mall shopping for clothes.  We went to my house, and then went to the school dance in our new clothes.  I danced with Bryce, who lifted me up in the air like I was flying.  Then I danced with Aaron.  After the dance, me and my friend Mattie went to see "Thoroughly Modern Millie" on Broadway.  We went to buy programs, and the whole place was lit up with a red light.  We started to go back to our seats, but I went up the wrong set of stairs.  At the top of the stairs, it was pitch black dark, so I ran back down and went back to our seats.  The show started and a thin lady with blonde hair came down in a trapeze.  She was only wearing a thong and a bra.  She started singing, and then I was there with her.
