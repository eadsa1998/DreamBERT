I dreamt that I was in the university at night. My fiancé had told me that he would stop by there so that I would introduce him to my classmate Smith (this is a rather odd boy at the university; he is very sensitive and has many illusions). When he arrived at the university, I, another boy, and Smith were talking. The other boy talked about the automation of man and all the dehumanizing of man that is taking place as a result of progress. When my fiancé arrived, he found Smith crying, making strange sounds. We were all laughing because we thought that he was laughing. That's all.
