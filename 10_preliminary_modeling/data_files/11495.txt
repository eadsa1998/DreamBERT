I was driving my car along a dark road. All of a sudden a figure lurched out in front of me. I was unable to swerve from it and I struck it head on. I was awfully afraid and I stepped on the gas to get out of there. I kept going faster and faster. Then behind me two headlights kept getting closer so I went even faster. I was going about 85 when I started to skid but I got control of the car again and thought everything was alright when an edge of a cliff was right before me. Then my car's steering went wrong and I plunged off the cliff. My dream ended here.
