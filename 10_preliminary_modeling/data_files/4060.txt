["Hollywood"]  Burt Lancaster and I are sitting close together. He asks me when I went to Hollywood. I laugh and say I was there. He says did you get auditions? What happened? He is expecting to hear that I was a success as an actress. I laugh and say I had to leave. The vacation was over and my parents had to go home. It was a great joke.
