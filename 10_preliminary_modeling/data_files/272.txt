I've gone to a party at Lorren's house. Lori and Renee are there, but for the most part I don't know anybody. There's particularly a group of nice-looking young men, who are having a pretty good time but sticking together. Little by little people are going away, and I figure they must be leaving. Eventually I have no clothes on [though I don't know why I took them off, except I know I think it's the thing to do], and I wonder if somehow people don't want to be around me because of it. I decide I might as well leave - I know Lori and Renee are in another room watching TV, and I suppose I ought to say goodbye to somebody, so I go that way and find there's a lot more people in there than I thought. Maybe half the party's in there, just watching TV. I'm really at a loss now. I put my clothes back on and leave.
