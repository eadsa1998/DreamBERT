I was driving a station wagon through some streets which were very familiar to me because I used to live around there. In the street there is a boy of about 18 years who has several fox skins, and he shows them to me. As I know him, I invite him to drive around with me, but he tells me that first he has to return the hides to his father, and he puts them in a bag. While driving alone in the station wagon, I come upon a sand pile on the road, which I am barely able to go through. A car coming behind me is not able to go through it and I make fun of the people in that car. There is a lady and a girl of about 18 years. I start to discuss with them about the sand. They tell me that they are not to blame because they are building a house, and I tell them that this is not a good reason for them to put sand on the road. When I turn around, I find that the station wagon is dismantled and submerged in the pile of sand. I start to pull the parts of the station wagon out of the sand with great ease, even though the parts are very big. The body of the car is ruined. I tried to fix it.
