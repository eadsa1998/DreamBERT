Bob B. came to my mind. Grandpas went to Europe to visit and there was a threat of war and he was stranded there. I went into a store and saw a lot of Immies and candy. I got an album made and when Bob got it from the mail man, he tore the cover off it and I didn't like it, so I went back to the store and asked what they would charge to put on a new cover, and the girl said 95 cents. I was watching a movie and radio performance. A gang of colored men and a woman came over and Uncle Joe told them how a gang of colored guys announce a colored ball game and get $2000 for it. He paid a nigger and a dog started to bark at him.
