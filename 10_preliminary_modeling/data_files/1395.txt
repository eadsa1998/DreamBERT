Howard is sitting on the passenger side in the front. Dovre and I are in the back of a station wagon. He puts the camera on the dashboard. I say, "Don't put the camera in the sun. It will hurt the film." He is annoyed at me and I smile, because it's what he used to say to me. I take the camera and hand it to Dovre to put in its case. She doesn't do it right and I complain to her. I feel a little strange that I'm with Howard again, but it's almost pleasant. We're over the worst and have mellowed out.
