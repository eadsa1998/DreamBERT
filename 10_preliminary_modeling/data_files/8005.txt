I was very excited to see Uncle A. I was at St. Joseph church. The church had hardwood flooring. The majority of the floor was raised about three steps. When you entered the main part of the church you had to go up 2-3 steps to get to the pews. For some events they would move the pews back, or around, to make the floor more like a stage. They had moved all the pews to the back of the church and the lowest level. Father came back near the pews but remained on the top level. When I came in I saw Uncle A and Aunt J sitting in one of the pews. I was so excited to see him. I immediately went and sat next to him and told him how long I had been waiting for this and I had so much to say and so many things I wanted to ask him. I apologized over and over for not being at his funeral and told him how badly I have always felt about that.
