["Research going wrong."] I am in some African country doing research. I have very bad eyesight. I wear thick glasses and have trouble seeing well even with them. A group of guys come by, one young, good looking and insensitive is making fun of me. I ignore him and am walking to the post office to send a letter. I walk through several rooms and find the post office. I walk up to the counter and can vaguely see a woman. I hand her the letter I am sending and turn to walk away. Then I realize that I was actually seeing the reflection of myself in a mirror and had laid the letter down on the counter. It will never get sent. I pick it back up. The guy is following me, teasing. He's supposed to be doing research on me (my dreams I think) and he's not doing it. I go to another room where the professor (like Milton Kramer) is seated. I say to him, I understand that the original research information of mine isn't as valid anymore. But this guy is missing out on current research he could be doing on me and the others. He has forgotten your theories.
