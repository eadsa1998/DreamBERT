I was in the house I grew up in. Andy (my brother) and Ringo (my cat) were sleeping soundly in the living room under many blankets. They were next to a mirror. Rosy (my landlady) came in to fumigate with her dog. Under the blankets there was also a baby chick or duckling gasping for air. It was black and very tiny -- about one inch long. It was dying. Rosy squashed it. Suddenly I'm out on the street (same area where I grew up) and there's a crossing guard in her car. The crossing guard is Libby Rudin and she has a dog. She's talking to me but her windows are up and I can't hear what she's saying. Then I'm on a freeway which is empty but some guy has stopped his car in the middle. I'm looking down on it from a higher place. The police come and there's a car chase.
