I was part of a group of vampires. This one guy that was a vampire was afraid of the head vampire and wanted to leave. He didn't want to be a vampire any more. I helped him escape. I led him to these train tracks. He turned into a bat, then into a boy's car, and got away. Then I was with Eliza. She kissed me, but it was a violent kiss that didn't feel good at all. I was sad because I wanted very much to kiss her, but not like that. I imagined what it would be like to make luxurious, sweet, passionate love with her. I asked her if she wanted to make love. She said, "I like you," but I couldn't tell what she meant by the tone of her voice. She wanted to tie me up. I wanted to, but I was afraid she would hurt me. I said, "OK, but do you promise not to hurt me?" She said, "Fine, if you don't trust me..." Then she left. The head vampire guy came over to me. He wanted to whip me for helping the other vampire guy escape. I told him that I wasn't into being whipped and that I needed to go look for Eliza. He let me go.
