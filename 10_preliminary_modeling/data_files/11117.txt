My mother has had trouble with her bridge in her mouth and I dreamed that I broke my front tooth (bottom tooth) and that I was supposed to be going away that night to a formal and my mother had this bridge laying on her dresser and when she went downstairs, I quickly picked up her teeth (there are four in all) and tried to fit them into my mouth, but my mother came upstairs and caught me and then I woke up.
