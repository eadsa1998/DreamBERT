["Trouble with Paulina and Lance's marriage."] Paulina is very upset with Lance. He is sleeping in a bed. The babies had slipped down between the wall and the bed. I am in there getting clothes out of the closet to wear. I go over and try to rescue the babies. Paulina is angry at Lance and I realize the marriage is about to be over.
