I started downstairs, sliding down two banisters. But when I got off, realized I had left my shoes. While I was putting them on I saw it was __:29 and I was due for psychology class tests and hurried on, wondering if my apron would be all right there. When I got to the school building it was registration. I did not know where I was expected. Started along hall looking in every door.
