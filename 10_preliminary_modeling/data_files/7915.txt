There was something about me taking my car to get it looked at or get an estimate or semi-fixed. I went back to the house but I didn't want to go to work. I told Mother and Daddy that I didn't feel well and I wasn't going to work. I knew I was lying but I didn't think they did. I realized I would need to act sick now so they wouldn't say anything. We were watching TV. There was more about my car but I can't remember it now.
