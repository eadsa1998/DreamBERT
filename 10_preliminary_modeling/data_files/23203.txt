It was rather late, and my wife Anita was waiting for me at home.  I was on a street corner, and some student whom I don't remember asked me if I wanted to ride in Annabelle Knapson's new car.  I accepted.  Annabelle Knapson was there, as was Ellen Cohen.  The interesting thing about the car was not that it was new but that it was a convertible, with the driver's seat in the middle front seat.  I had never seen a car like that.  While we were driving, I wanted something to eat, and we stopped at a big (tall) vending machine.  At first I thought it had candy bars, but when I went to buy something, I couldn't find any.
