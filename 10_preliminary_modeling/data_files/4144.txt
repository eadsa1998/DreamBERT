Charla is a beautiful child preparing for making it big in Hollywood. I am her chaperone and helper. She has perfect blonde hair in a bouffant style. We are at a place where the Hollywood hopefuls come to train and be discovered. There are hundreds of them. I am filled with love and pride of how beautiful Charla is. The scene is surrealistic, neither indoor or outdoor. No walls. Charla is tap dancing. I say that tap dancing is a strange style of dance. A narrator remarks that there is always one or two specially talented people that come in and are recognized immediately.  One dances by. Charla is trying to sneak past me wearing three different dresses, one on top of the other. She's trying to meet a young boy somewhere. I tell her she can't fool me. I tell her to go back. Another woman is around. Now I am flying in some sort of structure like a parking garage. Only this is where artists who didn't make it are stuck forever. It's the Loser Highway. The flying space is like the curved way cars drive in parking garages. I see other losers caught in there, one man tethered to the structure and trying to fly. It is very sad. Another man is heart broken because he created wonderful artistic pictures in there but now that he is trying to return to regular earth, the pictures disintegrate and are ruined. All his talents and work destroyed. Now I am told to fly over the producer's desk. I fly over there. He is a big noisy man. Flashy dresser.
