I was lying on my back on a bed. A woman came and pressed her belly against mine. Her menstruating blood spilled on me. (When I awoke, I reflected that when I recall more than one dream, the last one is the only one that is ever sexual in nature. I recalled that before this dream about the woman, I had a dream, but I did not recall its content except that I knew it was not a sexual dream. It was something about my taking a place at a meeting.)
