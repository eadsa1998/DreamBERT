Am in a large barn-like structure on the estate of my firm's boss. There are many employees there and we all awaken early for a sort of picnic breakfast to which the boss has invited us and arranged for everything to be prepared. He walks in with his wife and several family members. The women are fashionably dressed, really overdressed and overly made up, and I look at them and suspect they would have all preferred to remain in bed, but that the boss forced them to come.
