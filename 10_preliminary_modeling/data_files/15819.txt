I was on the forum and Benjamin posted saying he had been flirting with this girl for ages and she was finally his girlfriend and something like 'Izzy will be happy for me'. I went to his Facebook and his profile photo was of them together. She was quite ugly. There were tons of pictures from April 2014 of him on a cheap looking film set and it looked like that's where they'd met. I was annoyed.
