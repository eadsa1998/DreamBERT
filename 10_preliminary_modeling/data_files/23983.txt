This dream was more like a flash than a story. A girl named Carla was riding her bike off a road near to where I live. She is a 7th grade girl at the junior high. She also takes a dance class with me. She was riding to school when I saw her from afar. I don't know what direction I was in relationship to her. She didn't see me. The entire dream I was just an observer. I knew what time it was in the dream. It was 8:30 am. I thought, "I hope she makes it to school on time." I felt nervous at the time that she might not get to school on time, but I quickly brushed the feelings off. This is all I remember.
