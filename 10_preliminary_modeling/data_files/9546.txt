I go to Church in my nightgown: I am desperate. I sit on the floor, but then someone shows me to a seat. --also see a city in the moonlight on the way. --I come home to find Nevena and Paul (Father Andrew's children) at our house; Father Andrew and Marissa have left on a short trip and we are to put them to bed. --Suddenly they are babies--and there is the pacifier routine. When Father Andrew comes to pick them up there is only Nevena; he says to Frank: Hello Agape--and talks to him (Frank) as he sits with his bare feet up on a baby table. Father Andrew has on civilian clothes. --After a while see the Alexanders (friends) and the K.'s (Zena's godparents) and others all dressed up for Church. Roxanne has tears in her eyes, as if going to a funeral. I ask who, but don't recall their answer. See Father Andrew in black funeral vestments. He is coming in the door, smiles and says something about a quick change.
