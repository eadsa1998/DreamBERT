A man was hanging by the shoulders in the air from a plane going overhead. He held onto a cable. It was a stunt. Later I was on a train. I had to show a pass to get on. I stopped at a place. I got off. Some animals were nearby. Later I was trying to use a logical proposition to explain a human event.
