 I'm at the pond near Armstrong High School with my friends Niles Zelling and Hilary Nano. We are there to do something with canoes; maybe trying out wood or plastic paddles. We are waiting for someone. We're down by the pond fishing. There are some little sunnies that don't bite my line. Hilary gets a bite and reels in a black bear cub! She lifts it up by the line. I'm going to cut the line. The bear starts eating its way up the line, so I cut it halfway up the pole. The bear falls to the ground when I cut it. It looks like it's in pain. I'm afraid the mother bear will come to help it, so I run away. I cross Home Avenue, as if I were at home, and as I do I look up. On an invisible plane above my house is the mother bear, pacing. I run in the alley of the block between Home and Next Avenues. There are dogs in cages that lunge towards me as I run by. They are all around me. There is a dragon. It is evil: the devil. It is flying out from an eerie orangish-colored full moon. I am running back up the alley of my block, towards home. I can run and jump 20 or 30 feet in the air, touching branches high over the alley. The dragon is the devil, and it comes swirling out of the moon. I send all my powers to combat it. Some asked me if it was evil. I lied and said no.
