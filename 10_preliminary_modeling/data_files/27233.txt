I dreamed I had received an invitation to join one sorority and my friend had been asked to join another. I can remember in my dream that I preferred the latter and wondered why I was not asked to join. One of the girls in the sorority which had asked me to join told me that she knew I really didn't like them and that I had told everyone that they did not date very often. The scene shifted to one of the sorority houses (none of them have any). Someone was telling me that "our house"--presumably I was living at an independent student dorm similar to one in which I lived while at the U--- of W--- would have to break up next semester because all of the girls were moving into sorority houses. I was very perturbed because my friends would all be separated and, since my sorority did not have a house, I would have no place to live.
