I dreamt I was with a group of boys and girls of about my age, friends of mine and schoolmates, and we were talking pleasantly and playing around. I felt happy to be with them. At one point I began to feel a different way about one of my classmates than I did about the others. I think I felt in love with him and he with me. Then I saw us separating from the general group and we went to a very nice place near a river where he spoke to me of love and I felt myself blushing, without being able to explain it. But I also felt that I loved him very much and that was all I dreamt.
