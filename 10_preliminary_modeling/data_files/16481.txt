I still have to think about that sometimes! [the year] I can't remember too much about what I was dreaming last night, but I know that, I remember one scene real vividly. I dreamt that I think I might have been at either Aunt Christine's house or at some other strange house. But I had a feeling like it was somebody's house that I had just been to the first time. And I didn't really know the people, and they had like an upper second story, and they had a living room real similar to ours. And then they had a cellar and the stairs are just like ours except they were a lot less steep, they went at a much more gradual grade for a much longer period of distance. And I had to go get something from in their cellar, and, oh no, I think I had to go to the bathroom down there. And what you had to go is you had to go down the steps, and then there was like a hallway, and to your right was a bathroom, to the left was some other kind of junk room, and if you kept going straight and down a couple more steps, you'd have an even deeper, darker cellar. And by the way, in all of this, there was one light switch at the head of the stairs that controlled the lights for all three of those rooms down there and the stairway. And I had to go to the bathroom and somebody was in the first story bathroom, and I was going down the stairs of the cellar, and it didn't actually happen, but I was having a vision of what would happen if somebody were to see the door open and the light on, and they just switched off the switch and everything went dark, how I would just scream! And after that thought, I decided I wasn't going to go to the bathroom down there, that I was going to hold it some more. So then I woke up, and I really had to go. [laugh]
