I was in this hotel lobby. Calvin, Samantha and others were there too. We were talking about something and Calvin said whenever we do certain things, Eugene is near us. Samantha was like "Well, at least we know she (me) likes Eugene". Eventually, I said "Ok, well he (the person I like) doesn't have an 'I' in is name". I was thinking of Dmitri and Daryl who were nearby. We were then at school, I think. At first we were in a little room and we had to play this game. This double agent lady unlocked a door and let us through. Each person had to use a different key. The first time I barely made it through because the bad guy came and was shooting. The second time, I got through quickly. Elijah got through as well. We had to run and go through some water and get onto this little raft, then go onto land and run up these stairs. The stairs led up to this weird broken building. The bad guy got in with a hostage. Eric Mabius was there. I said "What's your name in this, Eric?" and he said "What? My middle name?" and I said no and then he said "Oh! My name in this is Cockwell". I explained that the bad guy had infected the hostage guy with a virus. If we had it, he was contagious and we would die. I went looking for medicine. I found a book called "Stop on Lily" and I had a random flashback (I'd done it before). You weren't allowed to shoot your enemy once they were on your turf. Someone got autographs and photos with Greg and David from Big Brother 2005.
