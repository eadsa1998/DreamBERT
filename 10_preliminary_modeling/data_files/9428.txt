I go back to B. City to see Dr. Smith. Many changes. I hear he is being transferred to St. Maxon. Much confusion, but despite all difficulties I manage to see Dr. Smith. Wonderful hour. Feel more equal to him now. Later I ask him: "Don't you think I should come out tomorrow?" He says: "Yes, I think you should" and I repeat, smiling, "Yes, I think I should too." Shift: RR station near St. Maxon surrounded by hills. I am driving along and see my former upstairs neighbor. Happy to see him. We walk arm and arm and I feel he still loves me. He asks if I want to go along skiing with him. Very happy. I remark, "We're now living in the Schlegel house." (Note: Schlegels = friends from Vienna who were very wealthy)
