I was being chased for what seemed a long time. At times I was running and other times I was in an automobile. My pursuer seemed to change from one person to another; however I could recognize none of them. The pursuer was male. Finally I entered the house where I lived and in so doing found that I was cornered. Suddenly I found my service pistol (.45 cal., automatic) in my hand. As I was running up the stairs to escape I turned to shoot my pursuer. At that time his visage became clear. He was a professor of mine from the physics department of the university. I tried to pull the trigger, but it seemed frozen. As I tried to pull it with the use of both my hands, I was about to be pounced on. At that point I awakened.
