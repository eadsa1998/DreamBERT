I took someone's white pickup truck for some reason, and headed up the street a few houses stopping in front of Gail's house. I get out and ask her if I can use her bathroom, and then ask where the bathroom is. She tells me, I use it, then come out. There's a police officer looking for me. He asks me a question about some card or license he's holding, asking if it was mine. I am a little nervous, just realizing that I was driving without a license. Then I'm in a mall, shopping, and eventually an officer is looking for someone who fits my description. He finds Chris and says that, from the back, he looks just like me. I have a bunch of stuff I'm going to buy, and going through the register I quickly think of stealing everything in my bag. Then I realize I'm in enough trouble as it is, so I take a candy bar and my money out of the bag, and just buy this.
