I was going downstairs in my home and I noticed a sticker on the outside of the window on my front door. It was a UPS sticker that they leave when they tried to deliver a package and I wasn't home. I wondered how long it had been there and surprised that I hadn't seen it earlier. I opened the front door just far enough to reach out and pull the sticker off of the window and then closed the door back up. I was thinking about when I could get to the office to pick it up and also wondering what it was. I didn't remember ordering anything.
