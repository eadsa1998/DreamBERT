I'm at a Japanese restaurant. I have a wallet full of cash. A man and a woman in the next booth steal my wallet. I see them put it in her purse. I yell, "Hey look, somebody. They stole my money." I could see it and pointed to it, but no one would believe me. Then they stare at me. The hit man held a gun to my head and said, "I could just kill you right now." I smiled and leaned back and said, "Please do." I waited, but he chose not to. I felt disappointed. They took me to a playing court (like tennis courts.) The woman had stolen me because I have great artistic ideas and she wants to paint them. She's standing at an easel trying to paint. I sit down. She says, "I could just make you love me. But I won't." "Good," I said, putting my feet up (I'm Walter Brennen), "because it would never work!" We are in a small courtyard off the main one with sliding glass and wooden doors like in Japanese homes.
