I found myself in a strange room and a strange man seated at a desk (age ?). In front of the desk stood my former husband holding some books. I couldn't see his face because I was standing some distance behind, but the outstanding thing in this dream was the bright blue shirt he was wearing which had a large tear in the right sleeve. I do not recall the conversation, but remember leaving the room and crossing into another room which was very familiar--that is--I knew I had lived there before. This room was very dilapidated and messy. I then awoke.
