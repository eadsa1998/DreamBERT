["Heart Attack"]  I live in a large building downtown. I go outside and talk to two women who are going to do some work for me, but I haven't been doing the work I need to do, before they can do their work. I tell them I'll get right to it. I don't really want to, but I feel obligated to say that. They are both sitting in rocking chairs. They know I don't really mean what I said. I tell them one of the rocking chairs needs to be put back in the house for me. They agree. I go back into the house, the Work Barn section. I am feeling overwhelmed by all the work to do. I lie down and feel a heart attack. I become unconscious. I then revive and dial 911 on a telephone. A woman operator asks me if I need help. I say with difficulty yes. I've had a heart attack. I'm in the work barn part of the house. I can't remember the address. I struggle to remember, thinking it might be Connecticut. I blurt out my name, Barb Anders. She assures me someone will come to help. I have another heart attack and become unconscious  again.
