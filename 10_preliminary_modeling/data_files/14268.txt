I was at 'school'. School had just finished and we had to go back for a little while. It was only for a few weeks. Depending on which group of last names we belonged to, we were allocated two lots of a few days of holiday. The first one was A-D, but the next one started with D-something and I was in that one. We only had one set of holiday, which was like 3 days in the middle of the weeks. I complained to a female teacher as everyone else had longer ones and had two, so she gave us another one. I was then in a class with a new male teacher. He asked me to introduce myself and I shook my head, he kept saying "I can't hear you" and so I said "Well, I'll just leave then" and walked out. I called Mom and she said she couldn't get me because she had no, but she was out in the Mighty and I said "You're in the Mighty! How have you got no car?" and she was silent.
