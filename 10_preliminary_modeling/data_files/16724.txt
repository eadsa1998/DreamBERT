[this is a dream] I think I woke up on a couch with several people I knew from school. I was still hearing music in my head from the "dreams," and it wasn't completely pleasing me. I talked to Frank about it, and he asked me if I was hearing the "beating trumpets". For some reason, the thought of any instrument with that description- very ominous, "beating trumpets"- frightened me. I told him yes, because he just brought it up, and he got terribly afraid, curling back in fear. The way in which he did this was actually humorous, when I think about it. He was about to run away, and I was really afraid and needed him with me at that point. I wanted to just relax and watch TV together. I didn't want to be alone so I told him, ok, I'm not hearing the sounds anymore. He came back and I asked, "Is that music coming from the tv?" Everyone else thought it was a dumb question. Well, actually everybody laughed, thinking I was joking. I think Warren responded that it was coming from the TV. Then I was in a building that I made out to be the "QRS Video Store" and tape rentals were less than $1. I had money to buy one, so I rented a video. I don't remember which one or if I even knew at the time. Next, I'm in a big, old, general or surplus store where most of the place wasn't even being used. There were a couple sections where I could buy CD's, and I'd been wanting to replace my Moxy Fruvous CD that I lost (really) so I thought I'd buy one, but wasn't sure between that and another CD I wanted. Then, on the way back, I'm with my school and we get on this floor space that turns into a whitewater raft. All of a sudden there are like 8 people on the raft, which I made to be way too much. Furthermore, they were mostly people from outside of school. We were diving into the water. They dived over me, and I thought I would drown and not be able to get enough air.
