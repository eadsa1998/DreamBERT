Stefan Stefan everywhere. I send him these sheets of paper with information about some hick white trash family named the T...'s. It's some funny stuff. He calls me late at night. there is a contest - I dont know what first prize is but the general jist is that the contestants have to drink lemonade. I am confused about the actual rules. There is a stairwell with these HUGE gallon tanks of lemonade - but also other tanks (like big plastic milk containers but HUGE) with a more opaque and thick creamy beige substance. I am confused about what to do and go to ask the rules but by that time the game is over and there is a winner. Someone won hours ago. <br/
