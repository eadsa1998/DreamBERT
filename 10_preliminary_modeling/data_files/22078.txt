It seemed to me that I was in the dormitory, and I found a friend of mine there who was taking care of the dorm, very seriously, just as the proctor does. While he was walking, I was going through the dorm, and suddenly I found Marcia, a girlfriend of 17 or 18 years of age, who I used to love. I greeted her by taking her face in my two hands. Her face seemed to be very rough. Then the proctor arrived (my friend, aged 25) and told me angrily that one shouldn't rap in the dorm, and I don't remember any more. In the dorm there were many beds, about 100 of them.
