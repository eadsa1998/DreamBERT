There were a lot of people around. I don't know where we were or what was going on. I did something that caused me to cut my ring finger on my left hand, right on the outside pad of the finger. I didn't think it was very bad and was holding a tissue over it while I waited for someone to get me a band-aid. I pulled the tissue away once or twice to look at it and see if it was still bleeding. It was. Whoever had gotten the band-aid, unwrapped it for me. As I pulled the tissue away and began to put the band-aid on it started bleeding again right away and very quickly soaked the band-aid with blood. I thought it would be fine, that the band-aid would make it stop bleeding. I wasn't going to worry about it. But I noticed just seconds later that blood was seeping out from under the band-aid. I grabbed another tissue to soak up the blood. Now the blood is almost gushing it's coming out so quickly and so much. My whole had looks like it is covered in blood. I can't soak it all up with the tissue. I rush to a sink so blood doesn't drip onto the floor. A woman who is a nurse comes to help. She snaps at two other people to help. One of them she tells to get some things from the first-aid cabinet and tells them specifically what to get. She is telling the other one that they need to apply pressure to get the bleeding to stop, but she is doing that. I'm wondering if I will need to stitches or if she will be able to stop the bleeding and take care of it without me needing to go to the doctor or hospital. It almost seems that I'm in the basement of my birth home where Daddy had enclosed underneath the staircase so that space could be used for storage but have the stuff being stored hidden from sight. Facing the bottom of the staircase I am to the right, where the washer and dryer and water heater are. There was no sink in the basement in waking life.
