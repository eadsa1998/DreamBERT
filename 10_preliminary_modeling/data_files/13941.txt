Someone was saying that I was one of the few people who checked up on previous Big Brother contestants, pointing out Tim Brunero as an example. Someone checked up to see who he was sleeping with, including myself, but he wasn't sleeping with anyone. I was at Mom's, then I was at school and I had an accounting test. Ezra had some test results. Ms Pascal saw my phone and gave me this other thing to use instead. Someone said "I'm John Lennon". There was a video on Youtube of Kevin Spacey, but it was actually a photo of him.
