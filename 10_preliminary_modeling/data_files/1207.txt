I am in a room with lots of other people. We are hostages or prisoners. A woman has a gun on us. She's going to kill us. I am afraid but also resolved. I must try to save myself, my daughter Ellie, and the others. She points a gun at me and says, "If you move I'll shoot." I stand up. She then says, "If you keep it up, I'll kill your daughter." I hug Ellie and apologize but I know this is the only way. She understands. I love her and tell her so. I then pick up a gun and fire 6 bullets into her but they must have been blanks because she's smiling at me, unharmed. I feel a little unnerved, like, "Did I make a bad mistake?" I call out to the others. I say, "We've only got 5 minutes to live! She'll kill us! We might as well try to do what we can! What will be lost?!" A woman stands near another gun. I realize that I need the "cap" off the hammer. That's why my gun didn't work. She tries to get it apart. The bad woman notices, and she marches everyone outside to execute them. I grab her gun and kill her. Now I look around. I'm in a huge city but it's been nuked. There are no lights but the few we generated in our area. I walk around the block. I look to my right to see swirling fog, a sinister feeling. I hurry back to the lights. A man and a woman say they're going for a walk, after being cooped up for so long. I say, "O.K." I watch the spot light beam on the clouds and hear airplanes. Rescue! Then I see a huge fire engine with men and women rescue teams on it. They see us and stop. They come over. A man walks toward me. I begin crying in relief. I hug him and he me. It is such a good comforting hug! I cry and cry. Then it is necessary to leave at once. The mutants are growling and screaming in the fog; they are coming for us. I mourn the man and woman who must have been killed by them.
