My family was helping Brian F and someone else move and then they helped me move. Or I might have been living with Brian F and they were helping us both move but into separate homes. I was moving into a condo on the right side of North Point Bay. When we were at Brian F's there were boxes piled chest-high everywhere. There was little room to walk. I was helping to sort them by who they belonged to. I was standing outside of where I live now, a little distance away, looking at the front of the building. It looked very different than in waking life. It reminds me more of the way some condos are laid out, with individual driveways and six or more steps leading up to the front door. I was thinking about some of the neighbors and that it was kind of sad that I had lived here for so long but I didn't know anyone well enough for them to be sad that I was moving, or even realize that I had moved.
