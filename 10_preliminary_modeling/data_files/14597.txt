I think there was a monster. I was outside somewhere, jumping on the roof and walls to get away. Then it was Buffy (Buffy the Vampire Slayer). She got to the 'end' and they were going to kill her but she walked away. Then she was shown images of her friends and family on fire so she went back and sacrificed herself.
