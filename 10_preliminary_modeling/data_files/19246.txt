I had a dream that my friend moved back to Minnesota from Maryland. He is 17. In my dream it was day time and we were just talking and getting reacquainted because we haven't seen each other for six years. I was happy in my dream because (I think) it is something which I really want to happen. I dreamed that we went rollerblading with him and two of our other friends, the two which I got his address from.
