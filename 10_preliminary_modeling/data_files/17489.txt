I was trying to turn in my paper and get to the final on time.  I got on a bus.  Some people sat down and I asked for my baby blanket back- they had sat on it.  It was pulled into 3 parts.  A sympathetic woman made it sound like she would mend it for me.  Off the bus I was in the middle of nowhere.  I lost the nice woman.  A volcano was erupting behind me.  I couldn't see the actual volcano, but the lava was close.  I had to maneuver around loose rocks and figure out where to go.  Some man called to me and I followed, but I wondered if the event was apocalyptic and running was in vain.
