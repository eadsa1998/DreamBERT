 I'm playing poker with my brother Wally and sisters Ramona and Heather. We are playing "7-card no peek". The cards are dealt two down and one up to start. I have a four face up. Wally changes wild cards from twos and fours to twos and fives. I get mad and say he can't change wild cards after he has dealt cards face up! In my anger, more cards are flipped over. I get a five. I raise the pot two dollars to force everyone to fold. Wally and Heather fold. Ramona is in. Ramona ends up with eight cards: she drew too many. I get mad because she drew extra cards and I would have gotten some of the cards, had she only drawn seven cards. I tell her to just bet, even though I have only seven cards. Ramona has five aces. I have a royal straight flush in spades, using three wild cards. I could also have five aces, but I say I have a royal straight flush because I know more about poker than she does.
