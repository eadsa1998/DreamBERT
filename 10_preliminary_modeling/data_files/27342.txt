I dreamed I had a girl over for dinner. The girl is 20 &amp; I know her fairly well as she is in my class. After dinner, I told her I hoped she enjoyed being at my house to eat. She said the food was fine, but that she had not had enough water. She said my father "hogged" the water pitcher &amp; drank so much that when she wanted some it was all gone. She enumerated other things which weren't done the way her family does them. I can't remember what they were but I felt pretty bad about it.
