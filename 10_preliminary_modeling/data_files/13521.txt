I was at a friend of mine's house. It was her birthday. She had these ponds and there were walkways on top. There were lots of fish and I was telling her about how Nana had similar fish and told her about the big ones that suck on your finger. She had even bigger ones. She took a fish out and put it onto the walkway. I put it back in and said "You're gonna kill it!". She had a party and hadn't invited her best friend (ex) who was Leighton Meester and some stuff happened (the lights went out etc) and she suspected Leighton but it wasn't her.
