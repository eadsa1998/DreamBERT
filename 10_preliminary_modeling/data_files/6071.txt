My second dream consisted of two of my good friends. One is my best friend, Trina. Well, I was at my girlfriend's house (Trina), at least it looked like her house. The view was kind of foggy. I was climbing up her banister in her apartment. (She doesn't even have a banister in real life.) Anyway, I don't know why I was climbing up her banister. The next thing I knew, I saw her father-in-law arguing with this woman who he was supposed to be dating. He was trying to tell them both that it was over. Their names were Mary and Toni. So after a while I found myself outside with Trina and Pam. We were going out to eat. We walked by the Boston Common. All of a sudden, Trina started collecting popsicle sticks. She would eat the ice cream and then she would save the sticks. Trina gave the sticks to some guy so he could make a funny object (a doll stick). The next thing I knew Trina and Pam were fighting over the pendant that Trina had found. Then I woke up.
