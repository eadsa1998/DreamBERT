The dream concerned California. We had been talking about CA last night to somebody who lived there. The place that I was in, in CA, was exactly the way he had described it. The way I sort of pictured it in my mind. No place would actually look this way and we, my husband and I, and I believe this other person who is an instructor in psychology, were driving along and were going to some university there. When we got there, he was pointing out various places to us. I was interested in the prices of food there. I was trying to find out if they were very much different from what they are here and they weren't. When we got to this university, it seems that all the professor there were sort of in this tight little group or maybe several tight little groups who just kept all their knowledge and research to themselves and didn't tell anybody else about it, and they used code to send little cryptic messages to one another, but they didn't communicate what they were doing to anybody else and we, my husband and I, were trying to get this information. It was sort of dangerous. It was more like a spy ring than faculty members, but we were trying to get some of this information and messages away from them.
