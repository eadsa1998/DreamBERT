We had some of our friends call us and say that they couldn't come down to visit us because their kid had something stuck in his finger. We said we could get it unstuck by sticking it in one of my mother-in-law's kids, the youngest one. We had to go downtown to the department store to do this. So  we went downtown to the department store, and the thing stuck because it was cold. It was frozen. My mother-in-law's kids, they had instructions coming over a loudspeaker how to pick up this little frozen thing, and we were concerned that she wouldn't do it. She picked it up and it stuck to her finger. The scene kind of changed and we were home eating, and I was serving sliced ham and roast beef or something like that. A roast. I sliced it all up and put it on all the plates and passed it all around. Then the whole family sat down to eat. There was my family and I think it was my aunt's family. We got finished eating and my aunt wasn't too happy because she didn't get enough roast. She was implying that this was my fault. I think the roast was hers to begin with, but I said there was plenty of more ham left and she could have a slice of ham. She didn't want a slice of ham, and then I said it was her own fault because I didn't tell her where to sit or anything, and the plates were all served before anybody sat down. That's where you came in. Day residue: The thing on the end of the finger was symbolic of a wart I've been trying to get removed on my finger. I was down to the clinic the other day, and they said come back when the dermatologist is here, etc. So I have to go back to get it removed.
