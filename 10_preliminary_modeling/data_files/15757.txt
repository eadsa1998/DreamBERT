I went to the cinema that was at a shopping centre. I took my shoes off (as did most people) and when it finished I started walking back to my car when I realised I didn't have shoes on. I ran back and they had been cleaning the cinema. I asked someone there if they'd found any shoes and they said no. I went back to my row and couldn't see any shoes. I found a black pair of sneakers in another row that fit, so put those on, but then went back to my row and looked underneath my chair and found mine. I put them on and thought maybe I should get some black sneakers for work while I'm here but I wasn't sure where the shoe shop was. Somehow I ended up losing my shoes again and went looking for them. I had a dream about Big Brother and it involved Ashleigh, Helen and Mark (who was a director in the middle of making a big film) and I posted on Facebook instead of writing it in a note on my phone. Everything was shortened and the grammar was really bad and Dan Palmer liked it and some other people as well (Ashleigh's 'brother' for one). Later, we were parked in North Midvale carpark and I was in my car and Mom was in her car. It was dark and was creepy. I looked in Mom's window and she turned and had this like giant blue snake tongue and zombie like eyes and face. I ran back to my car and didn't know what to do.
