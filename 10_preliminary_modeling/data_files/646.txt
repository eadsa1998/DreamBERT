I just got out of car with my son and daughter and I put groceries away and go for a walk in a mountainous area. My son is putting a swing set in place and can't get it to stay. Then he is able to fix it. Just as that happens my daughter is coming to see me, slips and slides. I tell her to grab something to hang on to. She gets a short branch and I go to help her. I reach for her hand but my wrists are very weak and I'm afraid I won't be able to pull her up.
