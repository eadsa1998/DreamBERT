I had a dream that we were back at school and already Judith and I were taking tests, something about being proctors. We had to choose people to live on our floor. Then it was back to the summer again, and the Dunns were at our house, and we were servants or something. Aidan came into my room, and we were sort of fooling around until we all had to catch our plane to Italy. My mother and I made the flight, but my brother and father missed it.
