I see my mother rushing to help Aunt Rosalie. My mother straightens up some clothes and puts them where she wants them, even though Rosalie has different ideas. My mother is pushy and controlling. I turn to Aunt Millie and say, "She is so annoying." Aunt Millie says, "You should have seen her as we grew up!" I see my mother's intense, determined, angry face and I think, "How sad, that was my mother, my 'nurturing' part." [BL]
