The scene was by a canal with the sun shining and with green grass and flowers growing. Lots of little girls were playing all different games. Everyone was happy and smiling. Then we began playing red rover. Most of the girls I didn't know--those I did were mere acquaintances of mine at Ohio Wesleyan. They didn't call me for a long time then several times in a row. Then I got tired of all the kids and went home. Our front door was freshly painted white with gold numbers beginning with '1' and I thought to myself that a home shouldn't begin with a number '1'. While I was watching the '1' became an 'f'. Then I walked out in back behind the house. Daddy and mother were sitting in a rowboat fishing and mother was dangling her feet in the water. Mother was wearing blue jeans.
