A guy had seen an ad in the paper for alternative space. We went with him, me and a stranger. The guy was an out-of-state naive ex-con who fell for the "$3.00 admission at the door" trick: to enter an empty building. 3 bums total were lying in the foyer. 2 kept sleeping the whole time the admission transaction was transpiring. The list was on the door. (The list had) 3 columns. 30Bw was the lowest number, center column. It was listed in the "no heat at night or on weekends" grouping. I had been through that "no residential heat" after business hours saga and I had second thoughts.
