On the subway. The first time I'd gone because it was raining and my fishing documentary film had been cancelled. I knew the fish wouldn't care if it was raining because they were already wet but nobody asked me. That time I'd walked home from 23 St. after taking the subway to there, it was a 23 mile walk. The second time I took the subway; I did not know where I was going. Mostly because my room was a mess and starting to smell and I needed to ask someone if I could take a shower in their bathroom because there was too much junk on the floor of my shower. On the train I met people from foreign countries. Many OBVIOUSLY different nationalities were speaking shared languages--though 3 or 4 conversations in different languages were going on simultaneously. The guy asked me, "Where are you going?" And I said, "I don't know." And he said, "What?" And I said, "I don't know." And he said, "What?" (for the third time) And I said, "I don't know. " ...and he looked at me funny so I said, "I can't pronounce things because I have a cold." And he said, "Oh." When I got to the diner at the 23 St. exit my bike was parked outside and had a tag that said, "FOR SALE" and I was about to tear it off when I saw a note in red ink that said, "Merri, I paid a visit to your bicycle on your mother's front porch. -- Love, Zeb" I was so happy Zeb had been somewhere close to me even if I had been asleep. I'd been collecting banana stickers and sticking them on everything around me and then the sticky stuff and 2 paper layers started coming apart. I went out walking. I was in search of army men--whole bags of them at the 99 cent store. There was only one bag of army men but I only had one dollar.
