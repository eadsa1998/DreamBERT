 I'm at a restaurant where my friend Nate Nelling is working as a cook. I see my friend Marge Drummond in a booth, and go sit with her. My friend Emily Zates is there, having a gin and tonic. I had a bloody nose earlier in the day and there is crusty dry toilet paper in the inside of my nose from this. My friend Mya Rousing is there. She may see the toilet paper. I eat a mushy onion and pepper-covered tortilla. I'm going into a place that is Grocery Getto, though it looks like a church. I see a man who appears to be the assistant manager of the store, Mike Johnson. He is on a four-wheeler. I think of writing a dream pamphlet for this church-like place. I walk into the building. Nothing is happening upstairs. I go downstairs, where I find my brother Wally watching a movie with my classmate Rachel Steiner, on the couch. When I see them I don't want to be there. I make the conversation terse, and say I'm tired, and leave. I disrespect Rachel. I don't want to see or talk to her.
