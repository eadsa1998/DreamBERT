I blow up my house - there's nitro in a suitcase I have to be careful with and I do something wrong - I know it and have just enough time to get out. I manage to scream for Lick and don't see him but I think I see him shortly after - then I feel a little relieved, though not happy, that I got out alive and at least I didn't lose anybody, till I remember MB and Tree - then I'm (stunned? horrified?)
