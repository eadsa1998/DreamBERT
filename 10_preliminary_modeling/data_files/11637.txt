This dream began in the university parking lot. On my way to class I ran into a member of the faculty and I remember our exchanging remarks about his new car. Following this I found myself aboard an airliner bound for Florida. Again in this scene was the same member of the faculty and likewise we exchange some remarks which I am unable to recall. The last scene of this dream transpired on the front porch of my house. From where I was sitting I saw a large airplane fly over my house and as it was flying along it fired several blasts releasing a cloud of black smoke each time. The plane landed on the street and as it landed it became a much smaller craft. A woman (age 30) a friend, got out. I asked her to take me up for a ride, but she refused because she had just paid $3000 for a new carburator. Dream ended at this point.
