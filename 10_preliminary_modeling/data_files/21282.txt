I was at the track and a #11 won the first race and the next one was 3 sixes, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, like this 6 6 6. So a 11 and 6 won first and second races. Julia Gibson was there. I kissed her on the cheek. Ernie Koelpin was doing some kind of cooking at the finish line. Carter Kotnik and a few other guys were there. I had some mixed nuts, which I ate and offered to some of the boys. I tried to sleep and dream of the next winner, but couldn't. I played pp. 11 for in the second race, but 6 6 6 won.
