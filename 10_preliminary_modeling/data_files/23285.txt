I was waiting to watch, or take part in, some carnival games.  The first one involved gymnastics.  Someone I was with, or at least knew, took part, but I didn't.  She did a back flip; I thought it must be nice to be able to do that, and for a moment I did it in my mind, sort of testing to see if I thought I could do it, but I decided it wasn't worth the risk.  Then there was some kind of game involving a big pile of tiny yellow glass beads.  There were four such piles on a flat area, each attended by a different person.  They gave you a flat implement sort of like a can opener, with a flat hook at one end, but I couldn't figure out what you were supposed to do with it.  I asked a few people, but couldn't get an answer that I could understand or remember.  This went on a long time.  Finally, it was so late that the game closed, and I went on to play softball.  There was a game going on, and I was catching.  There was only one batter; they were playing workup, I guess.  The batter hit the ball to deep left center.  The fielders didn't do much to try to catch it or to retrieve it.  Everyone was just standing around.  I was frustrated, and ran all the way to the outfield fence from the catcher's position and retrieved the ball-so that I could bat.  I told the pitcher to come in and catch and someone else was supposed to pitch.  I picked up the bat, for the first time in a game in a long time, and it felt really good.  I just wondered whether to bat right-handed or left-handed.  The right field fence was sort of like the "green monster" in Fenway Park-very close but very high.  Left field was much deeper.  I wanted to bat left handed, but knew I had a tendency to hit grounders from that side.  It would be very satisfying to hit a home run to left field, but I was afraid if I swung too hard I would pop up.  Unfortunately I never got the chance to make the choice, because that is when I woke up.
