Paul Whitehouse and I were friends and we swapped bodies. I had to go to the toilet at one stage and pulled down 'my' pants, but then didn't because I didn't want to touch his bits and didn't know what to do. I then complained to him about it. Then, Paul Whitehouse and Charlie Higson swapped bodies. I kept getting them confused. Paul (as Charlie) kept getting drunk. Charlie (as Paul) was annoyed that he was making him look stupid. We were on this bus thing and I lost my pen and was testing another one. I wrote 'Ted, Paul Whitehouse and Ralph'. I was then at home with some people and we were looking out the back door. Then we were in this forest and stuff from Deadbirds was happening, except I kept forgetting what happened. Ryan Merriman was there. There was this creature. These aliens were recruiting people. Some others came along.
