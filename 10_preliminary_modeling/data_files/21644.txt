I was in a tree with Ann. She was washing the floor. I could see her vagina. Two Negroes and a white man were walking under the tree looking up. I yelled a command at them. I said, "I will give you one minute to get off this property and if you are not, I'm going to use this shotgun on you. I'll blast you all to hell." I looked at my watch's second hand and was timing them. They were off before the time was up. Joe Arendas got angry at me and was battling me. I got the best of him, so he played me dirt. He got a big can of acid and was going to throw it at me, but it opened as he raised it over his head and the acid was jelled and it poured all over him. He came at me with this jell over him. I moved out of his way and he went away to get the stuff off his body. He got a little on me, so I went under a hose and was washing off the acid. I was with the Gotch boys, my boyhood friends. We were throwing rocks around. I seemed to have my Uncle Jake and others around. I was talking with a dead man. He said his heart was still beating, but now he didn't need any oxygen or breathing to do. I was close to him against his face.
