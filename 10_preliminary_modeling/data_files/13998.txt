I was at the exam place for chemistry. Eugene and I had become friends which I knew due to what Calvin and some others were saying. Calvin and I had to walk along this narrow ledge. Others were in front of us and these guys stopped to buy a drink from a stall. We got held up, so we jumped off but it was where the ledge basically ended. There was a mirror somewhere and it wasn't reflecting properly. Calvin ran into this cinema and I followed him. There was a weird movie playing and he left. This lesbian started talking to me and said her current girlfriend had thought she was a guy at first. I left there and was carrying lots of books and my calculator. Autumn dropped some of her stuff and thought she'd lost her calculator but she didn't. I went into this other cinema, where another weird movie was playing, which had a guy with red hair dancing. I was writing down books to use for my English exam and I had included A Clockwork Orange and written Anthony Burgess next to it. I was trying to remember the director of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, but I couldn't. I was trying to remember the "three hour movie" he did as well.
