The "highway" is this raging river with huge boulders in it. I get in a rubber raft and motor down to visit a friend. I get there and a young boy is annoyed at my visit. He wants to be alone. I hear an echo sound of waves and say, "Oh, you have a cave under the house." He denies it. It's his special place and he doesn't want a bunch of grown-ups messing up his place.
