Talking to Pam Ta about Sophia K not being at group lately and not hearing from her. I was telling Pam Ta how unusual that was. She had told me she wasn't going to be at one meeting but I haven't heard from her since. I was thinking about telling Pam Ta about this in an email. I was thinking that maybe Sophia K was doing this because the last time she missed I didn't write her to tell her we missed or anything. It's just very odd that she would not show up and not contact me.
