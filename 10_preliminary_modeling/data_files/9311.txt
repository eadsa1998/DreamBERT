I was in a large library and among ancient liver-spotted volumes. A tall, handsome scholar picked up and put down the heavy volumes. I knew him to be dying of a bad heart, the time unknown. He resembled both me and Robert Graves. He then picked up a hammer and pounded on a desk or table. At each blow, I would not have been surprised if he had dropped dead.
