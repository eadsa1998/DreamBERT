Some of my friends from school are hosting a large open-air concert or party. Saul seems to be in charge of it. Terry and Ralph are there too. Saul is unhappy with the quality of the sound system. He plays a CD which booms across the field and he gets more and more irate about it. I don't hear the problem, neither does Terry, but he behaves diplomatically.
