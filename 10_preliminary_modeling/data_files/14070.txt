I went out with Mom and we were walking. We saw Dad and Ezra come out of a building and walk down the steps. We went to this oval and I had to play some game. We had to control these bugs that ate certain things and also had to ride some and go through these circles around the place. The goals were listed like in Miss Management. We had been to the oval place for an excursion before.
