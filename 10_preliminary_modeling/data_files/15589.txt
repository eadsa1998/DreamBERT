I had a dream within a dream and was slightly aware. I was on a bed with Benjamin. He was behind me and I was pressed against him, but I didn't know why. My shirt had ridden up a little and I could feel a belt or something on my back. I wanted him to touch me, but he didn't. Then the blanket was 'aubergine' and I decided I wanted 'pancake', so it changed to a pancake coloured blanket, which 'smelt' like pancakes. When I woke up in the first dream, Mom and Darren were trying to work out what some pancake phrase meant -- I had written it in my sleep. I put on a bra and my right boob was 2x bigger than the left. I told Mom I needed to speak to her privately, but she was like 'just tell me' and I started to cry and made her come into my room. I told her and she was trying not to laugh and was like 'ok'. I had to get braces as well.
