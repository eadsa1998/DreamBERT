I am working for this very good-looking guy. The office is a mess. Piles of things are on the desk. I am trying to straighten it out and can't figure out where to put things. I pick up a poster and hang it on the wall. My boss stands close to me and as he is talking, I am aware of how attracted I am to him. I wonder how I can get his attention so he'll like me and find me attractive. He says, "That's a poster of Tony and someone is coming to the office that doesn't like Tony." I say, "Uh oh! Guess it was a mistake to put the poster up." He and I walk down some stairs. We start to walk through a cafe, but it is closed. Then we walk through the college bookstore to find the rest of the stairs. We continue our walk. We are now more like a couple. He wants some sunglasses and sees some on the side of the path. He chooses one that belonged to the S children. Somehow that was OK because the glasses came from descendants of Darryl.
