I was at the beach with Ezra and Dad. We had these skates which could walk on water. We had two different ones and we were going to try them out but I think we were a bit scared and were just sitting around. Little waves were splashing at the shore, but they kept getting bigger. I had my phone lying on the sand and a wave came right over it. I grabbed my phone to dry it and it was still ok. I ran back to the car to put my phone in there. The waves were still getting bigger and coming out further. There was an almost vertical step down to the shoreline now. I kicked at the sand to make it easier to walk down. I said we should leave. Nana lived nearby in this weird house and I went to warn her to put the pets inside and stay up high, when this wave came and hit the house. Somehow it hit the third storey, but we didn't get swept away with it. There was a cat on the second highest storey and I tried to get it to stay there. I ended up in a car and when the next wave hit, it lifted the car up and started sweeping me away. I started to panic and didn't know what to do.
