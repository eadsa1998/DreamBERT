I was at home at the end of the driveway near the wall. I had a rope to go across which was tight and in a triangular shape for me to walk across. Granma visited and commented on it. I was a spy or something. I can't remember what I did, but people left my stuff in a plastic bag in the middle of a busy shop. I found it and it had my phone, chocolate and keys in it. I went out to go to my car and this dodgy guy was outside. This other girl was out there and he asked her where some car was and she pointed and he went over. I went to my car and he came over and I unlocked it and he ran to the passenger side and I locked it. He ran over and I scratched and stabbed him with the key. I ran back into the shop and he stayed outside. Every time I went out, he was out there waiting. I asked some girls to distract him or sleep with him. They said no, and I said "but it's Adam Baldwin! Who doesn't want to hang out with Jayne?". Eventually I went out to confront him. Then it was a short time later and we were dating. He told me had actually liked me more every time I had gone out. I was like 'zomg *sigh*'. Also, I watched this episode of Misfits, but I only remember seeing Robert Sheehan and I was like "I can feel it in my balls!".
