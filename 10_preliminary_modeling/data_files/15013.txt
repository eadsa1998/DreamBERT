I was at the old house which was different. It was haunted or something. I was playing a game on my computer. I was in an elevator and I had to collect stuff to drink or I would lose health. The lighting wasn't very good in my room so it was hard to see. This ghost would come and at times it would just sort of [do something that I can't read] and then it would start making things bleed etc. He got an award at level 15 which meant that he had killed 15 people. My highest was four and I was determined to get it to 15 tonight. He smashed some stuff that I left behind. Then Ezra, this guy and I ran along train tracks to beat the train. There was also a photo of Cuddles and Gizmo.
