["Church Spies"]  I see two men and they seem suspicious. I follow them carefully. In looking at where they were being suspicious in the woods at the side of the road, I slip and slide down a steep embankment. Into a wooded area. As I am sliding and falling, I notice lots of docu,ments and papers. I see words that say church and realize these men have stolen important papers from the church. The men are looking for me, and I lie still in the undergrowth hoping they don't see me. Then other people start searching for me too, punk teens and so on. I start running through the woods and scramble up to the road. The church men are there and want me to come back to the church with them. I say no. I don't want to. I just want to leave. A school bus, for the church kids is there. I try to get on and stumble once or twice. The children stare at me and are not helpful. In fact, they are mean and not helpful.
