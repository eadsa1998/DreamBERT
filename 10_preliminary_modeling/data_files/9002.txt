Vince P had way too much to drink and I just wanted to get away from him because of that. Someone was going to take me away in their car so we walked to their car and I got in. I don't know if we left and came back and Vince P was still trying to approach me or if we just didn't get away from him. I was around him again later and he was still drinking and still wanting to have a conversation with me.
