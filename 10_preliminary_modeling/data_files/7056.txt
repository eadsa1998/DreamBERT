Talking about Eastern Star parade to members of my chapter. I say, "Our chapter has too many deadweights." The others agree ... Trying to get campus bridge together but can secure only two tables. Call to a friend seated at a window to ask if she would play tomorrow. She couldn't. Start home with two friends. Stop at Mrs. Wi. whom I had forgotten to ask. She tells me to dish up before I go. I told her that two people were waiting. But a child is dishing up. (Members of both organizations are women).
