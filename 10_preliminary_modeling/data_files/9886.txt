I am in a strange place: Father Andrew and Marissa come to visit. Marissa and I walk in a very narrow alley, she talks fast about her trip; then she runs across the sreet, wearing a red wig and a robe, to mail some letters; -- Later I am in the same house with them: hear Marissa crying, and Father comforting her; there is a maid, and a handsome man embraces me.
