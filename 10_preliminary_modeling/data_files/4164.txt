I am the Mother Of the Bride. My "daughter" is in a pink feathery foo-foo dress and I wear one like it. I take my position, standing at the left of the alter. I motion to the other Mother where she should stand, near me. During the ceremony, my "daughter" faints, lying on her side. I go to her and try to revive her. Now Dora is the bride. 2 minutes after she is married, she falls down dead. We are shocked and saddened.
