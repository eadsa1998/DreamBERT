I was working as a waitress at a huge party. The couples were older and very friendly. It was not like work at all. Then my old friend Andy showed up. I couldn't believe it. I hadn't seen him in almost a year. I was so happy. He brought me a gift of some clothes. I said I would finish up, change and meet him. I changed into a good-looking jean dress because I wanted to look good. When I walked out, he was not alone. Some of his friends that I know were there. Andy came up to me and said I looked great. He couldn't wait to see me. He hugged me and kissed me. Then I sensed that his wife Wendy was there. I was right. However, he said he was not going to be with her tonight. He wanted to spend time with me. I asked why, and he said it would be stupid not to. I wanted to know why he did not want to be with her. He was going to tell me... [the alarm went off, damn!].
