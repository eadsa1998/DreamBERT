Jayson stayed the weekend. On Saturday there was something happening at school. Jayson was on the phone to his mother, saying a poem so that he could stay another night. He came to the school and we had to wear uniforms and he sat next to me, but a bit further away. Calvin came and sat next to me. We were talking and I pointed to Jayson and I told him who he was. Then he started to get angry for some reason and kept leaning on me. There was a concert on and Mom said that Green Day was going to be there, so we went. Green Day came on, and when they left, we left and we got food.
