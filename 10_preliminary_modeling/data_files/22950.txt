I was in the agency building again-with a badge, but only for one day.  I thought that it was odd that they would take the trouble to clear someone and issue them a badge and debrief them-all for only one day of work.  I kept looking at my badge to convince myself that it was true. Then I was in a hospital ward, and one of the patients in there with me was Jim Plummer's wife, whose name was Rohda.  She was tall -- almost as tall as him -- wore glasses, and wasn't too bad looking-younger looking that I expected, too.
