 I decide I want to strengthen my knee muscles by running stairs in my dormitory, Franklin Hall. So I do. The stairs area all wooden and get narrower as you get towards the top. It's hard to even squeeze through some places because it's so narrow. I get to the top. The building is swaying side to side. I know I'm on the 4th floor and it's swaying the most here. It is not swaying as much on the 3rd floor. The wooden floor is like grandpa and grandma's old upstairs hallway. It's 2:00am, and there are people crashed on the floor because they're drunk. I step over them. There is a head master lady, who is an old Russian woman sitting at a desk. I think she's drunk. I enter a door after I pass the Russian lady. I am in grandma Redding's old plant room. There is a kid there who plays soccer; Kevin Nielson I think, and I think he's drunk too. He tells me he saw me score a goal. I tell him I don't play soccer. We are down by the exit door to the plant room, and we go outside. There is a pack or bunch of wolf-like dogs outside. They start chasing Kevin. I yell at the dogs. They turn toward me and I run. I am ready to kick the dog coming directly towards me when it jumps at me, but it doesn't jump. All the dogs come close and are snarling at me, ready to attack. I wake up, but am not really afraid.
