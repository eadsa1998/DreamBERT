Then in another dream I saw myself disagreeing with my grandmother about the creation of the world. I was trying to make her see that everything the Bible said in Genesis I and Genesis II was simply untrue, but at the same time I was telling her that the only thing one should believe is that there is one God, creator or everything and superior to everybody.
