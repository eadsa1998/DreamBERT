Mom and I were in this boat and it was kind of rocking. And I don't remember too much about that. The next thing I knew I was in school and they were showing this movie about some girl -- I can't remember if it was Celine Dion, Pocahontas or Snow White, but it was kind of a combination of all three of those. And this guy next to me had a cell phone that was beeping, and the teacher told him to turn it off, and then it sounded making a back-up alarm sound and the teacher took it. And then I dreamt that I was in my room and I was listening to the song that was called "The Prayer" with Celine Dion and Andrea Bocelli, except that Celine Dion's voice was like all chipmunky and really, really weird. I was doing something while that was happening, while that was playing, and Dad walked in and he seemed to like the song still anyway, even though her voice was all funny and strange. And then I woke up.
