I was at the airport saying goodbye to a friend from school who was leaving for the U.S.A. I wanted to cry, but at the same time I gave her a lot of advice, and she told me that she would follow it, and that I shouldn't worry. She also told me that she was always going to write. I said goodbye early so that I wouldn't see her leave, and as I went by each door, I stopped to look at what could be inside.
