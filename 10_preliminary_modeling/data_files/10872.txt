I was watching my French teacher (a female of about 50 years) step out of her nightgown. She seemed to have on two because I could not see any of her body when she stepped out of the first one-and they were light green in color. We seemed to be getting ready to go somewhere together. My French teacher looked at me and said that I had better take off my sweater which I was wearing over my dress or I would be too warm. I replied in French "J'ai peu d'avon froid, je vain garden mon chandail," which is translated, "I am afraid I will be cold, I'm going to keep the sweater on." The dream ended there.
