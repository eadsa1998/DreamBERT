I was going to the dentist about my gums.  It turned out to be the oral surgeon who removed my wisdom teeth instead, and I was going to have to go under anesthesia.  He and I sat in a dark room talking.  He said something about going for a bike ride sometime, that he wished we were better friends like he was with my father.  I hugged his arm.  I became my sister, and the person going under for surgery was a boy.  Something went wrong and the doctor and I ran around to the back side of the building.  There were some kids trying to sabotage the surgery.  I don't remember how to we took care of it.  I guess we fought them.  Coming out I swung myself through the loop of a giant letter above the doorway, as it was something I was supposed to have done long before and never did..chicken I guess.  We got down and I was also compelled to cross the street.  I did that too.  During all this though, I wasn't really me, I was watching from the 3rd person.  We went back to the main room to my brother.  He hadn't undergone the surgery but he was coming out of the anesthesia.  The rough boys came back, and I was the one under anesthesia again.  I tried to fight them, weakly, still affected by the drug.  I couldn't get any momentum in hitting them with my elbow but I grabbed his nuts and squeezed.
