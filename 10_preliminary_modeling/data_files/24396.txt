There was this girl from school. She came up to me and said, "I thought you were going to be cool. Well, I'm going to test you. Why don't you come over to my house and see my real saw (tool)?" Wendy was with me. And a lady, who was supposed to be Wendy's mother, said, "Well, you go with her." We had to go up this steep hill, and lots of people were there. I had a long dress on. People were taking pictures of us. And Donald from my class picked me up and hung me over the edge. I said, "Wendy, go tell my mom." But he put me back down. Then the girl from school laughed.
