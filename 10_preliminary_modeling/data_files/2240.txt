Bonnie and I are in a room and there is a rattler snake. I am afraid of it. Bonnie is unconcerned and picks it up by the tail and I cry out in fear that it will bite her. She laughs at me as it wriggles around nearly biting her and then nearly biting me. I move away, fearful and angry at her for putting me in this danger. She thinks I'm being silly.
