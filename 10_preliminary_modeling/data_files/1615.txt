I am visiting Carol and Rob and am in the bathroom brushing my teeth. Rob sneaks in, thinking he is finding Carol. I feel a little embarrassed, like I'd been caught with my pants down. There is no water, so I turn on a faucet. Slimy green gunk comes out of the faucet. I get some on my brush. A child tells me it will make me sick. I enjoy Carol and Rob's company. I think I should buy Sat. dinner, but I don't.
