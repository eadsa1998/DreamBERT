I had asked someone something about our computer work and they didn't tell me the truth. I don't know if it was on purpose or not. It caused me much extra work. I had three huge stacks of patient charts on my desk to do something with as a result. I was trying to find a better way to fix it rather than doing all those charts. I was talking to someone about it.
