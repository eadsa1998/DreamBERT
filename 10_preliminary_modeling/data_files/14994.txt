I was driving with Mom. We were going to the beach but we missed the turn off at first. We turned around and not in the car and Mom rolled a skateboard on the ground and this car ran over it but didn't hit it. Then we were back in the car and they reversed into us. Mom drove forward and pushed them into the car in front of them. We ran off and left her car behind. Later we went back. There were some Asian girls there. These two guys that had been in the car were now blind. We got on a train and it was weird and the seats all faced the middle. I used my SmartRider but it picked up on Mom's address. Darren was there too. The Asian girls gave me some money. Mark (Ugly Betty) was excited that the guy's were blind. I called Mom to tell her and she screamed with excitement and I was like 'ok...'. I went to leave and Mark said "Do you know you want to be with her?", which meant 'do you like your current crush'. I laughed and said "Why did you say her?". He just stared at me and I figured it had something to do with him being gay. Then this kid had this electronic book with information about people from school. You could find your compatibility. I got 30% with someone. I got 100% with Eugene and Dmitri. Tears Run Rings played on the train.
