At the CAS office, though it doesn't look like it does in waking life. It has quite a few more rooms than in waking life. A meeting there. Bill C in his office reading a newspaper. He has it open and holding it up. I can't see him for the paper. I'm talking to him and he eventually lowers the paper and looks at me while we're talking. I notice that he is alone in the office and I wonder if either of the other two men still work for him. There are a lot of people there to work on a project or projects. We divide into teams and I am the team leader for one of the teams. I tell my team we are going to the room at the back of the office because there is lots of stuff there that we can use. This is where all of the books and such are stored. Bryan N comes in and says something to me. I do little more than acknowledge him. I tell my group that the book, BCB, would be especially helpful.
