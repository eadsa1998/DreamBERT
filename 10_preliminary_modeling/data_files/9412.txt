I feel stifled in our apartment and want to transform it. See a round cardboard with tiny hole in the middle. I say "That is all I can see of the outside world!" Shift: I am about to give my baby boy up for adoption so I can be free to educate mothers. I give him to a woman but worried if she knows how to bring him up. Ask if she has read Spock? I am determined that she bring him up well so go out to buy a copy of Spock. Earlier was aghast when she picks him up and he screams.
