This dream takes place in a park very reminiscent of Golden Gate Park in San Francisco. I am scheduled to give a public lecture outdoors, and an older person, the organizer of the lecture series, tells me to get dressed for the event. I walk off to a secluded part of the park near a fountain and proceed to undress. I am quite embarrassed by this, and hope that nobody sees me. (No one does.) When I remove my underwear, it becomes hopelessly tangled with the new pair of underwear, like two links in a chain. Struggling, I manage to put on the new pair as the old pair hangs at my side. I finish dressing and tuck the old underwear under my shirt, hoping nobody will notice it. I walk over to an area of benches where people are waiting for the lecture to begin. I see X. (a female friend) sitting there and walk up to her. "This is going to be a good lecture", I promise her.
