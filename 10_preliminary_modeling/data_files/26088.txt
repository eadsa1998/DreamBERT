 I go into a house and up the stairs. I know this to be the Spanish House at Brimson, with its tall tower-like structure. The stairs are tricky: I have to walk on the side ledge of the stairs, not on the stairs themselves. My roommate Stephen Ramos follows me. A man passes us on the stairs. At the top of the stairs are living quarters. There is an open space between two rooms, with two people living in each room. I'm going to live here. There is a stove, two refrigerators, etc., pretty much everything we'll need to live. Two of the men that I'm going to be living with are there. They are stereotypical "nerds": big and goofy. We're on the very top floor of the house. It's shaky, and will sway when everyone shifts his weight. I'm leery of living here because it's shaky. There is another set up stairs going down in a corner of the second room. When I first walked in on the ground floor, I saw a set of stairs, which may be these.
