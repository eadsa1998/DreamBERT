I was at a shop. There were aisles of different horror things which I was doing for the challenge. I was watching The Sixth Sense in one of them. Dad was there, as was Leif. One of the aisles at the end had a John Lennon section. I went to and they played his music, though they also played Every Breath You Take. Other people came and were moping. Dad and Ezra also came and I took a picture of all the people. I was then playing a game where you get trapped in a room and you have to try to escape. Some were hard and took me a while. One of them was in a bathroom that was only the size of a toilet. The only thing in the room was a mirror with a cabinet and a big water section. I couldn't work it out and freaked out and started crying and screaming. They opened it and let me out. They said that that one and some of the other puzzles had no way out. I was then at home and had two pieces of toast with jam. I put in another for Vegemite. Mom said not to eat the jam ones.
