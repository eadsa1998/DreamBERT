Anne Co from SVH and Lucy from the TV show ER were there. The three of us were working together. We were supposed to be working in this old building full of old furniture. It seemed to be used for storage. They were pretty much letting me set up where I wanted. I put my desk by a window. I think I moved it again. Had to move lots of stuff around. Very dirty, dismal cluttered place.
