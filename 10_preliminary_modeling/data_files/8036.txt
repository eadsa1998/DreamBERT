I was a contestant on a dating show. I was competing with 10-12 other women, ages 16 and 46. I was the 46-year-old. Ben D was there. There were three shower rooms. Two of them each had two showers and the other had just one shower. There were rooms that had just beds. The room was the length of the bed and not much wider. The shower rooms were the same size. Two of the bedrooms each had two beds and one had just one. One room for an employee was a bigger room but not much in it. It did have a shower in there and the door locked. At the top of the door was an open space, kind of like they used to have in old houses/buildings. We each created some kind of artwork on a piece of paper the size of a flipchart. I was being taunted. I violently lost my temper and destroyed someone's artwork. Four finalists were chosen to be contestants for the next year. It was one overnight. Most of the overnight bags, including my own, were the size of a regular handbag. I had to sleep in one of the large living areas as the beds were all taken already. The next day I wanted to take a shower either in the room with only one shower or take my shower in one of the other rooms when no one else was in there. I couldn't manage either one. I then went into the employee room and decided to use that shower. Other people were trying to get in. They didn't think I should be using that room. There was an entry hallway. In the hallway was a bar, like in a clothes closet. All the contestants had their formal gowns hanging there. I was one of the finalists for the next year. I was talking to the other finalists about our gowns for next year. Ben D kind of came to my rescue when the other contestants and some other men were being critical of me, etc. He expressed a romantic interest and told me he was going to take me away so I wouldn't have to worry about any of it.
