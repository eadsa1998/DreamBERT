[1997-06-06] A nightmare more or less I was sleeping and I felt somebody staring at me and I jumped and I sat straight up in bed and thrust my hands out to push away whoever was staring at me but of course there was nobody there. My feet were off the side of the bed. I don't know how to describe the staring sensation, you know how you can just feel it sometimes when someone is staring at you?
