Grandma had a lot of cockroaches. They walked all over the floors. I went into a lighted room and they were even flying around, and I knocked them down with my hands. A small room was filled with them. They had their wings open and were mating. The room was lighted up bright and I could see the cockroaches mating with their wings spread.
