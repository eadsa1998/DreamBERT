I'm in a classroom for adults. It's crowded. I'm sitting in the back, half hidden by other students. The subject is math, my worst subject. Then I look to see if the teacher is there, but she is gone. I move to be closer with the other students. Someone messes my hair. Another teacher, an old man in a suit with wild hair, takes charge of the class. He pesters me. I ask him, "Do you want to get stabbed?" He doesn't hear me, and walks away. The others can't seem to tell if my question was real or a joke.
