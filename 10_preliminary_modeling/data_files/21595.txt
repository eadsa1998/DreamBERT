I was reading apache bellyache will be traveling. That is all I read when I awoke. Carl Fisher and I were surrounded by a gang of gangsters of Mexican bandits and we were getting captured and marched into a big hall. Guns were taken and there was only one way I saw to escape. I started to fly and one of the bandits gave me a shove, which gave me a good start. I flew to close windows and then I flew back to the doors and I escaped. Fisher in the surprise of me also escaped. We were crossing a field where there were cows and one cow started to charge us. We started to run for the fence in flight. Fisher said, "Shoot your gun." I said, "I have no gun," but I put my hand into my pocket and felt a small gun. We got under the wire, then walked over where the bandits were in the big hall. They were inside, afraid of us. We had our two guns. People were going in and out of the hall and they gave us respect.
