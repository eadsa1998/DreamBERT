We were in Russia. A young fellow came there and the Russian Boxing champ was Wallace Berry, our former movie star (deceased). They wanted this fellow to fight Berry, but he heard about six assistants helping him. They would hold him and Wallace would punch him. They finally knocked this fellow down into the water and he was groggy, so Berry challenged him himself. I looked at Berry and he was a big fat bully, very fat. When the man walked out of the water, Wallace punched him and knocked him back into the water. We were looking thru unbreakable glass. The American came near the glass and punched it, breaking it. I could see the cracks in it. Ann and I went into a restaurant. She sat down and I went to see what menu they had. I couldn't see anything, so I asked a waitress what they had. She pointed at the menu signs hanging on some string. One was hanging sideways, so I had to twist my head. I came against the young waitress's breast so I put my head on her bosom and I looked at the menu. It was a Chesapeake steak. My dad was getting a job for himself. He was hired and it was a very hard job at the Chevrolet plant.
