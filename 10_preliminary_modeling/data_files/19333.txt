I was sitting in my room on the phone with one of my friends. Then another friend got on so I was talking to both. Then they got off and immediately I was on the phone with a different friend who I had just begun to talk to again after awhile. Then I heard my mom call me to dinner. I told my friend I had to go so I asked her for her number and I was just about to get it when my alarm woke me up.
