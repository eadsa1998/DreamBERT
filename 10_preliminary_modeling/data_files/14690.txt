It was a movie then it was real. I was at a house near a big window (like the room was just made of windows). A teacher and some kids came past and told me not to worry but there was a hog on the loose and I saw it standing behind them and I said "yeah it's behind you". I ran away from the window and it came to the window. Ezra was then there with me and we locked ourselves in the bedroom and tried to work out how to escape. We called Ms Edmundson because she knew how to get rid of it. Sometimes she was Nana. She got us out and we ran across an oval to get to this huge building which was like a motel/house/thing. It was then Dawson and Joey (both from Dawson's Creek). They got in and they had some sort of supernatural powers. Bad guys wanted to get in and they walked past people waiting for an invitation in. This girl grabbed this guy's hand and went in. Someone sprinkled cinnamon on them to get a spell off. The guy went inside and this other guy made out with an invisible girl. Two guys were also making out. Outside in a forest, Dawson and Pacey (Dawson's Creek) were talking. Pacey and Jen (Dawson's Creek) suggested having sex and Dawson took it as an insult because he couldn't go through with it. Pacey said "I wish I waited" and I wondered if he meant for Joey or Andie. Then I assumed he meant wet dreams and he said they were just kids. Then there was some husband and wife and one of them said "I'm still a virgin".
