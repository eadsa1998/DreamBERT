 I'm on a flight to Australia. My friend Norman Noman is with me. We are not afraid of flying, but I get nervous when the plane turns. We fly into a city, and fly through a tunnel. I see my friend Matt Yams. I walk down a hallway with my friends Terry Foss and Jill Banks. I am in a big room. A conference is taking place in the room. A group of women are singing at the conference. One woman has thick facial hair, with side burns.
