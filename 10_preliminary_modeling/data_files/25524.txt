 There are three big cargo ships. One ship goes off around a little island and heads out to sea. Another ship goes between the island and the shore. Two of the ships dock next to each other in the port area. I'm having a party at my house one night. I get ready, but seem to not care about preparation. There was a crime I am helping police solve. A phone rings and my mom answers it. I tell her to tell the caller I'll be there with the information to help the case. There caller is a police officer, I think. The crime and police officers remind me of the movie Fargo. I climb a wire fence with my big snow boots on. I have two rings on: one with a black gemstone and one with a red gemstone, which may be a ruby, my birthstone. The black gem ring is from mom. As I climb the fence the black ring falls off. I climb over and find it stuck in a wall, with the gem side facing out of the wall. There is something about the number 85. It may indicate a percent or degrees, after I climb the fence. There is an oven there that is getting really hot. It is "five to eight" (that is, 7:55pm). My mom and my sister Ramona are going out for dinner. The oven is red hot. I was going to cook egg rolls at 500 degrees Fahrenheit. Without jumping, I grab a black handle stuck on the ceiling and pull it down.
