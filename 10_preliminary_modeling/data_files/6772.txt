Some sort of language writing contest to be given over television. Br. Krauss at the head of the table, two contestants at either side. Girl at his right in a white sari. Boy next to her is busy writing in Chinese or Japanese characters before the program starts. I ask him why. The two contestants on the left seem to use other languages.
