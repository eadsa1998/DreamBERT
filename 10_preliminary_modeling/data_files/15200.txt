I was at this place like a shop but then it was like a house. There were lots of people over and we were having a party. First I was in a car with Dad and we pulled into this place. This guy came to my window (the car was US style, so I was on the right) and said hello and flirted with me. We started to drive off, but felt compelled to stay and Dad turned around. Everyone got drunk. Ezra was there too. He had a job in 'engineering'. We yelled at someone to leave and then called him to come back? Anyway, it was fun. A few guys there were friendly to me and I knew them, sort of. I was then driving with Mom and she was driving crazy and ended up hitting cars. Then we had 'ducks' that had the last name 'Sparrow' which was like ours. But I was saying to people that they had changed them to something else, but some were still Sparrow and I eventually said 'no last names'. One was called Andrew and someone was like 'that's a girl's name' and I said 'How is Andrew a girl's name?' and they said it was because of the 'Drew' and I said "That's like saying Rik's a girl's name because of the 'i',". Everyone thought it was hilarious and they were all laughing. This guy and I got close to having sex at one point, but we didn't.
