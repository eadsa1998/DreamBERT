We are living in a small house at the Retreat Center: it is very crowded and there are many stairs going up and down; I have a double bed downstairs; Margaret comes to borrow an extra pillow; but after a while I cannot find an extra pillow, and I can't find anything to bring to Margaret; so I gather up a brown bag of scrap materials from some sewing and take it upstairs to her; I have to climb a STEEP WOODEN LADDER to get to her place; I am somewhat embarrassed, because I am not properly dressed
