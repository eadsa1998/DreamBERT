I am visiting the high school in the town next to where I grew up. I am with a Helen, a high school friend. As I am about to leave, I stop at the office and learn that Jane Smith has been wanting to meet me. Jane is the daughter of a local physician I know. She wants me to write a story about a home economics project about baking cookies for a Christmas tree. I do the story but make a big mess. The next night I come back to clean it. It get it all cleaned up and get home and then remember I left the cookies on the teachers desk.
