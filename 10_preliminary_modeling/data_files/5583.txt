[1997-05-30] We were in a house, I don't know whose it was, my sister was getting some ice-cream together and strawberries, but instead of putting them together we had them separately. There were strawberries in a dish and instead of using a spoon, I had picked up the dish and was drinking the strawberries out of the dish and I was going to get to the ice cream later after the strawberries. I could feel the little bowls that they were in and just before I began to eat the strawberries, I put an object, it was a soft, stuffed animal type thing but it was a person, made of this canvasy type material representing Saint Paul. So somehow I had to put this thing, like a stuffed animal, next to me and someone said "that's Saint John" and I said "No that's Saint Paul" . It had a great big base so I knew it wasn't going to fall over or get into my ice cream or strawberries.
