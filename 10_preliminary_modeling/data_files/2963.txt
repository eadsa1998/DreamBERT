Mirabelle and I are in a church and we start clapping our hands to get the congregation to keep time with us. Then we start singing. It went something like this, "Lord I need your help now," and He said, "Just pray to me." I said, "I can do that Lord, I can do that, because I have God, and God has me." Then we'd sing another verse and repeat the chorus. The audience would clap with us at first and then quiet up to hear the words of the verse.
