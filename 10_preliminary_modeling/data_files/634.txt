I am in my grandmother's house. I have been exercising and get a bad pain in my right arm and it moves to the left arm and across the bottom of my chest. My sons are gone. I don't know where they are but think they are at a nearby lake. I get the impression they are in a pickup and the truck is grey but I don't actually see it. I need to get to the hospital and have no car. I go to my Aunt Sarah's house next door and Roger, my cousin, is there. He says he can't help. I decide to walk across the field to the hospital but the pain is getting worse and I am afraid I won't make it. I wake up in pain, but it is not as bad as it was in the dream. I did not know I was dreaming
