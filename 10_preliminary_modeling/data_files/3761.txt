I am making art things. My "dad" comes along and looks at it and says "Hey, that's all I get, a silly necklace around my neck and this?" He's referring to the picture I drew to represent my feelings for him. He's in blue and pink and some kind of neck band thing, holding another picture. I am hurt and say to him, "You are insulting me and my art." I walk away from him, feeling sad. I look again at the picture. I had good reason to draw it this way. I stand by my artistic decisions.
