Girl in the Starbucks/bar who I keep making eye contact with. She's gorgeous, caring, nice ... her dad is mean, doesn't want me anywhere near her. We go on a road trip somewhere. We sit together. I make Bruce (a half-brother, age 2) cry. She has straight dark brown hair, a long angelic face, and warm eyes. She's obviously hot, and everyone looks at her that way. And wants her, but think they can't have her. I see her eyes, and they tell me a lot. We are going somewhere, and she comes with me against her father's wishes.
