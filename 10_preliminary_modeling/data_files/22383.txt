I go into a nightclub (which is near my house) with a group of friends. The clothing of my friends is strange, almost asexual, hippie style (necklaces, long and wide slacks, hats). Going through the door, the d√©cor changes (the dream is in color); we are in a big theatre. We look for a place, because there are a lot of us. A couple of sweethearts are in our way. D. and A. pick a fight. The boy gets up; then I get in and kick his hand, in which there is a lighter. He's gotten scared, my friends stop me. The boy picks up his lighter and asks me how old I am. I ask him why and he tells me so that he will know which of his younger brothers to send to me because I am such a kid.
