I'm leaving to go to work in the morning. It looks like the house in New Brunswick, and I'm looking at all the cars parked up and down both sides of the street and thinking to myself that this is all the metal and glass that we could stand, I guess. Then I'm thinking of when I come back from work, of parking. Now I think this is in my mind's eye, but it's quite a distinct, a very distinct part of the dream. I picture an ordinary size automobile. It's more like a Volkswagen bus. I picture one of those with a little Volkswagen or Renault inside of it. The idea here is to save time. This way when you come home from work, you can just hop right in the other car, roll it down and out the back, dash off, and then drive the car back up into the Volkswagen bus when you come back. This way you save on parking spaces, needing only one.
