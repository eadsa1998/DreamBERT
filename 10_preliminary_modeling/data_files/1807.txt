One detail I left out of my dream last night I didn't even write in my dream journal, it seemed so silly and I couldn't see that it meant anything. It was a blue advertisement card with white lettering on it, and it was in a drunk man's mouth as he told me he loved me. So as I was eating breakfast, I was thinking about that card and describing it in my mind, "Blue with white lettering" and I look up to the fruit baskets hanging above the toaster and see a blue card with white lettering. I read the words. They are: "Nobody takes care of you better than you." "Ha!" says I, startled. The cosmos does it again. What an interesting series of internal events to get me to notice what is in front of my face every morning!
