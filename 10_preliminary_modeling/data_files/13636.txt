I was at school, I think. I had this room there. I went in and Darius followed me, so I closed the door and pushed him out. He kept trying to come in. Later, Eugene and others and also Clayton, were coming out of class. All these people came to my room. Silas and Calvin were there. Darius came again and I was thinking of Evelyn. There was music on TV. Electric Avenue was on but I thought it was It's My Life at first. There was also a song by Kevin Connolly but he was called Eric. Everyone loved his song. I was then in class and we were reading out some essay with a spelling mistake. I called the person sitting next to me a retard. It was my essay and I showed the teacher that it wasn't a spelling mistake but a typing error. Dad wasn't allowed to watch 24 because of the error. I was then somehow with these two people who had been handcuffed together. One of them was Jack (24), and he was rogue. They were both good guys though. This plane flew over and I thought they were going to crash into the building. We ran from this car and I stopped thinking that I would get in trouble. The 'police' and Aaron (24) came. Then they went to Christopher Walken's place and asked something and he had changed his name because of Jack (not sure why). Christopher thought that the police were there because of something he had done and refused to talk. Jack was hiding over the fence. I had a puppy. It was really cute and it had big feet. It was black.
