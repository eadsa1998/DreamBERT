I am at a gas station and a bad guy, "Charlie Brown", is coming to do mischief. I get up on the roof of the gas station in order to defend. When Charlie Brown arrives, I have the element of surprise. I jump down and somehow get him to a position where he is lying on the ground helpless. I have a rifle with me and I fire it in his general direction, apparently not actually harming him. He is shocked that I would shoot at a defenseless man and he tells me, "I wouldn't shoot if you were lying here."
