I was suppose to meet William at the state park. The state park had 8 underground park levels connected by elevators and steps. I didn't know which level I was suppose to meet him at. He had called on the phone to say that he WAS in the park. There was a vendor with a hot dog stand under an umbrella, selling popcorn only. I tasted it and it was very greasy and salty. I decided not to bring popcorn for the class picnic. Then I thought I might be in the wrong park so I went on the highway. (I was driving a car) I was suppose to take EXIT 7 but I missed it and I got off at EXIT 8. There was no state park in sight. There were wall-to-wall buildings. Tall and crammed together. There were flashy billboards all over the sides. Overpasses crossed over the highway everywhere. I knew I had to get back to EXIT 7 which HAD been the right place, but I wasn't looking forward to driving in the middle of all that crazy speeding traffic, red lights, buildings suffocating each other, loud tacky signs--general chaos.
