I went back home for a bit. It was hot and humid. The air-con wasn't really working. The cold air-con was the only thing helping. Home was different. Mom, Darren and Ezra were there. I said I'd have to stay in lounge and have a 'movie marathon' to keep cool. I decided to play games instead. I was telling Mom I'd have to go back soon because I couldn't handle the weather. Also there was a movie which kept changing to real life, where some weird stuff had happened and this lady was saying a spell calling 'Cloverfield' and then it showed this bridge and a giant foot step on it and start walking that way. We were going the other way through a tunnel. Clovie got there and it was actually a dinosaur and big, but not as big as Clovie. Then I was actually there and it roared at us and we ran and hid, but it found us and we continued running. Then I was at this house. A person gave me a key and said it was for the door in the kitchen -- there was a trapdoor in the ceiling. A clone of this girl was there. There was something to do with Lost.
