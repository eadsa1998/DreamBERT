A woman is dressed in a white dance leotard and is dancing on a black and white set. I am intrigued with the shadows on her face and body as she danced through dark and light. I try to explain to her that I know this is her dance, but I see it from a different perspective because she can't see the shadows she is dancing with. I think it is beautiful. She doesn't understand me and is annoyed that I try to impose my vision on her dance. I move on and see other performers. Reynold and I critique them and write our remarks on scraps of paper. I realize that they are good remarks and should be kept for inclusion in a book. I start to sign his with the name Kevin Tom (sort of a title like a high monk would have) and my name was to be Beneficent B, but that was too long to keep writing so I decided on Benign B. I start gathering up the papers to compile. Reynold comes in and asks me if I know of any good places to stay at in B Town. He's going to a conference. I think and come up with two or three. The first is a place near the University that used to be a fraternity or sorority and now is made into a bed and breakfast. You have to share a room with someone or you can get a single room for a bit more money. Reynold doesn't like the idea of a roommate. I tell him the rooms are lovely, carpeted and nice furniture, even though the beds are bunk beds and it is a dormitory style setup. Then I mention a hotel near town that is like the E City Hilton. I can't remember the names of either one and tell him I'll go look them up and tell him later.
