My dream of last night is in two parts. In the first part, I am in the Barranco Marina, two blocks away from home. I am looking at the sunset, which is slowly taking place, when, to my surprise, I see sharks which are waiting for someone to fall into the sea. Then I see a male classmate of mine coming close, and he suddenly falls into the void where the sharks are, but immediately he climbs onto the marina and is saved. Among the rocks my clothes are getting dry and when I try to grab an item, I fall into the sea, but the water only hits me at the middle of the knee. Then I see the lifesaver playing around with a sheep dog as though nothing were bothering him or calling his attention, and this, naturally, astonishes me. When I see this scene, I try to reach to the top, and make it, after making a great effort. In the second part, the surroundings are an ordinary country house. In order to reach it, it's necessary to go through a water ditch and cross a narrow passage. There are several of us in this dream. I can distinguish a lady who is a widow now, and who hints about her daughter. Going on with the story, she asks me to accompany to her house, to please go with her, since her daughter is there and I might as well visit her. We get on the road (I go with her out of courtesy), which looks like a hideout place for thieves. When we get to the ditch, we find that the bridge is in such shape that the wood holding it up seems to be rotting. I get to cross it by jumping, and then I awake.
