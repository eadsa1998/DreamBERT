["Finding the incest perpetrator."] A family has brought me the information or their story about an incest situation. I reconstruct the story and present it. I tell the audience that the incest part is my interpretation, not what the family brought me. I now hide in a closet waiting. The man who I suspect is the perpetrator comes in and begins to talk, a sort of confession. One of the family members locks something and he hears the lock shutting. He stops talking before he has incriminated himself. He knows now I am after him. I might be in danger. Now there is several contraptions, one a sort of hydraulic lift made of a white porcelain like material. The other is like a small bathtub. It has a leak in it from a hole in the bottom. The lift isn't working right. The tub is damaged. I might be in danger.
