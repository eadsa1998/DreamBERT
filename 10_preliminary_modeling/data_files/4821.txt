["Paulina mad at me."] I am in a bed, in some public building. Maybe an apartment. I have a sack with Paulina's birthday present in it, two of them in fact. I hide them behind my back with the pillows. I call to Paulina to come see her Birthday present. She is angry at me and doesn't listen to what I'm saying. She comes in the window and complains about what I've done that she doesn't like. Finally I get defensive and angry and say she can't have her present. She says she doesn't care. It is unpleasant.
