The dream at first occurred in the north country. It was cold and bleak. Great mounds of snow were stretching before me. I looked in the direction of my Ford auto and was startled and frightened at the pack of burly vicious wolves which were running towards it. I ran towards the car with a great burst of speed, opened the door and went in. I felt greatly relieved, however, when I looked in the back seat. My recently married long time friend was necking with his wife which made me feel left out. I stepped on the gas and started, then I spotted a big dog come lumbering towards the car. I tromped down on the accelerator and got out of there. The following transition was amazing. I found myself driving down a long white-paved highway which was abounding on each side with lush green vegetation, and to the right of me was a lake which was teeming with wild ducks. The sight was wonderful after the first experience I had been through.
