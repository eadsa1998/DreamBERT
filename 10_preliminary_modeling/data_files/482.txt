I am walking on a shore trying to get someplace. There are a lot of obstacles and I am trying to call someone on the phone as I go but he (I know it is a man) won't answer. My feet are wet. I almost fall in the water. I get back and there is no answer but I know he is there. I decide to try again. I am thinking about seeing a counsellor (a woman) next time I go to the beach. There is a lot of mud in the water. There is also a wooden structure and some stuff like sawdust and I am saying "I need an answer now."
