I am taking swim lessons and we are lined up at the edge of the pool and kicking our feet and legs. It is very easy and I am surprised. I look up and see an older man, the coach, come into the room and I feel shame and try to move away so he won't see me. He almost recognizes me, staring after me. He asks someone about the married couple. I guess there was some scandal and I was involved. As I'm swimming, I notice a tiny woman is in my arms like about 5" tall. We are going to swim together. She sees a line and wants to join it but I say that's the line for people trying to get in, but we're all ready in. We walk around to another side of the pool and I lie on my back and do the back stroke as she lies on my belly. I am very careful not to spill her off me or let the water wash her overboard. I swim three or four strokes to the deep end, turn and do the same number of strokes to the middle part. Back and forth we swim. Now she's a child and I am writing letters on her wet suit for her. It spells "Doctor Day..." Her father comes in and she says, "How do the letters look?" He says cheerfully, "Good, but, dear, the T is a little crooked." I say, annoyed with him for being critical and not just supporting the little girl's happy feelings of wanting to impress him, "I wrote those letters." He is embarrassed. The letters are upside down because I'd been standing at the head end of the suit when I wrote them. Now I am sewing a zipper pouch to the suit. The mother says, "How nice." She's learning how to manage the zipper now.
