I went (to) a Chinese place. We were at the library in San Francisco. I went to a CD store, also in San Francisco. I bought three CDs and went (to) a shirt place to see if they sell shirts that were cheap. The time had run out. There was something going on with the Chinese people. (Illegible - numbers?) I had bought my CD for Clarissa, my friend. Setting: San Francisco, CD store, shirt store. Characters: Chinese people - I'm just beginning to be friends with them. Clarissa from Clarissa Explains it All. Feelings and Thoughts: Fun. I was buying stuff for my best friend Amy - that was fun.
