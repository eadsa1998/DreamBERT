I am an active participant in a military-style insurrection at a large commercial airport. Several of us operate out of our command post on the third floor of the control tower building. At first we hope that nobody has found out, but then some of my fellow rebels go out to the runway and announce to the pilot of a plane about to take-off, "Do you know that we have taken over?"
