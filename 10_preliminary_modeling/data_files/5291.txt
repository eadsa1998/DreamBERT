I dreamed that James Bond lived in my basement and was having a huge party. There were 6 bars, strippers, gamblers, kegs, and lots of music and everything. I went down there and people were playing card games. But the people weren't real. I guess I just asked why the people weren't real. Someone told me that James Bond was impersonal. So the fake people represented the superficiality of them. I went back upstairs. Then I was trying to watch a movie, but my brother and Wyatt were shooting hockey pucks all over the place and I couldn't do whatever it was I wanted to do. I was really frustrated. Granddaddy was making cereal for a present for me.
