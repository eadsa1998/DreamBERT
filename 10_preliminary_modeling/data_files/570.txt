Laura, a woman I work with, and I are walking by a lake in my hometown. I find two snake skins and some other part of the snake which I can't remember. Then we see the snake itself. It is huge and looks like the Loch Ness Monster. An old lady comes out into the yard and I think we should warn her about the snake because it might eat a child or a pet. She has no concerns about it. I go into her house for some reason and then come out. Laura has gone down the road and is talking with a man. Then the snake starts coming my way. I am frightened in the dream and in actuality I have sleep paralysis. I call for help and my husband wakes me up.
