Father Andrew and I are coming out of a Church; I wait for a ride; see Father in old blue car; run to hop a ride; he is very nice; he shows me a piece of verse. He asks me to translate it from the Greek. - Then we go into a Methodist or Episcopal Church, to look it over. We have to stand outside in the rain. I remember wiping off the rain from his face and neck, very gently. - Then I see an analyst: he asks me why I am so self-oriented. I have trouble answering.
