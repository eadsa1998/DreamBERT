["Lazy PA."] I am on a motorcycle wearing black leather jacket and a white scarf around my neck. I am driving on a mountain road. Suddenly a man in a car comes around me and stops, blocking the lane of traffic. He's out to get me. I turn and drive up a steep gravel road to Ginny's "house." I try to drive in but finally get off the motorcycle and walk in, locking the doors. The scene shifts. I am walking down a city street. I want to take a bath, even though it isn't scheduled until tomorrow. I tell my PA to prepare the special stretcher, bathtub we have. She is annoyed and wants to wait until tomorrow. I insist. I lie down, on the stretcher which has a special head rest for the shampooing. It feels comfortable, even though I am outside on the sidewalk. I believe I am clothed as well. Again, the scene shifts and I am in my van as a passenger. My PA stops in traffic in the turning lane and lets me out. I am annoyed she is blocking traffic. I am standing. She says she'll bring my wheelchair but she wants to use it too, She's tired. I am confused and a bit upset with her. She parks the van up the road and brings a manual wheelchair. Now I am walking down the sidewalk with another woman. I see a store window display of many large tropical fish, all flat and orange gold color with one large round black spot on it. Someone picks one up and bites off its tail. I feel queasy. They bite into the body and I can't look any more. My friend sees a display of round pendants on the sidewalk for sale. She lies down on the sidewalk to see them better. I bend over and look too.
