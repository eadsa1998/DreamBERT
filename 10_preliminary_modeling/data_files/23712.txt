I am in the R&amp;B band again.  [I was in this band, Rhythm Box, during my college days at UCSC.]  John M and Billie Jean are there.  But we are either near Moab, Utah or Edgewood, Texas.  It's rural.  We ride horses to the gig.  Cody is there.  [He was my horse during junior high and high school years.]  We're setting up for the show and I realize I forgot to bring any performing clothes or anything.  I just rode up there with the band members.  I have 40 minutes before show.  I ask John if I can go back to "Tucson" and he looks doubtful I'll make it in time.  I go to Cody and see that he's tied up okay.  I untie him to work with the rope, to tie it better.  He lays down.  I rub his stomach, head, neck, he loves it.  I'm really taking care of him and enjoying it.  I want to give him a longer lead so he can lay down during the show.  I go in a garage and know I will find long-nosed pliers which I need to cut off rope and fix his fastener.  I do.  I fix up his lead, he's laying sometimes, standing up sometimes, he's very loving to me, appreciative.
