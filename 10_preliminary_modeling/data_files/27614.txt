I went down to a photographers to have my graduation picture taken. While I was waiting there, I noticed the different pictures placed around in the studio. One in particular I stared at--it was of a young man very poorly dressed. He had what was probably his best Sunday suit on, but it was obviously very inexpensive suit. There were the usual number of glamour portraits of young women. I decided I wanted that type of portrait.
