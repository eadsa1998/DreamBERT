I am Paul Newman's dresser. I'm in charge of choosing his matching outfits. He picks some pants and I find matching or coordinated shirts, etc. I tell him I love the movie star Paul Newman and have dreamt about him and then realize he is the same person. I feel a bit embarrassed. He chooses a gray pair of pants and I am upset because I can't find anything to match or go with it. I have failed and I shrug and say, "Oh well, you'll just have to figure it out yourself then."
