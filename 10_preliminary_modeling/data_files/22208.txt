When I dreamed this, I was only half-asleep. I was in a classroom, but I didn't know any of the other students; they all wore uniforms. The professor was a priest, so I think it must have been theology, but I had never seen him before. The teacher called me and told me that I had thrown a pen he had given me in the waste can and later he told me to go and pick it up again. I don't understand this dream.
