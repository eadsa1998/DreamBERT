My roommate and I lived together in an old one-roomed house. The house was very comfortable, though, inside. The area at this place was very remote as far as neighbors were concerned, but there are trees and streams there. Our house was located where an old dynamite shed is located (in the real setting). I was a little provoked at my roommate's messy habits of leaving everything lying around in a chaotic manner. Despite this I was happy to remain there. Finally my roommate decided to leave because it was so desolate. I should have been sorry to see him go, but I felt glad to be left alone in this small house. I remember that it was hard to get to and from this place, because of a marshy area that had to be crossed. After my roommate left, I took life easy and actually was very happy loafing. Then people began to come back to see me, children mostly. They wanted to see how I was. I felt that I was obliged to entertain these people's curious desire to see me and even was glad when they came, but I began to feel as though I was separating from society, turning into an oddity.
