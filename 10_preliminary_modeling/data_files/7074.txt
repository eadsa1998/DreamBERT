At a psychological meeting, am appointed with one woman to nominate the president. We were lying under a low roof to discuss it I was hoping she'd suggest me. Then my cousin E. K. Strong came out and I wanted to name him. She said he was cold but then he smiled and greeted us. (Woke and dreamed again). ... Going some place when remembered we must report on the nomination.
