[1997-06-27] I was in a great big store. But it wasn't a department store it was filled with music boxes. Small ones that played little tunes, and the ones I've always wanted to listen to and maybe buy, the big antique music boxes that had these disks that you could play and have several different tunes on them. I was just listening to those music boxes letting the music kind of surround me and hear the different sounds, the bell-like sounds, the different kinds of music box sounds you can hear... and not only did this shop have music boxes, but it also had all kinds of great things that had music inside them. They had musical clocks, it had a music clock that had a talking announcement before the time of alarm in the morning. It talked so that I could set the alarm myself. They had a radio which gave you the choice of regular music and music box music. There were just all kinds of music boxes there. I reached into my purse because I decided that I wanted to buy some of the music boxes and nothing was inside there, no money and no credit cards to pay for them. I woke up feeling kind of ridiculous.
