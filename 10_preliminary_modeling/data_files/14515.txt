Ezra and I drove off from Mom. We went to the shop and Ezra wouldn't let me drive. Later, I was somewhere in Brookland. I went to a bus stop and waited. I saw this Native lady, who I recognized, and she told me to go to the other side, which I was going to anyway. She said to say hello to Mom and I asked her what her name was and she said 'Ateena'. The map on the bus stop was hard to understand. The bus came and I asked the driver "Miss?", but it was a guy and I asked if the bus went to Princess Rd and he said it did. We drove around the other side of this rollercoaster, which was abandoned, and then went down all these random side streets. I was confused so I got off at a weird place. I text Mom to get me. George Bluth (Arrested Development) was on a walk and I said "what about Lucille?" but she was there too. I had no shoes and so I couldn't walk back home.
