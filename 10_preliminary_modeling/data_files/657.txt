I am working at the emergency room in the hospital and someone asks me to work Saturday for his wife. I say I can't because I have to take a picture for the paper. He says he thought I was off and I say I thought so to. Just then a young child spills something and is burned on his face. I tell the male nurse to get the cold water and someone in the background says, "cold water? That's not new. It causes TB." I say my skills have deteriorated and the nurse keeps buttering me up, especially in front of my husband, as though I am a hero even though I said to do the wrong thing. I say you just want me to work Saturday. I'm thinking now that I've done with my dissertation I should work one day a week at the hospital.
