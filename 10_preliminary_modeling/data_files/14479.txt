I discovered some bombs, I think. I pushed them away and closed a gate. Some kids, others and I lied down and covered ourselves and it went off. Then it was a desert place. There were a few houses and a few things in the sand to stay in. There weren't many people left, no electricity etc. I was trying to work out with someone what we were going to do with everyone. There weren't many male children, and they were mostly black. I can't remember what happened but this girl and I were in an airplane thing and the guy started to take off. The girl was Judy Reyes sometimes. I peeked over the top and he was going to commit suicide by flying into the mountains. He stopped to take a break. We got out and we ended up in a carpark. We ran behind a building and took a car. We saw his car coming back (it was a red sporty looking car). We drove at full speed away from him. I was then running and was in a building at Westland. I was going up and down stairs and ended up in the library and I didn't know where to go.
