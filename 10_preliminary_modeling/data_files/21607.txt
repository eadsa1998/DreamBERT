We were watching two crows flying around quite close, but it was in the city limits and we couldn't shoot them. We were in a cafe and two Negro boys were dancing. One had a dance where he rolled on the floor. Ann and I danced and when we came close to the end of a fancy dance, I fell down on my knees. I lost my balance. We brought two chairs for my brother Steve and me and one was a rocker. I was looking at some green vegetable. It was supposed to be a manufactured product that was done for Harwood Hilts.
