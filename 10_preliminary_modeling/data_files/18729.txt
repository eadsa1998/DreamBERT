There was a snake. It was a constrictor but it had fangs too. It was striped like a coral snake and it lived in a tree mostly but it got brave and started venturing into the world. When I looked up to the tree limb where it lived and the snake wasn't there. ??? I couldn't see the snake. It could be anywhere. First id did not stray far--different levels of the tree house--but then it got into the swimming pool ???. Just when I got to the 3rd--little tiny child, child, the snake was stretching his fangs around the baby's wrist. I grabbed the baby just in time and lifted her out of the pool. The children had not even noticed the snake. We opened the doors. On the ??? I was cooking vegetable soup. First I had no pot. I was cooking in a big gallon zip-lock plastic bags. I started cutting an onion and William was scraping carrots.
