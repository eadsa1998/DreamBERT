 I'm hunting on private land in the Big Resort Area. There are cabins and a road there. My neighbor Alvin Broud and his children drive by on the road. I know they have a cabin, but I didn't know it was up here. I walk back. It seems I am walking from my alley (which may be the road) around the south side of the house. I walk by windows. Ricky and Alan Broud see me. I wave. They look like they think I shouldn't be there. There is a huge tree with a thick trunk. The trunk is cut or worn in a way so the tree is leaning. I think the tree is in Broud's yard. I tell Alvin he has a leaning tree on his property, though it may be on our property, I realize. I see a photograph of my mom when she was younger. She had light, blondish hair: no gray hair. She is with her friend Kate Dancer in the photograph. My mom tells me that Sarah Broud died yesterday. Alvin is there and we're in the kitchen. There is no break in the conversation, as if no one is sad that Sarah has died. I know they are sad, but I'm not, so I don't react. I'm eating sweet corn with barbeque sauce on it. Some of the kernels are really hard. Alvin and my mom talk and tell me about airplane discounts, and say that people get credit for flying now, like a free flight with one paid or a free $50 food certificate (which may be for use on the plane). I take care of Ricky and Alan at their house. They eat sliced cheese.
