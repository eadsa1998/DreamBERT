 I'm driving a motorcycle. My sister Heather is on back of the motorcycle. We pass another man on a motorcycle. We are in Oak Valley, and it is nighttime. I turn in to the Railroad Company lot where my old Boy Scout building used to be. The other guy turns into the lot too. I can see his headlights behind me. I park the motorcycle. The man pulls up next to me. It's my friend Bubba Hacker. He needs to get something from the building: a clip or a scarf or another small item. He knocks on the door. I am about to just walk inside when he tells me there are people inside. A woman opens the door. I tell her what we're doing. She lets us in and goes to try to find the item, which Bubba left a long time ago. There are people in the building. They are building crafts: tops, pictures, and paintings. Natural settings are used. The items are like those that one might find in a gift shop in the north woods.
