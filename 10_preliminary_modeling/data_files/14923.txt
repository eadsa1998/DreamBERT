We had those little puppies we looked at. They were "under 34 days" old, so we put them near a cat. They sucked on it but nothing came out and then we realized it was a cat. Mom, Ezra and I went somewhere that was like a Timezone and it had games outside (inside the shop, but outside the Timezone). It was night. There were heaps of people were at the games outside but inside it was really quiet. They were setting up a ride. It had a long seat. People got on, including a guy with a dog. It had no railing, and it went up and then he was like 'oh maybe I should've put the dog down', then it fell off his lap onto the mat, but it was ok. We went on and it weighed us, using a thing which put two bags on top of each other. My first one was full and a tiny bit of the second, Mom's first one wasn't full and Ezra's was less than mine. I covered up mine. We were at a shop later with Mom and Darren. He had this red and black umbrella/raincoat thing and it was spiffy.
