We needed to make a big circular hook rug. Somebody had thought, "The underside weaving of carpet would LOOK good," but then the rug fibers flew all over the place. The rug was 6^X2. 2(6^). [mathematical formulas for flowers] There were 3 colors in the hook rug and dismembered carpet. Dusky blue, faded red and age-yellowed white. Handfuls were causing the disassembly of the carpet fibers falling out. I was trying to delegate hook rug game distractions for anybody working. A guy in prison, Tony, was cutting a hit record. The song was about his love affair. It was called, "Death Row Marriage." He got nervous close to the microphone. I forgot his wife's name, but she was pretty. He was handsome. It was all sad, but then he shouldn't have killed those people in the first place. A drag queen was all excited about permanent spray on hair. She (he?) grabbed the prison singer's butt.
