 I'm scuba diving alone. Ice covers the surface of the water. I slide through a small hole on my mission. I sink down into the dark and realize I forgot the light. I swim back up to the hole and remove the hole cover to get a light. But no one gives me a light. I create a light in my hand. I make it through a chicken coop-like area. I can't breath well at first, but this gets easier. I think of how hard it would be to share a mouthpiece underwater. I see the key that is my goal to obtain. Cautiously I move the key towards me: I don't want to just walk in the room where the key hangs. I get the key and run! My friends Nate Nelling, Tom Napper, Emily Zates, and others are there. We run in a chicken coop-like area. The floor is dust, dirt, cobs and chips. The ceiling is very low. There are pool tables in this subterranean-like area. We move quickly. The ceiling becomes lower: we crawl. We get to an "out" door for August. I've gone too far: I was supposed to exit at July. I exit here. I follow Nate out, squeezing through a small square space. As I emerge a woman is there. We're in a workplace area. She asks and I tell her about my disability: I have come back just to look, not to work. My mom and my brother Wally are there. We're going to leave. I pack up my dirty laundry. There is a woman with colored stamp pads. I put on my Redson basketball shirt and my red checkered shorts. I turn my shorts around, because they're on backwards. My grade school principal, Candy Bevner, sees this.
