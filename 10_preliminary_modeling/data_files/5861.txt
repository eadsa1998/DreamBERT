Am on a 'round the world trip and visiting Australia, where a busload of us have stopped to play baseball. I am last in line to bat and when my turn comes, I suddenly note the bus has gone. Looked for some familiar faces, but only found the stewardess. I was furious at being left behind. Later am in a hotel and same girl (a stranger) is there and I ask her when next plane is due since mine had left and could I continue the tour on next plane. Am dissatisfied with answer and I tell her I am so disgusted I want to go back home. The hotel is big, but seems very junky. I walk around the grounds to kill time and see a guy wearing a sleeveless tunic and a floppy hat. Later see some guy in a hotel room (different man, both strangers) and I ask him where I can get a tunic. He replies that it is made of sheep, like the one he is wearing, which is slightly different, but has long strands of hair. We walk into another room and then I am in my own room and see in mirror that I am wearing earrings. Am astonished and then realize the guy probably saw them but said nothing. Room is very disorderly and I decide to write a nasty letter about this to Pan Am. I go to an office of my company and ask everyone for some paper. No one has any. One offers me a tiny slip of paper. Every piece I pick up from a desk has something printed on one side. I am thoroughly disgusted and storm out to another building looking for the head office where am sure there will be paper for the letter. I find a paper store in the street and also realize at the same time that all I have with me is US money. The thought also strikes me that I was stupid not to have asked for paper at the hotel where there would surely be some.
