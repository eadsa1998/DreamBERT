I was in some complex of buildings similar to the complex at the university where I work.  I could fly, and I was using this ability in a very mischievous manner, to get back at various people for some kinds of injustices or misdeeds, I don't remember exactly how.  I flew up by the window of the room where Julia Douglas was teaching a class, just for the fun of tormenting her, seeing her run to the window in amazement and alarm, etc.  Once I think I stepped off a third floor fire escape in view of a small group of people inside, just to shock them-and then flew before hitting the ground.  At one point, Bill Clay came out of the building into the courtyard and several people rushed up to him to tell him about my shenanigans.  I became quite concerned then that I would get into serious trouble if Bill believed them.  On the other hand, I was confident enough that Bill was too rational to believe I could fly, that I was almost cocky, to make the tattlers look foolish.  I suggested maybe I had put everyone under mass hypnosis.  Bill threw me a curve by not totally rejecting their story as ridiculous, while not accepting the fact that I had flown either.  Somehow he was able to reconcile the substance of the accusations.
