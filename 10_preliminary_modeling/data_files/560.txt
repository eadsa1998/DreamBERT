I am in a clothes store with my daughter (who is a child in the dream) and we are going to lunch. I have to go back to a store to look for a glove I lost. An ambulance drives by as I walk down the hill. The store is a mess, like a kids clothing store I worked in when I was just out of high school. Too much stuff, all over the place, and I can't find the glove. I find a woman's body but no one seems upset. It is as if she has always been there. I try to buy clothes for my daughter but can't find anything amongst all this stuff.
