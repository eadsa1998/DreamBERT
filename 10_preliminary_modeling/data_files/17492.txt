I was watching a lady in a skimpy outfit and wheelchair directing a play, with other skimpily clad girls.  In a different scene they were younger, dressed looking poor.  I was there with Mickey Mouse and Wendy in white 'window' boxes.  On the beach, I approached one of the girls, skimming across the sand like on ice skates.  She didn't think she was going to get to be in the play.  She was hiding.  I floated up to her and told her not to do it.  I tried to read her mind.  She thought for sure my old annoying dorm roommate Chelsea would get the part, not her.  I told her that was nonsense, that Chelsea had already lost.  The girl wasn't looking at me and didn't realize I was flying.  Finally she did notice, and was amazed.  She started flying too, and of course was very cheery after that.
