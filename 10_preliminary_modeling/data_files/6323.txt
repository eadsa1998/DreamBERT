This dream was short and to the point. My girlfriend and I have been together now for almost two years. The relationship that I am in is incredible. We match together perfectly. Anyway the dream that I had was of our wedding (the church, the reception and honeymoon). Of those three the reception is the most vivid. Everybody was drinking, dancing and having one great time. Melissa looked as beautiful as ever. I myself didn't look that bad. Then on the honeymoon we went to Disneyworld. I personally have been there three times and I can picutre Disneyworld real well. In my dream Melissa and I were riding on all kinds of rides I remember from being there before.
