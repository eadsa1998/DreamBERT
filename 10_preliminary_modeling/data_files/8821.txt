I was working at the computer, and I had a separate file for each of the seven different sections of my dissertation. I was cutting and pasting text from one section into another, trying to get everything where I felt it really belonged. I had the idea that I should add another chapter, which would express only Freud and Jung's perspectives on each of these sections. Or, what I might imagine their perspective to be on each of these sections. I should also move my researchers observations from Chapter 4 into Chapter 5 and combine it with what is now in Chapter 5 as overview.
