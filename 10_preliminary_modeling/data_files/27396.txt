I find myself in a small kitchen. It seems to be on the second floor. My cousin, girl age 19, is with me. We decide to go for a walk. As we are walking we pass a large field. A wedding seems about to take place. I see the bride, also a cousin, age 24, dressed in a bridal gown. One of my aunts (can't remember who) came up to us and asks us why we aren't ready. We assure her that we will hasten home and get ready. On the way home we pass a fruit store. My mother and dad are just coming out the door. I angrily yell at my mother for not having reminded me to get ready. We approach the house which appears to be an apt. bldg with an unusual number of steps leading up to the door. As we are ready to ascend the steps we are accosted by 2 boys. I ignore the one who attempts to speak to me, noticing that he has little hair on the top of his head. I say to myself that he has no more hair than my boyfriend. We go up to the apartment. The next scene is in a church. I am standing in front of a mirror. I look at my bridesmaid gown and discover it is extremely large in the waist. When I look again it has changed to a house dress. I remember feeling very relieved and reassuring myself that it wasn't the gown but the housedress that was too large. I ask someone (don't remember who) if there is a washroom somewhere. I enter a doorway and see a number of men milling around. I remember saying: Heads up.
