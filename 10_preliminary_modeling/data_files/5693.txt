[1997-07-23] I was in a place I was unfamiliar with but I was in the living room, I knew that. I was sitting on the floor in the middle of the room. There was no furnishings in it at all, I have no idea why I was there. I was aware that behind me, sort of at the far wall there were 2 boys. They seemed oriental I could hear their murmured voices, but I couldn't understand what they were saying because I do believe they were talking in their native tongue. I knew though, that these 2 boys had been brought there to be tortured before being killed. Now in the kitchen which was in front of me, there was another boy, and all of them seemed to be around the same age and I would guess, from the voices, 10 or 11 years old. The one in the kitchen didn't seem to be in any particular danger, he was just out there playing with a small sized ball I would say, a Ping-Pong ball or a superball or maybe he was just simply bouncing it around. I don't know what happened. I don't want to know.
