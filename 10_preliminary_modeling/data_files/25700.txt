 I am at Washington University with my mom, my brother Wally, and Wally's friend Hal Jackson. We ride bicycles into town. I am near the Baseball Pub in Oak Valley. There is a stream with a cement bottom. The cement is a conglomerate. I see many northern pike and a long rainbow trout in the stream. I have a green and yellow spoon fishing lure on a string. I toss it out in the stream and try to snag the trout. The trout swims away. My sixth grade teacher Sherry Devine is there. I ask a man what time it is. He says it's 8:00. We need to be back in town by 8:45, so we need to hurry back to Washington University. There is something I want to do at Washington before I leave there, which makes me want to hurry back there. I lose $5.00, dropping it on the ground. I chase the money down by Sundial Park. I also dropped other money in my key safe. I snatch it up and shove it in my pocket. I plan to get a ride with Wally. I forgot his car has a dead battery. He needs a taxi to tow his car to Washington. I have several shoes: two black converse hi-tops, and two types of white tennis shoes, one shoe of each type. No cars come on the road that could jump-start Wally's car. My mom's car isn't strong enough to jump start his car, and it is at Washington.
