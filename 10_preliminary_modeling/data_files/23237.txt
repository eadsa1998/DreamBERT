The dream begins with Jim Duggan.  I tell him it is a coincidence that after not having been in contact with anyone in his family for so many years, I hear from two in one week (which I haven't.).  Then he becomes Joe Duggan, and we are discussing Jerry Seinfeld.  Joe is very critical of the show as being immoral.  I argue with him that just portraying selfish people doesn't make it immoral, that it is just entertainment.
