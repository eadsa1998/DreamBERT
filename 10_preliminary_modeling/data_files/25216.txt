 I'm at a hotel. I see my friend Marge Drummond there with a few other women. My high school crush, Harmony Allure, sleeps in my room. There are three beds there. She goes to bed early and her feet stick out at about the knee from the end of her bed. I have to sleep in the same bed as my sister Heather. I pull out six or seven water bottles with spray tops from under the blanket on my bed. There is a monster or some creature being created from dead leaves that collect in a swimming pool. The creature may be back from the dead. He/it is picking up a slice of watermelon that is lying on the ground next to a manhole cover on a busy city street. There is another man like him with him.
