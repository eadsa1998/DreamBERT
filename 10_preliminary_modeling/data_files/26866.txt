 I'm at a bar with two of my friends. We have a beer. The bartender makes up shots: drinks for the others and I. I'm hesitant to drink it. I feel a lot of pressure to drink it, but I really don't want to. I resist, and decline the shot tersely, asking for the tab. The bartender is visibly disgruntled by my rejection of the drink. I examine the check closely, making sure I didn't get charged for something I didn't drink. The bartender is forced to throw the drink out. He throws it out outside the back door of my home in Oak Valley, which is where we are. The bill is for three beers and two shots.
