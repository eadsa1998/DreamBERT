I went out with Ann to see somebody. She called somebody and the father of the man answered the phone. I could hear him say he isn't home as I was by his house. His house was dark and it was an old, shabby one. The homes were all shabby. Ann went into the house and a friend and I went out to look for my car. I took out a flashlight and we walked thru a field. We stopped by an old house or barn. I flashed the light under the building and looked under there. I saw two eyes flash under there. So I flashed the light all over and finally spotted a rat running. He ran up a pipe and down into water. He went under to the sewer. I was in Rivertown in a field. There were two tents up. The boys were camping overnight. I looked at the Sweeney Hill place of my boyhood days.
