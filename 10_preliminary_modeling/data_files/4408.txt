["Trying to find the TV channel."] I am in a room with a TV like the one in my bedroom. I am using the remote control to find a channel. It is very confusing. I can't seem to change the channels, then I get a PIP screen of a different channel. I try and look in the TV Guide for what's on. I find the date July 16th, which is today's date. Then I can't find dates on any of the other pages. It is frustrating.
