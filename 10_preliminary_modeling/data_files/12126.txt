I was at this place with rides. I think it was the Gold Coast. Dad and I went on this Giant Drop type of ride, but two lots of people go up on the same rail, on the same side. I pressed something to make it go down, but people were going up. I couldn't stop it, but the ride operator stopped it, just as we hit the top. I saw this other ride but we didn't go on it because of our experience with the last ride.
