Paul and I were lovers many years ago. I see him surrounded by his adoring fans. He looks up and says, "Who is that?" I say, "B." He doesn't recognize the name, so I say Lydia (I think) which was my name when I was younger. He realizes it's me and comes out of the group to meet me. We meet and embrace. It is very tender. We obviously still love each other. He is pregnant and old and soft. I lovingly put my hands on his belly to feel the full belly with child. Then I gently touch his face. We walk together in an embrace, kissing very tenderly now and then. I ask how he is. He says, "Married, did you think I'd just wait after you left me?" I wonder how I ever managed to leave Paul Newman. He has children in his marriage. He says, "It's my door; I want it shut." He knocks over some kitchen metal things that were propping the door open and it shuts. She comes out. She is pretending to be mad at him, but she is only affectionately scolding him. I pick it up and say, "I'll do your toenails." Paul says, "Mine?" He's quite content for me to do that. I say, "No, Tia's, your daughter's, if she'll let me, so there, Mr. who-loves-pink-and-gray" (or who looks good in pink and gray). Now I have a picture of the weeping willow Paul and I kissed under. I look at it sadly with loving regret. Paul sees this and sighs, looking at me with love. We both love each other so much, but it won't work because he is married and has a family.
