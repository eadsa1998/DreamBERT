I was at a film crew party. My dad and Robin Williams were there. People were asking Robin Williams for his autograph. He thought I was going to ask him for his autograph, but I told him that I just wanted to shake his hand. I was thinking that you can tell a lot about a person that way. He told me that I could shake his hand any time. Then my dad, Robin, and I were in a room. My dad had a bag full of Rune Stones, that he was showing to Robin. I was somewhat miffed because my dad isn't really much of a mystic and I felt like he was trivializing something that I valued. I made some kind of patronizing remark and my dad angrily stormed out of the room. He was pissed off that I had made him look foolish in front of Robin Williams, who he wanted to impress. I told Robin that my dad was a brilliant man.
