The area to the west side of the house was much bigger, and Dad had made like a little petting zoo. And there was this one thing with this stone wall and this railing like they have at Jungle Park, and there was a little pond with about three or four mallard ducks in it. And there was one duck that somehow got outside the little area, that they had like an island of sand and then a little pond for them like they do at Jungle Park for the flamingos. Well, I took some bird seed out of a can and I had climbed up on the wall, and I was giving the ducks some bird seed. And Dad said that I used up all the cereal that wasn't wet with milk, and [laugh] I said I had given them some lettuce too. And I can't remember what else we had back there, and I can't really remember too much more about my dream. I remembered something else. I was laying on the bed naked with Clark, and Clark was asking me like, "Can I touch your boobs?" And I told him, "No, of course not," in kind of a joking manner, but he was like trying to touch me anyway. And I was like pulling his hand away and stuff. And then he tried to touch me down lower, and I took my seat and I clawed his hand and his other hand was coming towards his chest and I bit it. And then we started like wrestling and stuff, and somehow I managed to keep him away from me. But next thing I knew I was drawing this mummy ?_ picture and I was hearing Mom and Dad talk about trying Clark for doing that. That was bizarre! [laugh]
