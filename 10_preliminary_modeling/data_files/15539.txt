I went to the cinema and saw about 10 minutes of Tree of Life. Casey Affleck was in it as Jesse James and was like 'this is my land' in a gravelly droning voice every few seconds and it was really annoying. The cinematography was nice though. The next session was starting but our plane was in 2 hours. Benjamin and I found 2 dogs and a few children dead with their heads cut off. I thought Rover or another dog did it, but then this bad CGI purple rock type humanoid monster came and finished them off. It talked to us and teased us, eating any people that came and we hid in a building. We then ran out to a car. It ordered pizza and ate the delivery man. Then after a while it silently took the car doors off and turned out all the lights. I closed my eyes, scared, and waited for it to kill me.
