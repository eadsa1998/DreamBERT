["Fighting the man in prison."] I am in prison. A huge scary prisoner, male, is coming toward me with the intent of beating the hell out of me. I come out of my cell knowing he will beat me and knowing I can't win, but by God, I'm going to try hard to survive. He comes at me and we grapple. I bite, poke his eye, and do anything I can to hurt him and fight back. It makes enough of a nuisance that he backs off, admiring my bravery and doggedness. I now walk freely down the hall and down a long flight of stairs to the cafeteria for lunch. A woman hands me a toasted piece of bread. I tell her I don't eat bread, and then accept it, changing my mind. I gather up a plate load of food. I am safe now.
