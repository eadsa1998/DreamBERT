On a plane with my boyfriend. It was like being in a big room -- white and pink. Delays. Repair men in white jumpsuits and masks with tubing doing repairs. I remember being worried about safety. In a big group, like a retreat setting. Everyone's got food but me. I was late or last in line, so I had to go to a special line and get just a dessert.
