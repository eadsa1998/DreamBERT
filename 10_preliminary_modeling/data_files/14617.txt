I was staying somewhere and so was Eugene. We had been there for a few days and we were sort of friendly. I was packing up, as I was leaving, and Nips are Getting Bigger was playing, and then Don't Tell Me Now. Eugene was playfully kicking things at me. He handed me a pair of socks and our fingers touched. Then we were at Nana's and they were locking up the door to the hallway and the dining room. I had to go into the hall, then go to the dining room and lock it, but it didn't lock and the alarm went off. Mom and Darren were outside on the rocks. I asked for help and they were like 'we don't know what to do'. There was this waterfall slide which I went down but I didn't take a big enough breath. Calvin was in the water. I was then on World of Warcraft. Eugene was alliance and Calvin was a gnome. We were on a quest or something and we had to go to the 'reproductive system' (doing it in Human Biology at the moment), from the stomach to the female parts. Dennis and Charlie (both from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia) were wearing robes. Charlie was a small gnome. They fit in, but Dennis stood out a bit. Once a year for a 'week', Dennis slowed down and it only lasted like five minutes though and then he was back to normal again. I was trying to remember who were best friends, whether it was Dennis and Charlie or Charlie and Mac (in real life).
