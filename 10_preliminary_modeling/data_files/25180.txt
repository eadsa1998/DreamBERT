 I'm outside in a dark place. It is night. I'm in a group of people. There is a large satellite dish there that is changing the direction it is pointed. It points into the ground and digs into the dirt sometimes. People that are there are moving their arms in different directions like they are tuning into something. I think they are trying to contact other beings. There is place in the sky where the clouds are cleared away and brilliant stars show through. I have a black cast iron frying pan. There is a spotlight that is looking for people. It might be cast my aliens. My friend Stephen and I evade the light; the aliens don't see us. The aliens might be taken over. Stephen and I stab and beat two men. We hit them with large rocks in our hands and club the men with the frying pan. We try to injure or kill them. The men are resistant. They adapt to the beatings. The blows don't hurt the men anymore, and the men turn on us.
