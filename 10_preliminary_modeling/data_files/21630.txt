I was sneaking away with something to put in back. I had to crawl thru a small hole and put the thing in a shanty. A boy saw me and came over to the shanty and saw me, so I had to tell him I was doing this to surprise the boy. It was raining and the water came down the tracks. A boat came down. I sort of helped to push it and my pants got wet up to my knees. This turned out to be a log I was helping to push and then to steer. I had to lift it sometimes and then push the front end. We moved it into the house. I went down and walked Al Lasko into a room with myself. He was supposed to be a girl. In the morning he was to go upstairs and tell them we got married.
