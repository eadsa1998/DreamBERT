In my dream I was in my room in Santa Cruz and it was late afternoon/early morning. I was on the telephone calling my ex-boyfriend's house (He lives with his family) to get his address. His brother answered the phone and I asked for Mike. He said that Mike wasn't home , but was on his way out to Santa Cruz to surprise me. I remember feeling happy and scared at the same time. I asked him more questions but we were disconnected somehow, almost like we hadn't ever been on the phone.
