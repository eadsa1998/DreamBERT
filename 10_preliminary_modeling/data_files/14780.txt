I was going down a street to get somewhere. I went up a hill, which was sandy and there was a car coming and there was a scooter in the way. The car was then a motorbike and I moved the scooter out the way. The guys who owned it came out of some place talking to each other. I left and went into a building. They followed. I kept scaring them down the stairs, but they finally came all the way. One of them was really smart and they were all fairly ok people. Someone asked why I wasn't dating any of them and was like 'they're small!'. One of them was called George. He pat this blind puppy's paw. I got the dog and I asked, "how do you do it again? George?". He was talking on MSN. Two guy friends were sharing a house thing (like a flat). There was a gay couple across the road. They got into an argument outside because the gay couple because there was no fence. They were saying that they couldn't raise "our baby".
