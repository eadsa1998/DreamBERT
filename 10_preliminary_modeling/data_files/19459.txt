Met a man on street who looked at me rather closely, and I at him, both seeming almost to recognize the other. Shortly thereafter he approached me again, grasped my hand, and announced that we had been in same Battery in the army. He had thick arms and I suspected he was a boxer. He did not tell me his name at first, and I felt acutely uncomfortable because of my inability to recall him. He had a scrap book of war pictures and I stared surreptitiously at the corner of a page where his name -- Dutch Clarke -- was written. The pictures (apparently photos) were poor (dim). He had one plain postcard, encircled by a band of white paper, and on the band in block letters were "LEE LAFOREST." I asked somebody what kind of an athlete Clarke was.
