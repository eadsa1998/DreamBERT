There were a bunch of army men sitting on top of a school desk out in the open. Several different kinds of army men. Someone told me those had been Chuck's army men. Chuck's mother said Chuck used to play out in the busy highway in front of their house when he was a little boy and he caused terrible accidents. Philip Martin said he was going to kill Chuck with the very pistol Chuck had traded for the army men. But when Philip went to shoot Chuck, the shot gun shells were too old and he didn't know how to re-pack them. The school lunch room was busy. It was just before lunch. It was the most hectic time. A lady worker asked me if she could have my orange. I didn't really want to, but I gave it to her. I was riding in a car with a sunroof with Elena. I wanted to hear. I was hearing the song. It was beautiful. Debussy. Claire de Leu (La Mer) and it went on for 2 hours. I was humming. There was an aluminum barn. Chuck was bammed on the outside doors of the aluminum barn the cows were in. They were getting mad and ready to stampede. A swinging gate went across and back against the fence (180 degrees). The little boy could fit between the fence and gate but the cows were gonna be mad! I showed William Chuck's army men. He loved them. My mother had planned a Christmas dinner party. Invited me, her and 3 guys she wanted to match me up with. She said she'd picked the seating arrangements by chance--over and over till they came out how she wanted. I started telling her about Chuck's army men and she walked away.
