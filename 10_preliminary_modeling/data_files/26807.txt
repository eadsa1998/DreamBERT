 I seem to be at my friend Kevin Simpson's house. There is a party-like atmosphere: lots of people are around. My friend Norman Noman is there. Our friend Hank Anderson may be there as well. A young Asian man is living in Kevin's father's old room. He gets ready for work, which may be at McDonalds. He sees to put a lot of cologne on: some added smell is strong.
