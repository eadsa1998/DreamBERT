I was hosting an event for a group of women in my home. Two of the women were there to help me set up. One of them arrived a little earlier than the other and I had already talked to her about what needed to be done. I walked her to the room that I thought we should use because it had the most room to set up folding chairs. When the second one showed up I had to do the same thing again. I walked her to that same room and explained that I was intending to set up folding chairs in rows. I was motioning with my hands as I talked. We went into another room that looked like an attic storage area except that it had very high ceilings, like a warehouse. There was something that resembled a ladder that led to the lower floor. The lower floor also looked like a warehouse. There were things on this upper level that we needed to take to the lower level, I think they were all empty boxes. On the lower level there were things that needed to be taken to the upper level. I said something about this being temporary, through the holiday season. The things on the lower level had things that I had moved for or replaced with holiday decorations. Some of the things on the lower level were empty boxes from Christmas decorations. We were running out of time and we still had very much to do. I began standing at the bottom of the ladder and just pushing these things up to get them on the upper floor so someone up there could move them to the area where they needed to be stored. I needed time to take a shower because I was getting so hot and sweaty moving these boxes. I was concerned that I wouldn't have time for a shower.
