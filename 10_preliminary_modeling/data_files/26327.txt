 I'm with Black Elk and his people, when they're in the rocky, cliff-like area with many rounded crevices, ready to surrender to the soldiers. The people are tired and hungry. They have a few guns and spear-like sticks. The approaching soldiers are shot. I'm sitting with some people, and it is pointed out that my arm turns black when I flex the muscles in it. I have a stick that is a spear with a sharp point. Some people walk close to us and go up on the rocks above us, as if they walk up a rocky ledge of stairs. One of three people is like my friend Bill Hanson, but is also my friend Melanie McDyss' boyfriend. Like Bill, he has long thick biceps. These three people are not our people. They are like soldiers. I stab the man who is like Bill with my spear. It goes deep into his pelvis, his loins. I think I may be in trouble because I haven't killed this man: he may be able to retaliate. I stab all three people. I stab one man in the temple, and another in the chest. There may be a woman in the group. When I stab the people my spear sticks in the white wall and I break it off and stab then with the other end.
