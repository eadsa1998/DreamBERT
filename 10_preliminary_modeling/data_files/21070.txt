I saw Joe Lasko. He was at our home and was pouring out whiskey. I saw my good old golden bull. I saw a freight car look like a skeleton. It had cutouts all over the sides. A fellow said it was to be built into a home and the holes were to be windows. Two men were fighting. One was getting the of it. The one put a mirror in front of his face and that seemed to take the fight out of him.
