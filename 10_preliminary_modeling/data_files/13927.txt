Mom got a message to steal some cars from a library. This lady would always leave her alone with the car and then Mom would drive out with them. The fourth time, the car was really fast and I was hanging on the back of it. We got to her house, which was different. She had bought some small bits of land at this park. There was a tiny area, like 5m by 2m. She needed money later to help Granma and got a message to steal a car, but it was at someone's house so she didn't. I said it was like GTA 4.
