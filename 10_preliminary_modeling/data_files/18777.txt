The second dream was when I was in Canada. We have two houses there. I was with a colored girl and a white woman. The colored girl never said anything. We were all walking across the countryside, and we came to our cabin. We went inside and saw a man sitting on a sofa watching the fireplace. He said nothing to us and acted as if we weren't there.
