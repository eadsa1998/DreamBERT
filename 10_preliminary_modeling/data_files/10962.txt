I was walking home down a country road at dusk when an unknown man began chasing me. I was terrified and ran furiously toward my home. I managed to get in the back door and lock it. I told my brother (12) to get my mother from the garden to help me. The man went around front and up on the porch. Just as he was opening the storm door, mother and my brother came up and shut him between the two doors. His head was smashed and the whole scene was very ghastly. We then called the police to carry away his dead body.
