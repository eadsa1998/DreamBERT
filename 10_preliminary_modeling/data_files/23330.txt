This dream must have taken me into the future for I found the present church much altered and I recognized very few of the people there. The interior was very dim and sombre, partly because rich memorial windows had displaced the familiar ones. The pews were ranged in semi-circles leaving a large space vacant before the chancel. I asked someone if this was for T. H.'s chorus. "No," was the reply, "They sing in a picture." Probably this was a poetical way of saying that they had passed into history. The pulpit, I think, was gone. The greatest change was in the organ. The original part was still discoverable, but it had been extended across the entire front of the church. There were ranks of silver gray pipes rising before the chancel windows. Some were so long that they rested on the floor and disappeared through the roof. Smaller ones flanked the minister's room. At three places there were keyboards and benches. Mr. Y. was in his old position playing a stormy composition. When great power was demanded, he jerked a clothesline which swung open a large door in the case of the organ, and the tones pealed out with overpowering effect. Then the door would swing to with a slam.
