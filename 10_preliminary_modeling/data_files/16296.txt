I was having Frieda over for dinner before we were going to take off on the car trip with her somewhere. And I had my tape machine recorder in my purse so that I could record what was going on, and I had my purse on my shoulder and going downstairs with Frieda behind me. And Mom said, "Tell Frieda about when you had Susan over for dinner and you recorded everything that was going on." And I didn't want to tell Frieda that. I didn't even want to tell Frieda I was recording now. So I just kind of went down, and we sat down and started eating.
