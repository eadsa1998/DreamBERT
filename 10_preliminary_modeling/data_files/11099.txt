It was 10:20 at night and I had forgotten my biology book over in the boiler room. Lights are out in our dorm at 10:30 and I had to get permission from our house director to go over to get it. It was real dark in the boiler room and I couldn't find my books. I looked and looked and finally went to the third floor to look for them. It was still dark--but a little lighter. Then I saw a bunch of kids from home. I talked to all of them at first. Then I was talking to this guy who I used to go with. We talked and then argued and then laughed. Then he crawled out the window and I had a party with the other kids. But I was unhappy because this guy left and I didn't have my biology studied for the test. I was also worried because I was going to be campused because I didn't go straight back to the dorm. When I went back, Mrs. Sanky, our house mother, hollered and campused me.
