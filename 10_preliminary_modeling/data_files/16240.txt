We were watching this movie in the living room on the TV. It was about these fish and how they act, and how they kind of like babysit each other and stuff. And that's all I remember about that, and then some thunder woke me up. But then, when I went back to sleep, I dreamt that I was looking at these clocks because I was doing something before and I can't remember what I was doing. I sat here and thought about it a little and I can't remember. So I was looking at several clocks and I realized that neither one of them was giving me the right time. They had crazy whacko things. And then I woke up when my alarm woke me up, and I realized what time it was.
