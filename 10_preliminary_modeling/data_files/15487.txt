I was at the old house in my room. Ezra was watching TV in bed, across the hall. Three zombies came down the hall and I used these long metal things to stab them. They kept coming and it was like a game and they had to be stabbed with certain things. A later level was in the living room and some needed to be stabbed with a long pole and others with something else and I had one in each hand and twirled and killed them. Later I was with a group of people and I said I had been on my own since then and they let me go to finish killing them. I killed two hard ones and then there was a 'ghoul' and it required a weapon that I didn't have, so I ran and almost ran out of health. They were annoyed with me after that.
