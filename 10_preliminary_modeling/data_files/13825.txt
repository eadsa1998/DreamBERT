I went to the movies. I had to go in by myself, but the school was seeing the movie too. I had asked the guy at the door if I could take a seat and go somewhere else, but decided to stay in the cinema. Later, I was at Calvin's work and I was telling him I saw some movie, which was the 4th in the series, but what I was actually describing was The Eye.
