I am on a sidewalk watching a newly-constructed street on which at some distance there is a tremendous flood of newly poured cement flowing down the street toward me. I watch, fascinated, at its inexorable movement. The street ends oddly enough at a blank straight concrete wall. When the first creeping fingers of lava-like cement reach the wall, I shout out that it has touched the wall!
