I recall being in the forest then falling through a hole in the ground landing on a large tower with a glass plated ground. There was no way of getting off the tower that was 16 stories up. I remember being very afraid and then trying to move away from up on the glass--I'm afraid of heights. Then I hung off the side and fell. All I remember is falling, then awakening.
