We were at a bazaar and I was buying by twos. Bobby was doing stunts up above on a bar or something. Brownie said a horse in the fifth race. He showed me it. Madeline, he said that was his neighbor's horse and a fast runner. I called in a junk man to collect up all the junk. I was eating bananas. They were mostly spoiled and Grandma's had some fresh ones. The lights wouldn't go on by Grandma's in PA. I finally got one to light, but the cord was smoking.
