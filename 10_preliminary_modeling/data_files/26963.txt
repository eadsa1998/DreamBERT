I dreamed that I was trying to swim in a huge swimming pool that had no water. The fact that there wasn't any water in the pool did not hinder my activity. The pool was built at a 45 degree angle. I was swimming downward instead of upward. My actions were deliberate and I did not feel any anxiety while I was swimming. I remember very clearly that I was swimming downward and that I was slightly confused about the thought that I had to get back up to the top of the pool. There was a very short interval of the dream that I do not remember, but I do know that in some way or another I did get back to the top of the pool and I started to swim down again. (I did this twice.)
