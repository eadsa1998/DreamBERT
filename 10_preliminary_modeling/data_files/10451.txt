I am part of a HEALING TEAM and we go to a friend from Church who has been very depressed; I tell her to repeat the prayer from JULIAN OF NORWICH: "All shall be well" and to really believe it. Then we plan the next meeting at which time we will do some active imagination. - shift: with Marita who is very thirsty and I make her a glass of bubbly orange juice. Marita tells me some disturbing news that I had "pneumonia in my bones" according to the doctor who spoke with her while I was with my friend from Church. Vague ending.
