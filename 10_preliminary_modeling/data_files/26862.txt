 I'm fishing in a canoe with my dad and other people in other canoes. People are casting near a brush pile. My Dad is overzealous: he gets too close to the brush pile and moves too fast. He falls in the water. There is a boat and a canoe there. Everyone falls in the water. My friends Hilary Nano and Nat Miller are there, having a sexual encounter in the water. I go over and poke them playfully. There are some things on the lake bottom that I pick up, including rope and film.
