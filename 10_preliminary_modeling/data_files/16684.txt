some orchestra conductor or somebody was going to put on this great big, huge, giant oratorio that was like really really long and had like 100 singers and 100 orchestra people and stuff. It was the classic late Romantic gargantuan m______ sing, although I had the feeling like the composer was a rogue like Handel or somebody. And the goal was for them to do this totally without any electrical power of any kind from the grid. So apparently I think they were going to put up, they weren't going to have any amplification for one thing. And I saw lots of lights on the music stands and there were like Christmas lights along the stage, and they said that they were run on solar energy. And I was supposed to participate in this thing, but I really didn't have a score, I didn't know what we were doing, I was just going to kind of bumble along. I was supposed to play piano, but quite frankly I thought I could just sort of hide in the back and pretend because there would be so much going on, nobody would hear me anyway. So basically the little bit of action in this dream, I was in some foggy stuff I don't remember. One thing I really do remember was I was behind this huge, huge, huge bleacher thing that was really risers that went like -- you know how most chorus risers have like three or four tiers! Well, this one had like 10 or 15 tiers to it. It was like really, really high and really, really steep. And I was thinking, "Gee, the people up there can't be afraid of heights in order to do this thing." And I was just thinking, "Gee, I hope this thing doesn't fall on me back here," because I was like back behind it. And then I woke up.
