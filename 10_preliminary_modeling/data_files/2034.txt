I meet a used car salesman, Mike R. We go on a tour of Russia. I receive letters from disabled people who enjoyed my writing. One woman simulates a 9-day camping/fishing trip with her husband because she was so inspired by my writing. Our group sees a train that has finally been made wheelchair accessible. It's run by FIRE. And that is repeated in an important way. I see the ornate circus like cars with tubes of steam and fire coming out of it. I walk ahead of the group and run, enjoying the movement. I go too far and they turn left and I run back to catch up. I see a slow MR woman at the end. Then I have a conversation with a Russian boy (teen). He says something about eating something. I am shocked because if he eats it, it will be harmful to him. He is doing it as a sacrifice. I say, "Bear and Eagle, there is a difference. I would never do that" (harm or kill self for sacrifice). I have my books and try to sell them. I buy a mineral water and a grape soda (both l/2 full) at a store. At first, I was going to take them, but decide to be honest.
