 I'm outside a building. Inside the building are my classmate Mark Helmut and my sister Heather. Mark wants to fight with me over a dessert. My friend Terry Foss is in the building. I don't want to fight Mark, and get tangled up with either Heather or Terry. But he wants to fight me, so I break free of the disdain from Terry and Heather and fight him. I have the head of a pig, which has hair on it. I'm carrying it around by the hair. There may be other pigs around. There is a little baby that is crying. A parent of the baby is there. The pig head and I are in the alley of my neighbors the Robbin's block. There are dogs in the alley that are barking.
