I was in Room --- at the time of my English Literature class. Miss W, my professor, was presiding when a girl entered requesting that I come to the office at once. This girl (who I cannot describe) barged in just as I was about to answer a question. I flew out of the room but this girl was not there, by the time I came to the door.
