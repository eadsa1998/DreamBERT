Arvonne/Theresa sells her stuff at an outdoor flea market place. I am going to help her. She gives her stuff to me and I look through it to see if there's anything valuable or that I would want. I see photos and ask if she still wants them (she used to be a famous movie star). She's not interested. I'm moving her stuff. A man comes up and is interested in the saxophone, but he is sarcastic and I decide I don't like him. He says, "I'll bet you can't even play it." I sneer and say, "Even if I could, I wouldn't sell it to you." He gets rude and then leaves.
