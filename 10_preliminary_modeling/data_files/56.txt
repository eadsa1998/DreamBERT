I'm moving in with a family - part of my original family already lives here, presumably I've got other, younger brothers and sisters. They've been taken in out of necessity. I've still got options to moving in here but not attractive ones - except they're getting more attractive. The head of this family is a hail-fellow type who's really concerned about me and a TV set - seems to think I'll really be pleased that, coming here, I'll have my own color TV - but not a big one, or a fancy one, he wants to warn me about that. I remark that I did have one, it's not even color, but it's not as if I've been deprived you know.
