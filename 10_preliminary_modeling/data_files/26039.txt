 I'm in a math class. It's the first day of class. My classmate from Brimson Sue is there. The teacher is like my calculus teacher from Brimson but is more mellow, easier, and geekier. Sue and I are the only two students in the room. We get assigned to do our choice of odd or even problems from the book. The teacher didn't instruct us on how to do them, just to do them. We are having a class meeting on Wednesday, and the problems are due Friday. Sue and I look at the problems. She is wearing a short gray cotton skirt with a pair of white spandex biker shorts underneath. I wish she wouldn't have worn the spandex under her skirt! The problems in the book have boxes with circles in them. Depending on where the boxes and circles are, they are symbols for addition and multiplication. Sue and I flirt, and I want to kiss her. At one point I walk down the hallway and see other classrooms. My classroom is much more laid back then the others: they are all working hard. The problems look like this: ___=_, where squares and circles represent different numbers and operations:<tt
