He kind of made a pass at me. Then he took me to his bedroom but there were a lot of other people in there. The bedroom was very contemporary. It had many spaces with partitions. Everything has these very curvy lines to it. I don't know how to explain this at all. He chased all the people out. I realized there were more people in there still. He was trying to get them all out. When he did, we realized his wife was there and she was unpacking and talking to him like nothing was going on. She didn't see me there. I tried to sneak out and she saw me. I ran out the door. Instead of running down the two flights of stairs, I simply jumped over the rail and landed down two flights. I thought I was safe there but she threw something and it hit me. I just kept running.
