There is a big fire in town - L. City. I am living in a wooden building with Edward. Very scared. He is very nonchalant and won't help me pack so that I can return to B. City to our old place. I have to do it all by myself. Arrive in B. City, see our upstairs neighbor who is cool towards me but later feel more accepted.
