I am picking rocks and bird seed out of the dirt and throwing them to the animals. The bigger animals try to eat the good bird seed and I look for bigger rocks to give them. I find piles of white agate and crystal. Then I find carved horses and birds that go together like my wind chime. I am surprised. What's this man-made thing doing out here in the woods? A helicopter or plane lands. It's there to take me somewhere. I decide to go to work, using the short cut walking through the woods and up the hills. The girls and I walk, trying to stay hidden from the helicopter people.
