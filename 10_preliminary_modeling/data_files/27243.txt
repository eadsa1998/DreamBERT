My date called for me and said we were going with a group of his friends. When we got to the car I saw about six people in the back seat. The driver was a boy I stopped dating a few months ago. My date got in first &amp; then I did, but there was no door and I was afraid of falling out. I had to cling to my date in fear of falling &amp; the driver kept driving up and down hills very quickly--it was something like an amusement park thriller. I was terrified.
