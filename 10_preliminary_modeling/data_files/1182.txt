I am going down main street in M City looking for a sale on film. I have a long and meticulous list from my father. He was serious and told me to write down the numbers exactly. I feel a little nervous that I might forget them or make a mistake. When I get to a store, I realize that I have to wait until he sends the film for me to get prices for developing. I leave the store and start walking back down the street. A salesman from the store follows me. Then I see two men, one looking for work, seated on a train or something. I think he's me. Across from him is the salesman. The man asks the salesman if he likes his work. The salesman is ecstatic. Oh yes, he loves it, there isn't any better job etc. The man says, "That's the positive side, now tell me what you hate about your job." The salesman slumps and appears more honest. He says, "Well, no one will believe you, or give you a loan." The man says, "Ah, that's more like it."
