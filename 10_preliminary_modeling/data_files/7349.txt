As he came down from the attic with arms full, I asked if I couldn't help bring things down, laid down the newspaper, went upstairs and brought down an armful of bed linen. When I picked up the paper the front page was missing. I asked if he had it. He said no the paper had not yet been delivered. I offered to divide the sections with him. Then the maid who was cleaning the room said she had taken it and was so sorry and wouldn't do so again. I said, "That's all right. You didn't know everything the first time you cleaned here." We looked in the wastebasket, found the crumpled paper, and smoothed it out.
