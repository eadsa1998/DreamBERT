The last dream I remember having is I'm running through a big mall with my girlfriend. We run in to stores and hide. We are being chased by two guys that are trying to get this big diamond ring that is really expensive. The guys are about 20 and wearing jeans and black shirts. My friend and I run into this room with old fashioned things from the1800s. Everything is all dusty. We get a bunch of clothes we like and put them in suitcases. There is another door, but it is locked. The janitor that worked at our school walked in the door we came in and we asked him if he could open the door. He did and it led outside to behind an apartment building with a playground and metal stairs everywhere. We climb up to one of the rooms that is empty. Then I always wake up. I have had this dream a few times.
