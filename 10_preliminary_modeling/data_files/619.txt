I am in a sheltered place having a picnic. A friend, who is a therapist, another woman, my father and brother are there. The place is like a picnic area with a roof over it. Someone gives me a picture of my father alone and of him and his brother together. It is a nice picture and looks like it came from a certain local print shop. My father is working hard and seems unhappy. There is some kind of oven there and he is trying to get the top off it. My brother decides to help him and my father gets into the oven and goes back to being dead.
