["Speeches, dreams and writing."] I am in a meadow, standing in a line with Celeste, a woman writer and another woman, making speeches. I am impressed the woman writer is writing and I realize that's what I should be doing. Writing. Celeste is a helping friendly presence that is encouraging me to do speeches, writing and dreams. It feels very comfortable. Later, there is a man, friendly and we might be starting a relationship.
