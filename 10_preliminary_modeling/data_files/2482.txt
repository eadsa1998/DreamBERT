I am sleeping on a couch thing only I'm sort of outdoors in the city. I hear sirens and wake up. Some people say there'd been a terrible fire. A whole building burned. I asked them if they had been the insurance company and would have to pay. They say no. I am glad for them. I get up and look down the hill to the city to see where the damage occurred. I hope to see a big empty place where people can build, or just space, because the city is so crowded, but no, still a mass of buildings. Then I notice it's time for breakfast. Someone brings me mine, a bowl of eggs and milk and a live, little furry animal, cute, fat and cuddly. I call it an anteater because it has a skinny, long nose. I'm supposed to kill it and eat it for breakfast. I look at it and pet it. It's so sweet and cute, I feel sick to my stomach! I can't bear the idea of killing it, but I'm hungry. I make several weak attempts, but I just can't. A man (Tom Selleck/Alfonso) comes in and he kills it for me and plops it whole into my bowl of milk, and as he talks to me, I eat. In one spoonful, I see three pads of its little feet. I am queasy and think, "My God, he wasn't gutted or anything." I stop eating. I can't! The man talks enthusiastically about some neat group of people who are really good about understanding peace. I say/bragging, "Hey I know them. They sell things at booths and I often join them." I show a menu thing, "Holly for Peace" and things like that they sell. The man is impressed and grabs me for a long kiss. It is supposed to be pleasant, but it's kind of lifeless and boring and I try to make it more pleasant. No dice.
