I was at a legal conference with people from my law firm.  I was getting increasingly uncaring about my role and obligations there.  I was late one day, like an hour or two, really late.  Just didn't care.  Was more concerned about being happy, carefree, or feeling joy.  We met in a large conference room, like at a hotel.  I'd play around getting ready in the hotel room, and be late, but I also felt increasingly free from it all.  At one point, I was in a conference room as everyone was leaving and clearing out.  Mom was there, and I had a desire to go to the piano and play it.  Started toward it, but decided against it, too many people still watching.  I was interested in how they cleared out this room, for the next function or something.
