I was mad at my boyfriend Jeremy for going out for a burger and fries with a friend.  So I went outside, running, onto a ramp.  I ended up at our online friend Starla's place.  She had a lot of friends over.  They were looking at pictures.  A girl signed one with my good online friend Del in it, signifying that she had a crush on him.  I was supposed to deliver the picture to him.  I ran, and got stuck behind a Marriott hotel.
