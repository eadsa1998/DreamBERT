I am a self-centered, arrogant woman. A man follows me around being angry and sarcastic. I get into the driver's seat of a van and start to drive. I'm going the wrong way and look for a break in the median bushes so I can make a "U" turn. I see one, brake hard and barely make it; now I'm in the fast lane, going the right way. I'm trying to change lanes to the "slower" lane and see ahead of me a tiny baby (one day old) on a tricycle pedaling along, keeping up with the flow of car traffic. I change lanes and so does she and we collide. I pick her up, concerned. She's not hurt, but she's feisty and annoyed with me for getting in the way. She's wearing a pink suit and a red light flashes near her chin. She's sort of an alien high tech baby doll/person. I feel a rush of concern and love for her and pick her up, and now I'm taking care of her. The angry man smiles and croons a sweet happy celebration song because finally this selfish, self-centered woman he's been in love with and waited for all these years is caring for someone else. That means soon she'll wake up to him and return his love. He is very happy. She just looks at him like he's being silly and comments to someone that he's doing some "silly male mating ritual." But she likes him and is realizing a sense of peace and joy and love she'd not felt before.
