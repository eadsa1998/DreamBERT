I was in the agency without a badge again-in fact I had my peace symbol on a thong hanging around my neck.  I was in a class which was being taught by Bill Clay.  During the course of the class, I became increasingly anxious about not having a badge, to the point where I actually began to feel sick.  I asked to be excused and left the room somewhat doubled over.  Bill came out with me to see if there was anything he could do.  I decided the best thing to do was to confide in him.  Somehow his wife was there too, and I told them both.  I told them that I had had numerous dreams about being in the the agency building without a badge-and now I really was, and I thought I was going crazy.  Either then or later they advised me to go to security and explain the whole thing to them.  First, however, they got a doctor or a nurse, or both, to come and give me some kind of sedative to calm me and maybe put me to sleep.  We were then outdoors, and I was supposed to lie down beside a culvert until an ambulance came for me.  While I was there, feeling very groggy, several friends and Bonita came by to see how I was.  I remember thinking how long Bill had been away from his class and worried that they would give up on his coming back.  I also wished the sedative would finish putting me to sleep or that the ambulance would come.  Finally it came and I struggled to get on the stretcher.  Later I explained my story to someone else, but not sure whether it was security.
