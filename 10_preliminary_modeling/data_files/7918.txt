I was with Mike M, but he did not look like he does in waking life. He was taller, a bit younger looking and very attractive. We were practically running through a mall because it was almost time for a movie to start. We were going to see K-Pax. He had my hand and was practically pulling me along telling me to hurry. I finally let go of his hand and let him go on ahead. I think we made it in time though I don't remember for sure. I was with Mike M again but this time he looked different. We were at my home but it looked like my birth home. At some point I had woken up, in the dream not from the dream, and realized that he had moved in with me while I was sleeping. He was concerned about me because of my life situation lately and how I have been feeling as a result, particularly that I have been sleeping too much. He came in and sat on the bed by my side and was trying to help me wake up and encouraging me to get out of bed. I got up and headed for the bathroom. He had gone shopping and bought tons of stuff that was sitting everywhere. There was barely a path to walk through the house and patio. There was a lot of frozen food that I wondered why he hadn't put it in a freezer but realized it would never fit in my small freezer. I don't even know what all of the other stuff was. There were some decorative items and some kitchenware. I went outside and many of my relatives on my mother's side of the family were there. I know Larry K, Bruce W, and Sue K were there, they were making comments about Mike M and all of these things that he purchased. BJ came up to me and offered me some yellow gum. It was a small roll and she broke a piece off and gave it to me. She said Mike M had given it to her for her breath. I felt bad and apologized but told her that he had a lot of very fine qualities and that he truly is a wonderful man.
