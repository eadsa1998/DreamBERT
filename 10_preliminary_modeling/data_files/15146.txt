I was at Ted's (How I Met Your Mother) with Robin and Marshall. The other day, Marshall had made some hash cookies/muffins and tonight we were going to eat them. We were sitting around and Ted gave us all a cookie. It was nice and chocolate-y, but there was no 'hash'. I thought maybe it was in the muffins instead, so I went into the kitchen and on the table were a square container and a round container. One had muffins and the other had cookies. I took a small muffin (it was the shape and size of a squashed mushroom) and took a bite. It had choc chips and was really nice. We ended up all laughing and messing around. I said something like 'Didn't you make them, Marshall? They're really good, but what the hell?' and he laughed like he was stoned (we all were). We acted like we were high for hours. Robin pretended to be reporting. Ted's boss came and Ted was actually supposed to be working. He said he had a video of one of the nights here. The video had him saying 'Do you know about this door?' and he seemed crazy. He had a girlfriend who was very modern and fashionable.
