I was at this school thing and we had to sleep in this room, which was separated into sections. There were beds and lounges scattered around the room, which was quite big. Darius had hired prostitutes for him and Eugene to lose their virginity to. They were in a different section to me, and pretty far from me. I was upset and angry about it. I went to my section and saw the prostitute and Eugene kissing and then a curtain covered them. I went to sleep. Later, Ezra was in a bus which scraped the wall. Ezra thought I was angry at him. Eugene and Darius were waking up. Then I was closer to their bed. Darius was stroking his prostitute. Eugene woke up and said "now I have to break up with her", which he said was the hardest thing for him. I grinned and said "she's a prostitute" and he realized and laughed. He looked sort of weird, but still hot. Then I was in a car with Dad, Ezra and him. I was trying to take photos of him and put my phone on silent. He was singing. We were getting McDonald's but I said I didn't want anything because of the pink burger I'd gotten the other night (in real life). We went to a shop and I wandered off to the newsagency. I was crawling on the floor and the lady that worked there thought I was dodgy so I left. I saw Eugene wandering around. Ms Solomon was in this place with others. There was a thing in the water and at a certain level it would attack something.
