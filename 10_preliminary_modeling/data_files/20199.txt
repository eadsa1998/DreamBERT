I was on a pass from an institution. As I walked down some stairs, the thought occurred to me that since it was wrong for me to get pleasure from seducing children, why was it all right for chess players to get intellectual pleasure from playing chess? Both seem to be a waste of organic as well as mental energy. I recalled C. G. Jung, who said mental illness is caused by the failure of the mental energy, or libido, to meet a certain situation. I reasoned further that this energy could not cope because it was too weak. And for that reason, it should not be weakened by seducing children or playing chess, but should be conserved so that it will be able to meet certain situations.
