I was at a summer resort where there was one big cottage and some desolated ruins of cottages. I was with women and girls only. The place was on the sea and was quite hard to get to (through dense woods, etc.). One day a couple of us took a walk down the road (away from the sea) and came to a road going off to the right where a lot of surly looking men were having an argument over an automobile. I remember seeing a big, tall colored man there, in particular.
