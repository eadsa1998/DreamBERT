Mary and I are sitting at a table, she at one end and I at her immediate left. I can't take my eyes off her. She is radiantly beautiful. Both of us know she is fatally ill and going to die. But she appears as I remembered her before the illness, except that she is paler. It were as though the disease has not yet begun to cause her severe damage and distress. Mary is laughing and chatting and charming. Other people are also sitting at the table, but I'm not sure who they are. As the dream begins, Mary is talking to Adam (who appears to be about 10 years old). I cannot see him. He has a dog, and Mary, laughing, tells him the dog stinks and should be examined by a veterinarian. As Adam and his dog go away, Mary bows her head, and in a low voice, says, "I hope they keep that dog locked up for 2 years." Both of us know Mary doesn't have 2 years to live. I study her face thoroughly, looking for signs of disease or any indication that she may be in pain. I think I see a lump on her face, but I am wrong. What I see is her eyelid. She looks at me and we tell each other, "I love you." Mary knows I have remarried. Somehow, Mary and I had arranged to have our marriage annulled. (In the dream this seems so logical, but upon awakening, it made no sense to me at all). I think I ask Mary if she likes Bonnie and I also ask her to tell me what she thinks of Bonnie. But Mary is noncommittal. She merely laughs and chats on about other things. I am so delighted to see Mary.
