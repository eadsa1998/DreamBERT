I was seized by a bunch of men and then shoved into a black sedan. I next was taken by the seashore and I thought I would be killed by them throwing me into the water. I remember next being left on a lonely road. It was cold that night and I can remember I didn't feel too warm. I remember vastness dark and dreary, but I walked until I saw a light. This light was small as a pinpoint and I was drifting in space. I remember turning upside down and I had a dizzy feeling. I tried, but I could not approach the light. I woke up then.
