Working with someone on an SAID document related to the sponsor program. It had already been created. I was redoing it. The original had included a bunch of pages with numbers from some kind of survey results. It only had a couple of items on each page. I wanted to redo it to consolidate it but also so they would be in the back of the document rather than the front. I was discussing with this other person the best way to do that.
