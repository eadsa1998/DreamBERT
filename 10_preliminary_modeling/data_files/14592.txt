There was a quiz game show thing. Celebrities were on it and so was I. There was now me, Natalie Portman (or looked like her), who was the champ from 2001, and a singer guy whose name started with 'M'.  Natalie Portman had 9 points. There were two groups and one had 42,000 and my group had 41,000 (I only had 10 points and I thought that there was something not right). The questions were like quotes and producers of movies and stuff and was hard. Mom said we couldn't leave now and so Ezra and I were now tied for the same prize. I can't read what I wrote but it looks like it says she had 'picked us to go to [something starting with a u]?'. The prizes were left over birthday presents. One had Payton on it. On Facebook, there was a guy called "Thalky", which I thought must be Preston Garfield's real name.
