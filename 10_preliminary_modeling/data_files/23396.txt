There was a group of us driving down a busy road with big buildings (like Las Vegas). We were arguing about where the movie theater was. Then I was in a big commercial super-duty truck (a Ford that is used at my husband's work) with another woman from the town where my brother lives. We were making a left turn on a highway and I stepped on the gas to go fast because a car was coming. We turned out but I couldn't turn the wheel straight and we drove right in front of the car that was coming and turned over and started to flip down a hill (on its side). I was thinking, "I should jump out the window." When the truck stopped, I was outside looking at it but the other woman was lying next to the truck and some people were picking her up. Then we were in some apartment and the people that were arguing were there. The woman was wearing nothing but began to put on her bra. My husband was there and was watching her. I looked at her and she was very beautiful with long sandy blonde hair, a perfect body -- her hips and thighs were voluptuous, but not fat at all and she had a very nice tan all over -- no strap marks. I didn't want my husband looking at her.
