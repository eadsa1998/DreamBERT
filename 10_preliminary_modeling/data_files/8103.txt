I was with Bill C. We were outside of the office someplace. We were talking business. He was worried or upset about something and was talking and talking. I finally took my hand and turned his face towards me. I leaned in as though I was going to kiss him and then pulled back. Then he leaned over and kissed me. It was just a couple of very light kisses. Then he pulled back and made some sort of facial expression to imply that he had really enjoyed the kiss. I think we were back at the office now. I don't know if he wanted another kiss or what but I was saying no that I couldn't do that because I work for him. He wouldn't just drop it.
