The King of England is very proper and shy and he loves Spring Byington. He courts her in an old fashioned way. She is shy and turns her head away. He is very hurt and I see his face, looking sad. She turns back. He says, "I see, then you don't care." She says, "Oh, no, that's not it." She tells him she loved the sweet gesture of handing her a tea tray so elegantly. They smile at each other.
