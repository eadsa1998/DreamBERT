 I'm with my dad and we're leaving to go somewhere. I start to tell him about a dream. He says I'm already really knowledgeable about them; that I know all about them. I'm riding a bike with my dad on the back. We're riding by Nantucket's Furniture or The Grease Pit. I see Olie Kecker, Patrick Bergman, and Bud Slick, all people I know from high school. I say hi. I'm riding over roots from trees that are sticking out of the ground.
