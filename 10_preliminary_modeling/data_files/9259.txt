I went to ITT to start a new temp assignment. I went to say hello to Jo. As I was going back to my work area I noticed that Kim was there. I went back and leaned just barely over the partition by her desk. There were three other people working for Jo, in addition to Kim. I asked Kim what she was doing back there. I don't know if she answered me, but asked me a question and I said that I was back for another temp assignment.
