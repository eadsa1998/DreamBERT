There were two children, very young, about 1 and 2 or 3 years. The youngest was a boy and the oldest a girl. I was sleeping and these two children were trying to sleep with me. I held the youngest very close to me as if it was my very arm and yet I knew it wasn't. The other child was sleeping on the other side of me. Occasionally the mother would enter the room. She would make a comment or just observe the children. She was not attractive at all. I recall saying to her the last time she came in, "Are you going to join us?" A feeling of sexual sensation was arising in me, but was quickly dispelled when she answered, "No, my husband is coming home." I do not recognize either the children or the mother.
