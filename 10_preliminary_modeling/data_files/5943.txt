Am walking in the corridors of a hospital looking for the exit. Keep trying doors to see if they lead to steps down. No luck. All the walls are newly painted and are a shiny enameled white. There are no direction signs and no numbers or anything on any doors or walls ... just the bright white paint. I wonder why Fire Exit not seen and realize this probably painted over also and this carelessness disturbs me. Now and then pass an alcove and there see a patient or two lying on mattresses on floor and talking to visitors. At end of a long corridor, I am confronted by three or four doors. Open one slightly and see a patient inside and realize there is no exit here. Finally pass an administrative office with cashier's window in wall. A nurse directs me out.
