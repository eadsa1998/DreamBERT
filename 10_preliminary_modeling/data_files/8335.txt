I was working with two people to create some kind of an Excel document in the computer. I think it had three worksheets. All the data we were putting in belonged to one person. The other person was giving us the guidelines - what needed to be in, what categories, the maximum number of entries, etc. I was trying to figure out how to take the data out of other documents and get it into Excel, through importing, cut and paste or some other. There was some confusion about what we were putting in it. There was confusion about how many entries on one. One was a list of names and addresses. The first time we did it, it didn't go in right - like in the correct column. The next time it was either the wrong list or the wrong information. We got all that figured out but saw there were too many entries and needed to cut it back. I think we were going to do a mailing. The person who owned the data was fretting because he didn't think we could cut it back as much as the other person was saying that we needed to. We were going to. We went through and starting deleting entries.
