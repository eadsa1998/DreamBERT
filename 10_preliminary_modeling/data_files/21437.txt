Carter and I went hunting. I saw a crow fly by. I was going to shoot him, but Bob said it was not a crow. I looked at a clock and it was 4 o'clock afternoon and only 1 hour to hunt. I saw a young man batting a bottle which some kids were pitching to him. I said, "Don't you know you will break the bottle and the glass will be dangerous lying around?"
