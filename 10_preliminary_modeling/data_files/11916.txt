Ezra, Ramona, Tiana, some guy I made up and I were doing this thing and we had to defeat people to get out. The first two were creepy things -- skeleton blokes and stuff. We walked through these woods to get to the next place and some creepy people followed us. I was wearing my light blue "MB" shorts and the blue top with brown sleeves and had been for the last few days. We got to the next arena place and we had to defeat John Travolta. The other guy (call him Joe) started fighting him and they both had some cool moves. Joe won and I picked him up and kissed him, saying he was the man (all friendly stuff) for beating John Travolta. The next two "Gods" were a face of a lady in a square box (who Ezra talked to and that's what you had to do, because she was lonely and then she left) and the last one was the "oracle" (who was a face of a lady too). But when Ezra got there, we told him the whole thing was a joke. Then we were at some creepy China town place. They had little animals, and one tried to escape. I cuddled some cute animal. We had to get special cards from a lady to go places. We talked about getting costumes for the quest thing and John Travolta had said to get good escape gear and I wanted to go home to get my shoes. Tiana dressed up and Ramona called her mother.
