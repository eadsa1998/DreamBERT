I am sitting on a couch. Tomas is there. I am surprised. Then it's night. It's time to go to bed. I am wearing see through undies that are very sexy. I turn on a light so I can see my way on the path to the next "room" house where we all sleep. I get there late. 4 or 5 people are already in the beds. They say, "You can sleep on the floor." A man touches the carpet to show me how soft it is. He likes me. I don't like it, but I lay down.
