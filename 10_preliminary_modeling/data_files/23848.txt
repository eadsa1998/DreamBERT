I am being told about a trail that leads out of Moab, north of town.  I am being shown this trail, from the air.  I can see the cliffs around town, and there is a trail that everyone takes and knows about north of town that I see below me.  But I am being told about another trail, a really cool trail, that it is called Water Canyon, that is less known.  Someone and I are talking about it, how to get there, how to find the trailhead.  I am given directions to it, and then shown it from the air, high above Moab.  It does lead out north of town, but where the main trail goes to the right, this Water Canyon trail goes off to the left, and then straight up a very steep hill, over the top edge of the cliff.  I can see the whole trail from the air.  I am most fascinated with the part that leads over that lip edge at the top.  I follow it with my eyes, over that edge.  I can feel what it would feel like to get up over that edge.  I also dreamed of a mountain lion, I could see his mouth, and face, close up.
