I was watching a movie set in the future. This lady was the boss of this company. There were lots of bottomless drops between desks and sections. She yelled at everyone about something. Some people had devised a plan to steal her pills. I was there. Everyone brought me stuff as a cover to get the pills. Kevin (The Office) had a piece of paper with a name on it and I said 'what am I supposed to do with this?'. There was a round container with pink mesh on it and this girl had two of them; one was to stop her period. I took one to give to the guy to look after it. Adam Baldwin played a character in it and had a daughter called Alex. This girl collected animals in a car for something and it crashed. Someone decided to save the baby animals and they were upside down in the car. Then I was with Mom and Ezra at a shop. There was a game where you had to look for this lady with the lights off. I crawled to look. There was something to do with Emma Thompson. Then Rover was on the floor and Jensen Ackles was next to him and I said to Ezra 'you just wanna touch Jensen'. Dad couldn't find the lady and made us leave. Nana wanted to play Runescape.
