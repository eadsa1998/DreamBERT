I dreamed it was New Year's Eve and I was with a date. He had given me one purple orchid to wear. I was standing talking to my date when another fella I knew came up to me and handed me a box with two white orchids. I was very annoyed because of the fact that I was with another date. As he handed me the flowers he told me that there was a note in the box explaining everything. I started to read the note - but woke up before I got past about two or three words.
