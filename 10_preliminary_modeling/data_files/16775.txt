We are in another state flying home, but we must make a stop in Paris, France. I don't think it was just Academy students on the plane (probably family and others as well), but I know we blame Dell for such an inconvenient little detour. We just get to some airport in Paris, go through this tunnel on a subway train (I don't know, one of those airport type trains) and leave again. We left early in the day, and got back at about 7:00 p.m.We left earlier that day. We were then in a house that I don't recognize for what I thought was a Christmas party. Laura was there and I see Kerry. I say, "Hello," and want to ask her for some contact info so I can talk to her again but I chicken out. (I also remember a segment where I'm talking to Kerry on AOL Instant Messenger.)
