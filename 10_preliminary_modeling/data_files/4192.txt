["Blocked from traveling home."] I am driving my van. Dovre is in the passenger seat. I am annoyed with her because she has the tape recorder and the radio over on her side of the van. I tell her I want them back close by me so I can turn them on and off when I want to. She doesn't want to do it. I then point to the dashboard and reach for one of the cutout areas you can punch out to put the devices in. I say Shall I put it here? She is mad at me and doesn't answer. I almost punch out the area. Then I look ahead and see a barrier on the road. Lovely tall glass vases lined up, blues and pinks and empty. I pull over to the side of the road. Now what! How am I going to get home to M City, which is where we are headed. I get out of the van and start walking down the 2 lane curvy mountain road. Paulina says You can't park here. It's a no parking zone. I say no problem, I only parked the wheelchair, not the van. Then I remember that I did park the van but dismiss the problem and walk on to find someone to talk to about this problem of the barrier. I see a long line of beautiful glass pieces displayed similar to the vases of the barrier. I keep walking. Now I see some people, and am in some large building. I am looking for the person in charge. I see a large room where some people are. This is some small town festival. I go out of the building. I now have a cell phone and the phone number of the woman in charge. I call her and explain that this is the only way I can get home without turning around, backtracking and finding another way. I explain I am a woman in a wheelchair and it would be better if I could get through. She says I could go back to Sweet Home and go that way. I say but that would take so long. Then she says OK, we can figure out a way to let you through. I thank her, pointing out that the crowds are thinned out now, since it is late afternoon. It shouldn't be too much of a problem. The small town is named Wheeler.
