Walked outside of house with my husband and there was a new plowed dirt road straight ahead then curved around hill. We walked around hill on road and below us was my friend Dan with his truck and tractor and trailer. He said he was doing some work down the road. My husband asked him about something and I noticed the tractor was a big mechanical mosquito. Then Dan said it was poisonous -- a plant that my son and I were holding and smelling sometime before; don't remember when. I disagreed and said "Are you sure?" Dan said "Positive." I said "Let me go get it and show you to make sure." I ran back toward my house noticing the new plowed road was high up and there were holes in the road that if you drove on it, it could fall through. I ran to what was an old chicken coop and climbed in a small chicken wire door. There was the plant but it was dried up so I turned to look for more and I noticed there was a rattlesnake so I turned to leave and right where I was before there was a rattlesnake with the dried weed in its mouth. I tried to move fast but the slow movement (where you can't do anything, no control of self or movements and you want to cry) got me and more and more snakes appeared.
