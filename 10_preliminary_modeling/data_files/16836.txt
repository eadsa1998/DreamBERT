I've just joined a band (or put one together). It's unclear exactly who the other members are. We are at someone's flat for a band meeting. We're in a city, at an apartment of one of the members - the drummer I think, who is the only female member. I can't place who she is. She's reminiscent of someone, I just can't think who.She's blonde, with shortish hair. She is a practical type, has a job in the city, as is very busy, but has found the time for this somehow. Some of us don't live in the city, so we're talking about rehearsal arrangements. The drummer girl has offered her place as a place to stay over. The second guitarist (I am the first) is my brother. He'd have to stay over too. The singer might be my friend Ralph. There's a general a general feeling that the singer isn't qualified for the job. I've just realised the singer wasn't Ralph - it was one of the front men in a Blues Brothers cover band I saw in Germany. I don't remember the bass player in the dream. There's some discussion with the drummer about how she's going to practice in the apartment due to the noise. I suggest buying a practice set of rubber pads that can be placed over her drums to mute the sound. Then there's the issue of the singer. The drummer can sing, and in my opinion would make a better front person. She looks a bit like Debbie Harry in her Blondie days. Perhaps Ralph was the bass player. Later we leave the apartment and go back to our cars in the suburbs. But I can't remember where my car is parked. I walk the streets growing more and more stressed out.
