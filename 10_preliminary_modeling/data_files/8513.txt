I was living in an apartment building that had several floors with several apartments on each floor. I met a young man living in the community who expressed a romantic interest in me. While I was surprised and hesitant, I was also trying to remain open. It seems that he has always been interested in older women. There were a few kisses and holding hands, but that is all there was to it. We had good conversations and there certainly seemed to be a good mental connection. There were numerous times that we went for walks around the neighborhood. He introduced me to another woman, I think it was his mom. She seemed to be around my age, much thinner than me, with shoulder length platinum-blonde hair. She seemed kind of cool towards me. Each time I met and talked with her it seemed to get better however. He was very affirming of me, in little and various ways letting me know that his affection for me was sincere and not sexual. That made me feel very good. In spending time with this man I began to meet quite a few of the other residents in the neighborhood. One time we were sitting with several of them and I made mention of this fact. Someone mentioned an elderly gentleman that lived in my building. There seemed to be a shared opinion that there was something bothersome about him - like something that he does regularly bothers people. I don't know what it was. Initially I agreed with it but quickly realized this was unfair and possibly even unfounded. He was going to be moving into another building and the other people in the building were kind of joking around that they were glad he was moving and now he would be someone else's problem. I thought this was kind of mean and inappropriate talk and it made me feel bad.
