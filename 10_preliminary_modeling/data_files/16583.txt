First I dreamt that I had to walk to Fourth Street Shipping in the middle of the night for some reason. And it was really hot. And I was in Westport, and I got there and I got the package to them, and coming back I went by Circle Lake Park, which is totally in the opposite direction, but I passed it in my dream. And I had _______ because they were blocking the way, and then there was a school bus dropping kids off at that hour, and as the bus stopped I kind of ran ahead of it so I could get by all the commotion. And then, when I got back, the next little scene was that it was daytime and for some reason Dad had to go out of town to deal with something with Uncle Charlie and Aunt Polly, I think, and I think Uncle Carl was over here at Westport helping us out with some things around the house while he was away. And I think Mom was going to hang some wash outside and she wanted us to play a tape for her in the bedroom out the window like you do so that she could hear it out there. Now in my dream by the bedroom receiver there was still a tape deck, and for some reason Uncle Carl was sitting in the bedroom and he wanted me to go ahead and put it on, but then he started to work with it, and when he turned it on, it was on tuner and it was on like 94.1 or something, but he said that a message popped up and then displayed that said, "Low power, do not adjust the volume." And he said that it translates to that the whole house was on less than 110 volts and that the power company had somehow messed up there. And Uncle Carl went to go tell her that, and he called her Nimp. He said, "Nimp, guess what?" In real life he doesn't; he calls her Maggie or something like that. And just about that time I woke up.
