I saw two winners in the paper, so I called up a bookie, put them in and he took them and they paid $12 apiece. I dreamed I awoke and then I tried to remember the names, but couldn't recall them. I played two. I thought they were the ones, but when I looked for the results, I didn't see them as winners. Now I awoke and I can't recall the names I saw in my sleep. I walked into a field where there was a mare with her colt. The small colt came up to me and licked me like a dog as I pet him. Then we went behind a screen enclosure and there were a few crows inside imprisoned. When we opened the door, one of them flew out. Clyde Fleming came over and gave someone $10 for a funeral. I was surprised.
