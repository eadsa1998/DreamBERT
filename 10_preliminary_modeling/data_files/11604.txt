I was in my car in a parking lot and was just backing up to leave when a man in a big car (kind indefinite) pulled around my car and ran his car into my front fender. We both got out and I kept running from spectator to spectator saying, "You saw it; who was in the wrong?" I was very conscious of needing to get witnesses. The driver who had hit me remained silent and played no further part in the dream after he got out of his car.
