 I'm at Armstrong High School. My friend Eve Nichols is with her friend Dave. They are standoffish at first, and share and awkward hug, and then a peck of a kiss goodbye. After the ice is broken with that, they fully embrace and kiss. I'm waiting near them, around the athletic doors, for a ride. I walk back to my locker, which is on the end of the junior lockers, near the commons.
