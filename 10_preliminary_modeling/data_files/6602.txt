I am in a house but a Catholic priest is to confirm me. There are candles. I lean over and whisper to him only he now seems to be Rev. S. (a Protestant minister). "Don't let my mother know, she'll feel so terrible but I am doing this for my husband to be." For this is preliminary to marriage. I think my husband to be must be D. if this is necessary.
