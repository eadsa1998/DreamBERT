A fellow said Uncle Miltie won and paid $15 and the Boot horse won and paid a bundle. I played #7374. Ann and I went to St. Andrew's Church. The pews were low steps like at a circus. We walked over them to the front one, then sat down in front. I was riding on some funny do-hicky. I balanced myself with a stick. Then I hopped along.
