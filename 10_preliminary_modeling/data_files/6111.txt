Tuesday night, 3/93 I was in my friend's apartment (it was a girl from work, Charlene) and I was amazed at the apartment. Jaimie (from my old job) answered the door. I was happy and surprised to see her but I didn't feel I needed to make a big deal. We were sitting around. The apartment was big. It had a contemporary artsy look with pastel colors (pink, green, yellow, peach and black). Charlene asked me if I noticed anything different about the place. I named some things like the furniture, pictures, etc. None of it was right and then after much guessing Charlene finally said, "Jaimie's here." They didn't think I realized that Jaimie hadn't been around in a while. I was very glad to see her, but I just didn't go on and on about how long it had been since I had seen her.(147 words)</span
