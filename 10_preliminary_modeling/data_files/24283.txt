Dream at Nate's (a friend from high school and college) where I was in a New York style bar and the service was bad. Laura Manning was there, the girl I've never met but have drooled over since I saw her picture for the first time (we have a lot of mutual friends). She was a waitress, and we jousted over the order when she billed me for three things, expensive drinks, when I had only ordered something small. I went in and told her mean, but young and pretty, supervisor I wanted to talk to her. The supervisor looked at me, and said she wouldn't do anything, but I was allowed to talk to Laura about it. I found her, and the sexual tension pushed us to compromise. Something about me buying her skittles or something. We left together for Uncle Kong's farm. Earlier, I was in the downstairs living room of the club hill house. There were a lot of people there, and many of them were hot girls. There was one I liked in particular, and another one was attractive, but I liked her less. But of course, I only have the courage to take what I don't want, or rather, what I don't mind losing. Everyone was sleeping in the same room, in a big pile on a mattress pile on the floor. The girl I didn't like as much, but took, she was long and slender, with that translucent cafe skin that Puerto Rican girls often have. She had long straight hair, and a narrow face. Her breasts were round and firm, but not too large. I started there with my mouth. Her body arched and I went lower with my lips. I got to her lips, and before I could start on her, I realized I had to go. Shaun (a college friend) showed up and gave me a ride. His car was old. It was strange, since he acted like he had been there in the room even though he hadn't. He came on to me, and when he dropped me off at my uncle's ranch, he gave me 35 cents and said to call him. I said I had a phone already, but took the change. Kong looked thinner than usual, and he was wearing his purple bandana. I was worried about him.
