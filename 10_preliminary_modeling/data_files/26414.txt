 I'm at a baseball game for Armstrong High School Alumni basketball players. I arrived late, and the others probably didn't think I'd show up. My friends Nate Nelling and John Kulik and others are there. My mom and I are going to play on one of the teams. My friend Simon Naver is going to pitch for the other team because they seem to not have enough players. The other teams are Armstrong alumni as well. I see Simon pitch. He pitches fast, and I don't know if I can hit pitches like that.
