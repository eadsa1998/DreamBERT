I was walking through these weird woods and I was thinking I should teleport to Ardougne. Eventually I saw Dad's old work and went past it to this video shop. As I passed I heard William, it Was Really Nothing playing and I was singing along to it. I was in the video shop, and outside it looked like there was a fire (there wasn't really, it was just effects). There was a creepy dark room.
