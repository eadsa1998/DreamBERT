I'm still having crazy dreams about the undead, from reading that Dracula book. The concept is supposed to be so scary and so horrible, which it kind of is, but it's more cool than anything, you know what I mean? So last night I dreamt that Sandra like came to me in my sleep and like laid down next to me, and somehow I had the notion that she was undead and she was like visiting me. And she wasn't going to, she didn't scare me, she wasn't going to take any of my blood, but I was going to like give her some so that she could like come back to life or something dumb like that. [laugh] And that's all that there is to it. I kind of faded into consciousness.
