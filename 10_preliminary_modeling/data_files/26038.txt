 I'm in a mall. A new security system is being put in at a store after the mall closes one night. We are supposed to have the lights turned off, since it's after hours. I change a light bulb in the store. I stand on a tall ladder that is very wobbly. The new bulbs I put in are blue. They seem to snap into place. To get the second bulb in I hang from a ledge and try to get my leg up on the ledge, and then hang by one arm, putting the bulb in with my other hand. I think I am a long way off the floor. When I hang down, I am only a foot or two above the floor. I let go, and easily land on the floor.
