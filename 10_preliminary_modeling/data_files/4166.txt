I am visiting Mary Sue and Dwan. I want to see their remodeled house and the progress they are making. I look at the outside. I see new window panels just like the ones in my remodeled room. Long and narrow. There are still more to put in but they have put in more since I last looked. Now we are inside. Dwan and I are talking. She asks me about being a lesbian. I grimace and say I just don't feel comfortable with it. Dwan says why not? I say I don't know, it doesn't feel right. She laughs at me, because she and Mary Sue are quite happy together. I then look into a bedroom they remodeled. It is very pretty with a double bed and lots of pillows and comforters. I see another bedroom and look in there also. They are doing a good job of remodeling their house.
