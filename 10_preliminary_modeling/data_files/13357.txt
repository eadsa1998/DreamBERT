I was playing some game where you have to kill a bunch of people. I was about to go to the last level and I was collecting arrows and stuff, when I realized that I had forgotten to save (which you had to do at a typewriter). I tried to go back but couldn't. I had some McDonald's. Someone was going to take it off me, so I took a bite.
