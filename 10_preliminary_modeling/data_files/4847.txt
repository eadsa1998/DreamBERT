["Expanding the building."] I go into a building. I need to speak to a man in a particular department. I enter the main lobby. I want to write a note to him. I find many sticky yellow sheets of paper and try to find one which hasn't already been written on, on both sides. I can't find one after searching diligently for a long time. I write down 1 A2 on an already used paper. I try to go up an elevator but it is wobbly and I am worried it will break. I go back out realizing the building is not safe and needs fixing. I get into my van and proceed to drive up the tunnels in the building. The tunnel is white, rounded and narrow and going up. As I drive, I realize I am creating a better situation. The tunnels are now more wide and easy to go through. The building structure itself is stronger and better built. I feel nervous in the narrow tunnel as I drive quickly up to the top. I get out and go back to the lobby. Not many people there. I take the elevator again. The window screen seems wobbly and I stand away from it, nervous it will fall open and I will fall out. Then the elevator stops. I try and push buttons to get it to go up to the 5th floor and then we can go back down to the 4th, which is the floor I want. I works and I get off at the 4th floor. I notice no one is in the waiting room, still thin of company. I feel slightly uppity about that.
