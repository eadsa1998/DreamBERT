I leave school and am looking for my ride. I see Ellie and the baby at my van and start to walk up the sidewalk. Then I don't see them. So I go back to catch a bus. Then I remember that I'd parked my van in the back parking lot. Veronica comes out and says, "You have an important phone call." I know it's about Paulina's decision to live or die. I go in. Someone shows me a big black phone and I push the blinking lift button. But the call is cut off. I go to the office and Veronica works at getting the connection. Now there is a spelling contest. I spell two words correctly. (Paulina is the other contestant.) I spell "ABSOLUTELY" and it is correct.
