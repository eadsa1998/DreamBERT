 I'm at Jefferson Elementary school in Oak Valley with my mom. We go up on the roof to get tennis balls. We are careful. I climb on the door first, then use the handle and climb my way up to the roof. When it is time to go down I toss down the old, dirty tennis balls for people on the ground. I get stuck on the edge of the roof. My mom laughs. I flip over the edge and hang on, grappling my way towards the fence along the gutter by which I am hanging. I grasp a handle like that on my dorm room door. The handle turns and the door to a plane opens. There is a balding man inside, who is scary. He is in a plane, and may fall out. I call my sister Ramona and tell her to come over here as quickly as possible. She is watching a movie with our cousin Rich Redding. My mom may be in trouble. I tell my mom to jump off the roof at its lowest point and jump onto something.
