A totally unknown and strange place. Two roads came together in front of some lighted caves. The other side of the road was covered with dense vegetation among which some trees could be seen. The characters: me, a leftist student leader, with a few classmates, and Christ, the character around whom a conversation revolved. Also He was the dweller of the cave. He moved about without difficulty, going through the rocks and also coming from the past and into the future without difficulty. I remember the leader and his sister. They are friends of mine. I was trying to defend Christ and the leader accepted my position and he also accepted Christ, whom he considered a person who was very important for the future of mankind.
