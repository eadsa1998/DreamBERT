I was at a wedding with my mother and lots of friends. First I saw the bride as a friend of mine and then as my cousin. When she came out to throw the flowers she had, they called all the girls, among them myself, and I caught the wedding bouquet and other prizes. I felt happy. When the party was over, we went home. Then she passed by on a bus and we gave her a lot of stuff, but we didn't have time to giver her a cream cake that we had prepared for her.
