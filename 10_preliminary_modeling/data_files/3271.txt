I am writing a finishing part in a play. I am in the M City House and Lucy is rehearsing her songs in the other room. I realize I haven't been memorizing my lines and feel concern and some frustration at myself for leaving it to the last. I won't be prepared. I admire Lucy for preparing well. I write a bit for Mark H to do, about Christmas candies. I think it is a funny bit until I realize he won't have time to get it memorized. I think, "Well, then what would be so wrong if we did it as a staged reading, not an off book production?" I know this is a cop out. I should have prepared, Mark should have prepared. Now the candy skit doesn't look as funny and I pick up the packages of glittery sugary candy from the box and look at it again.
