I was out in some bush place and there was a little deli. Some guy, a girl and I were meeting there because some guy was going to give us $1.1 million for some reason. If we didn't see anyone else on the way there he was going to give us $2.2 million. The deli owner saw us though so we only got $1.1 million. The guy shot me but I didn't get shot. Then we all bought $400k houses. Then it was Sims 2 and I added the families to my play list. One said "Eric Dane".
