Michael J. Fox (who looked like Darryl sometimes) and I are in bed making love. It is very sensual and pleasant. I'm on top. It is slow and enticing. We are interrupted. He gets into a small car that becomes a flashy black 1950's car and drives it around in circles and then down a narrow drive way into a secret garage where he lives in splendor. I see signs for Europe, England, etc. and offer to drive for him as he can't do it all himself. I suggest we get back into bed, but some waitress is in the room and I'm reluctant to do it with her around.
