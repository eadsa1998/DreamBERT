I was signing a duet at the Masonic auditorium on Euclid with a girl I used to go with when I was about 18. We started to sing a duet called "the passage birds farewell," and the audience began to laugh at us. When we looked behind us we saw a number of different animals. The one I can remember most vividly was a turkey. The girl stopped singing and went over and chased the animals off the stage. I remember I didn't sing the duet very well and was worried about what the girl would say to me after we were finished. We finished the duet, and the audience was as quiet as a tomb; there was absolutely no applause, and we walked off the stage down through the audience amid silence. The dream ended.
