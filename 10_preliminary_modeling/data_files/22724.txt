I was at home and it was almost dawn and I couldn't sleep. I went up to the roof to observe and the view was like thousands of houses lit up with lamps and all along the sea coast; it was a beautiful sight. Then I looked over to the roof of my neighbor's house (it must be noted that the scene wasn't what it is in reality) and I saw a little creature, a little boy, hanging by the ropes where the laundry is put out to dry. It seemed strange to me due to the lateness of the hour. I didn't know the boy. I went over to him and tried to carry him and get him off the rope, and he laughed. He must have been about two years old. Then the sky turned light and two nurses came and they told me he was the son of my neighbor (they took care of the child). I was stunned because I know all her children and I had never seen this boy. They took him down and I went to my bed. My mother had gone to the neighbor's house when suddenly I heard a noise and I ran to the neighbor's house and I heard my neighbor screaming that the child had broken his head. There was a great deal of confusion; people were running and screaming. My mother came out too. A while later they told me that the child had died as a consequence of the accident. They told me they had already buried him and I saw the whole family come out on the street wearing blue sweaters. My mother was looking through the window and telling me that the little boy had loved her very much and that she had loved him too, because he was very good.
