["Can't find medical help."] I have fallen off a steep cliff hillside. I have injured my left leg in two places. Perhaps the bones are broken. I am trying to crawl up the hillside to where Ellie is at the top. I call out for help. It is very painful and a difficult struggle. Now I am walking with a limp and with pain down a hall at a University. I am looking for the medical office where someone can help me. I can't find it. I ask directions of the many passing students. They tell me where to go and I follow their directions, only to find another classroom. Now another male student says it is in another building. He walks me outside and points to a sidewalk and tells me how to get there, but I am confused and ask for more direction, except he's gone already. I am very frustrated.
