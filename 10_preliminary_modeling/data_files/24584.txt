We were in San Francisco at this science place, and it started to rain. We got in the car and started driving home. Then, my mom and dad fainted and I started to drive. When we were almost home, my mom and dad woke up and they started driving. We went to my aunt's house and we stayed there that night because we were scared. Setting: At a science place, at my aunt's house and in the car. Characters: Me, my sister, my mom, my dad, my aunt. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared. I want to learn how to drive. I remembered this dream when we were leaving for school.
