I had a bunch of Celine Dion CD's and somebody gave me like one or two to add to my collection, and I was at somebody's house and I came home and I had this box of cookie cracker things and two of the CD's were loose in that box without a case. And I took them off and I washed them with water to get all the cookie crumbs and goo off of them, and then I put them in jewel cases and the ones that I have were professionally done, but there were three extras that were like hand-made, hand decorated and home burned. And I dreamt that I was going to put the Celine Dion CD's in the order that they came out, the order that she released them, and I started on that and I had the notion that she sang "Part of That World" on the Mermaid movie, when it was really Jodi Benson. And there was this one CD that was pink and it had some hearts, and it was one that was like handmade. And I put that one in, because I thought that was the one that had "Part of That World" on it, and it had like a bunch of other stuff, but it wasn't one of those collector series CD's like I thought it was. And before I could do any more organizing, I woke up.
