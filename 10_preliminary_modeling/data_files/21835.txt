Ann and I went to Loddie Fousek's home. I was surprised Ann was behind a screen. He was washing off her bottom with a rag and cloth. Then she was thru, she came out and was putting on her clothes in front of him. She had a big brown spot around her rectum about six inches in diameter. She said it was sore. I said, "You will have to soak it in water." Then I looked at her face and it started to turn blue, a real sky blue. Later I looked at her face and it was all blue. Then it started to fade and I said it would go away and her face would be normal. I was downtown walking, some fellow put out his hand and I shook hands with him. I walked further and met my brother Steve. I said, "Let's go to the car barns. I will give you a ride home in a streetcar." There were two streetcars going by and I said, "See, they don't make as much noise as a bus does." I had on a motorman's hat and a fellow said, "You are lucky you have a job."
