I dreamed that my teeth were falling out one after the other. It happened in a place that reminded me of Bangkok, only while I was there I was with Cassie (former roommate Delaney's girlfriend), Delaney and others. We had taken a golf-cart like vehicle to this closed resort. We were going to play in the ruins, but more people came and started to set up some sort of exhibit. I slid down the railing on the way down and hit hard when I landed on the balls of my feet. They were hoisting picture frames on cables, and wires had strung them all together as they were set up on the ground first. Back at the first hotel we stayed at, I was drunk and so was Delaney, a former college roommate. We were trying to find a parking spot, in addition, find another place to stay. The first place was just a friend's house, and had decor like the 1970s -- all square, with lots of brown carpet. I remember my teeth started to come out in the car. First one, just a chip, and then more started to fall. I could feel the teeth in front were loose, but I hoped it was just temporary and would go away. But it didn't. First one, then more came out. I checked in the mirror to see how bad it looked. It was pretty bad. The canine. I spat the teeth into my hand, and thought to all those movies I'd seen where people had teeth knocked out. I hoped that if I saved them, a dentist would be able to put them back. Then I worried how expensive it would be -- then wondered how all the people who had teeth knocked out in movies, even if they didn't have any money, managed to get their teeth put back in. I dropped some, but didn't know how many fell. I hoped that I'd be able to recover them all. I didn't know if I got them all.
