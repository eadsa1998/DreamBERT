At the beginning of the dream I found myself in some sort of a large room midst many people who are busily preparing for some sort of performance, and one lady leads me to a drum and asks me to play the drum part to several pieces that they are going to perform. Among all the people I can only identify one, an Israeli about 40 years old whom I once knew. I soon found out I was on a boat -- a boat docked in the harbor oil Jaija, Israel. I go up on deck and find out that the Israel-Arab war is starting. I then see many disconnected war scenes from the Israel war, the blowing up of a bridge north of Haija, a naval battle off Haija with the Egyptians, etc. I am quite excited and I fly around the boat and around the bay area in order to get a better view of the naval battle. It seems that there are many middle aged women on the boat who are also quite excited.
