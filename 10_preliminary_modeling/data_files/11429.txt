The dream took place on the first landing of the stairs in the house we last lived in. It seemed that it was about 11 o'clock at night and pitch black. I was standing alone but I felt someone walking up the stairs behind me. Hard as I tried, I couldn't yell out or move as the person came closer. He came closer and closer but in the darkness I couldn't see who it was. As he reached for me I woke up shaking and in a cold sweat.
