I'm with a group of men and women - 3 or 4 of each, all middleaged or older - and we've just come from some seminar or something, it's late, and we're visiting at the house that one of the women - her name is Louise or maybe Betty - lives in, a very nice, small, comfortable house, she's been here for many years, I think she's a widow. We're all very friendly, we're having a good time together. Except for Rita - she's unhappy [for some reason I've forgotten - might have an element of jealousy] with Louise/Betty and decides she'd better leave. I walk with her through the kitchen to the front door, feeling awkward, wishing I could help. She walks on out to her car - I think one or more of the men came with us, and I let them go on ahead back to the living room. I hang back in the hallway - it's rather cluttered, more like a back hallway than a front hallway, but it does lead to the street. Near the door to the kitchen, I notice a folded note on the floor, and I pick it up. Rita must have dropped it. I open it and glance at it; it seems to be for Louise/Betty - I wonder if it's about their problem. I think maybe I ought to give it to Louise/Betty, but then Rita hadn't done it herself, maybe that would be wrong. I go back through the kitchen and decide I'd better get rid of it. I wad it up in my hand as unobtrusively as I can - I could be seen from the living room if anyone was looking this way - and casually toss it in the trash can that's in an open pantry or alcove right before the door, just as I go on through.
