I was waiting in line to see Luke Perry. There were thousands of girls waiting to see him. He and I kept making eye contact with each other despite all the girls in the way. I was the very last girl in line and when I got to the front he looked at me and said, "What took you so long?" Then he gave me a hug and a kiss. Funny thing is I don't really care for Luke Perry!
