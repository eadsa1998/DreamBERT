I went to a class and asked for everyone's notebook. There was a guy with a notebook and it had stuff about a movie called Take That and how it was a gay movie and he looked gay, so I let him keep it. I had met this guy from this event. He came into the class and someone said something about marriage and he got down on one knee and asked if I would marry him. I said "me or the class?" and he said "you". The class were clapping and then I kissed him.
