I'm at a grocery store hoping to meet a nice man I can be in relationship with. This short but good-looking guy comes up and kisses me. I say, "Hey, who are you? Don't do that." I walk away from him. He follows. I see Merle in a shopping cart. I tell him, "This boy came up and kissed me." Merle is a little jealous. I go back into the store looking for a guy. As I'm ready to leave, I find Raul and another guy. We walk out with Merle and Ginny and some others. I say to Raul, "Don't be like you were before; be natural and real." He agrees. Someone says, "To whose couch do we go?" I offer my house. We go to a campground. Raul says he's read about Emily Dickinson. I say, "Yeah, me too. She's into natural drugs." Some people take the campsite we were headed for. We get into a van and drive up a freeway exit the wrong way and cut across wooded area to park next to the original campsite. Ginny has money in her hand. I say, "There isn't any wood for the fire," and then I see some split logs and sticks. [BL]
