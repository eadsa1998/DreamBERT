["Getting ready."]  I am walking with my father and some other people. We are going to go check up on a project we are working on. Maybe a computer project. We stop to have a bite to eat. My father asks a man to bring us a prepared lunch. I open mine, and find a bunch of square things with general information on them. I see packages of cheese or milk. I ask a man if every time I want to eat lunch I will get this same package of square informational things. He says yes. That seems a real waste of resources.
