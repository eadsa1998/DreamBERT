A crowd is gathered. I think we are in Germany. A blind man is trying to show the crowd awards and grants of money our disabled community received for the cause. He unfolds one award and I see the "blue y" raised "$400." The crowd is very impressed. Then the man takes his briefcase with the awards in it and throws it suddenly in a chute. The crowd gasps. He says, "It's worthless. It won't help. What we need to do is march on the president's house, president of a college. I go with him. Most of the crowd goes away. Some follow us. It's dark, so he leads me. We both have canes to feel for holes in the ground as my feet are tender (the ankles). We go to the president's house, passing houses where lesser officials live. We interrupt dinner and present our case.
