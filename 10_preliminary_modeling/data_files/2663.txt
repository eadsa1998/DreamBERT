I live on the tip of a peninsula in a tropical climate. A man has been killed or injured (a king?) and he is searching out the man who did it. He chases him around and gets him cornered as he leaps in a river exhausted. The man says, "I'm going to take a river foot," meaning he will slice the tendons of his heal or will chop off his foot. The chased man nods tiredly. Anything is better than being on the constant run. He then lays his head under the water prepared to endure the pain. Someone grabs his foot up and holds it for the knife and I wonder if the man can hold his breath that long. It's going to be bloody and hurt, but the relief of being able to stop running will be worth it.
