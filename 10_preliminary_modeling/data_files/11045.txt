A theater. I am sitting with R (a boy I have been dating recently who is becoming somewhat of a problem because he insists upon getting serious). We are sitting in a section of the auditorium which seems to be right under the stage, although everything on the stage is visible. The seats are very comfortable, actually more like lounging chairs. A man comes out and leads the audience in some community singing which isn't too successful, since very few know the song. The melody was familiar, but I didn't know the words. Then a Negro dressed in old clothes comes out on the stage. I recall having seen his picture in the radio section of the newspaper as a star. He sings a song, with interludes of a shuffling sort of dance step. The audience applauds, particularly a Negro woman in the front row, and I think to myself as I see that, that this is as it should be. During this act R, who has his arm around my shoulders, kisses me twice, which I permit, but do not respond to as I don't want to encourage him. I look backstage and see a blonde showgirl apparently preparing for the next act. Her size is out of proportion to the people around her and she appears by comparison to be about 40 feet tall.
