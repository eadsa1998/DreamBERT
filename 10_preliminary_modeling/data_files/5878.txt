I am in a hurry to get to Pittsburg and hurry off to the RR station to ask when next train goes. On the way see a phone and someone using it and I decide to wait and use phone. Apparently find a time table and twist it around trying to determine which train is which, but am unable to figure it out. The guy is still on the phone and I am getting extremely impatient.
