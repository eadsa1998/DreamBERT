This was a weird obsessive dream about 'process'. Four resources were endlessly being dished out. It turned into a thing about onions: four ways to prepare onions so that they could be as different as possible - chutney, deep fried, soup and something else. I woke up with a thick head and sore eyes as if I'd been drinking the night before but I hadn't.
