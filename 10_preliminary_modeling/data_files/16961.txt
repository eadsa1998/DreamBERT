I'm in the sea swimming. It is shallow and beautifully clear, somewhere warm and tropical. With me is my friend Ralph. We are there to try to catch fish. The fish we are trying to catch look like clown fish - the orange and white ones. There are shoals of them which we round up easily, and then we pick them out of the water with our hands. Eventually we have a bagful. We walk along the shore and find a row of houses on the beach. Perhaps we are in Japan, because these houses seem to be made of paper with many square or rectangular panels, some of which are doors. Some people that Ralph knows lives in one of the houses. We head towards the house, but first we run into an old university friend Jackie. She lives a few houses away apparently. I let myself into her house, and her flatmate lets me store my fish in their freezer.
