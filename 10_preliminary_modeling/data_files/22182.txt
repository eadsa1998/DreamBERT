I dreamt about my older sister who doesn't live in Lima (she's married). Well, the two of us had gone out to look for black clothing because she (Carol) had died, but I was very worried because I didn't know how to tell her she had died and that the wake was at the supermarket. When we got home, I looked for my parents, but the maid told me they were at the wake, so I went to my room and Carol came to me and asked me, "Where is my wake?" I was in a jam, trying to explain to her it was at the supermarket, without telling her so, so that she wouldn't be offended. Then I went to the wake and when I got to the supermarket, the coffin was alongside the cash register and people came in and out, doing their shopping without paying any attention to the coffin. I thought that it was strange for my family to have brought my sister's body here for the wake. None of the family was at the supermarket, so I went back home and found the dead person (Carol) and tried to keep her from going to her wake, first because it was at the supermarket, and secondly because no one in the family was there. I thought she would be very offended if she saw or found out this. Carol is tall, she has long wavy hair and is rather fat. The maid is old, medium-sized and fat. I don't remember any more.
