I left home and went to visit my friends. Suddenly I got hold of a motorcycle and was driving my girlfriend around all afternoon. I went up and down hills, I enjoyed feeling the sensation of speed. Suddenly I started to smoke pot and I felt I was sliding through strange-shaped tunnels and I felt an unending joy. All of a sudden I woke up startled.
