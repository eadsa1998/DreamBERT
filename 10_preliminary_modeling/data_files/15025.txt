I took Ezra to McDonald's because he was working. We were late because we went somewhere and I had said that we had to leave but they were like 'there's plenty of time' (he started at 6pm). I said it was 6:30pm (it was 6.27). We quickly went there. I hung around for a bit and I actually worked there too. I was just about to leave and this Indian guy wanted a muffin, saying that he wanted "a small one" and I asked "a small what?" and I eventually figured out he meant muffin. Music was playing on a television and Good Man in a Bad Time came on and I was like "I love this song".
