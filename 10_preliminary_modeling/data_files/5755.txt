[1997-06-06] I dreamed that a couple was involved in some kind of sexual activity and part of it involved going to this hotel bar where we are and having a couple of drinks really fast just to heighten their excitement. They were evidently sexually involved publicly. I'm not sure what they were doing but you could hear them laughing and carrying on. Part of this whole process was they insisted, that I have to have a drink, and I said "I don't drink, I'll have a Coke" and the guy at the bar said here, I'll give you just what they ordered for you and I tasted it and it was just straight whiskey on the rocks and I thought "Boy, this really tastes good, and I don't care if I don't drink or if 'm an alcoholic, I'm going to drink this stuff anyway. Then I was walking back to my room, tasting my drink thinking "Man the aroma and the flavor of this stuff is just great! I've missed this for a long time."
