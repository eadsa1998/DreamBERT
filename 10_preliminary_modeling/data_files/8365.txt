We were remodeling and/or redecorating living spaces for a number of different people. I say we but I don't know who the people were that were working with me on this. The living spaces we were working on must have been fairly unusual. I don't remember what the houses looked like only the spaces we were working with. We had designed cubes that were completely open on one side. They were just slightly smaller than the size of the room we were working on. These cubes could be lifted with a fork-lift and slid into the room. Rather than accessing through a door the owner would access through the open wall of this cube. It appears that there is no other part of the structure/home around the frame that we slide the cube into. All of the cubes we were doing seemed to be home office spaces. We had designed them all at one time. We designed several different looks based on certain needs. Then we identified which look was best for each person. At one point the content of the cubes was more like text on a page rather than a room layout. We decided that one person would need several cubes because it was simply way too much text for one page and that multiple cubes was not a good option - maybe not an option at all. I came up with the idea of putting the text onto computer files so the person would have easy access. I said this would actually work much better for them than simply laying it out in the cube anyway. This then freed up the cube for one of the room designs we had done and were using for the other people.
