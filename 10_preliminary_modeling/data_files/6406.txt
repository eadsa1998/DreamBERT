I'm sitting outside with my friends on a massive lawn. We are having a picnic or something. I suddenly realize, as I stand up, that when I press down on the raw earth, I can make sounds. Every time I push down on a place, it forces some air in air pockets out through the grains of dirt, and it makes a farting noise with a note to it, kind of like a tuba. After playing a bit of a song, the earth becomes seriously disturbed, and big rocks and chunks of brick lay everywhere. I guess we had too much fun. Music seems to emanate from beneath these bricks. After we replaced the earth, and I "play" it a few more times only to get the same results, we realize that the underground brick and concrete structure is part of a prison. In fact, the part where they put the most dangerous criminals, and we all struggle in vain to replace the bricks and concrete and dirt before it is too late and the prisoners escape and kill us!! The dreams ends when I jump off the ground and fly away.
