We were up in the territory of Modern Media College and I only had like two or three days, maybe even two or three hours before I started classes there. And we were like outside in like a park area, and I had to go into the building to use the bathroom, and I needed to ask the counselor and the secretary for a calendar of like time off and stuff like that. And so I went in this like real just blah building and it was like the lady who came out wouldn't let me go any further until I showed her my ID and I could prove that I was going to be a student in a few days. And I dreamt that there was this man counselor that I knew that she directed me towards that I had a feeling that I had had a real technical discussion with before, and that I felt real comfortable with. And he wanted to know if I had decided what kind of mixer board was best for me, and I told him I hadn't yet. And I got the calendar and I went back outside and then I woke up.
