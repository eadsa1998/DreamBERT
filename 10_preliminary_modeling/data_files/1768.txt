I tell Howard (who is the boss) I want to stop work. He jeers at me. He says, "Go ahead, but it won't work the way you planned. They won't permit you to come back part time." He's uppity and cold. I rush past his secretary to get into his office and I throw my resignation letter at him. It lands on the floor.
