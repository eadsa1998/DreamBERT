The dream started in a way that was odd. I was in a rocket flying to some body out in space. There was only one other person aboard: my brother who was my copilot. Something went wrong with a wiring system outside the ship so I had to go out in a spacesuit and fix it. While I was out there we came in contact with the gravitational pull of some planet and I fell off the hull of our ship. The last thing I remember was falling through space and going through different colored cloud layers that turn my skin the color of the cloud layer. I woke up just as I was about to hit a planet's surface.
