I'm looking for the sugar-free candies. I ask the owner (male, older). He isn't sure, so I poke around. I go to the end where two piles of candy are. One pile has a wrapping; looks like a miniature package of baloney. I'm trying to read the ingredients and can't really see the words. I lean on the counter, my butt sticking out. The owner says, "Look, that man is here and he's with your wife." I look up and see a woman with dark hair and am more interested in seeing the ingredients of this candy. I pay no more attention to the couple. He's stealing her and she's a slut, so who cares.
