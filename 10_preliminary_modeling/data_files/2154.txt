A man and I approach an Indian man seated on a bus. I offer him a $5 bill for something he did for me. He contemptuously slaps it out of my hand, hard. "Do not offer me money. I don't want anything," he says. I look to the man (Howard, the drummer) and he smiles and shrugs. "Offer to buy him a cup of coffee," he suggests. I do so. The Indian guy says, "Oh, OK," and I start to go get the coffee. "Not too much sugar," he calls after me. I comply.
