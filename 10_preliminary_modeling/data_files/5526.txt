C and I were going to a beach and we had to walk down quite a steep incline and the path was very narrow, and between very prickly bushes, possibly holly bushes. They grabbed at our clothing and scratched our arms and legs, but it wasn't painful at all. They were very pretty glossy green leaves and red berries and the path was just wide enough for one foot so you had to place one foot directly in front of the other. We finally got down to the beach but there was no beach, there were just big rocks, and she clambered up onto a big rock, and I was just behind her and I looked out and there was a huge wave coming and I screamed "C watch out for the wave!" and she clung to her rock which she was on and which had a point on it, and the water engulfed both of us and through the water I could see her hanging onto the rock and I tried to reach her but I couldn't because the water was so powerful, and when the water subsided, she was gone and I was totally dry and I just shouted at the top of my lungs "Oh God! C come back!". I woke up very, very startled.
