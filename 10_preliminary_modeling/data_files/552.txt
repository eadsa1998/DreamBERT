I am in a storage room that seems to be in the he place where I worked 20 years ago. An orchestra is playing. There are two men, in particular, one black and one white. The black man is playing New Orleans jazz piano. I have several stuffed turkeys to give to kids but I only give out four. There is a back door and it is grassy and hilly outside. We were going to go to a lake where my in-laws had a cabin but it is close to dark so I decide to give the turkeys out at the office.
