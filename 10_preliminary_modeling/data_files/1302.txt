I want to invent something or discover something no one else has. I decide to time a flock of sheep as they run up a steep hill. I run up the hill with them to chase them, so they don't scatter. If I take it one step at a time, I know I'll make it. I get to the top and find Lydia's house. I go in to wait. We chat. I see there are some dishes to do. I race with Lydia to get to the sink first. I dip my fingers in the water and say, "Me first." We laugh. She finally gives in and lets me. I start washing. I think I see one of my daughters in the sink. I put my hands on my hips and say, "Ellie, get out of there now." A man is watching all this and smiles. Then I don't see her. I say, "How embarrassing. I thought she was in the sink." My cousin Deirdre is there. As I'm washing dishes, Doug and Lydia tell me about a new kind of wool they've discovered. The sheep gave a wool that is a natural polyester. I look at the knitted sweaters and admire how nice they look and feel. Then Lydia goes outside. Suddenly she wells to me to get the gun off the top of the refrigerator and save her. She is being attacked by a beast. She is screaming. I run to look for the gun. I find lots of junk and pliers but no gun. I feel helpless and frustrated and I paw through the junk frantically. She keeps crying out for me. I feel hideous. I try to make a gun appear via using my thinking powers, but no dice.
