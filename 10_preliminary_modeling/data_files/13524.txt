I went to this spooky place in a forest. I was with other people. There was a castle and we were told to sleep outside somewhere. This guy and girl (I was now not there and it was third person) went into this caravan. Later some people and some dogs went to check if people were asleep. They went in the caravan and saw them awake but left them. Then all these creatures came out from the castle. One of them was this sort of hot guy with big hair. Nana and I later found out by looking through a book that he was played by Angus Young. Later, the guy and girl went outside and this lady drove past and then people were coming that way so they went back inside and pretended to be having sex and the lady pretended to be hanging around.
