This dream consisted merely of seeing one of my professors faces very close. He appeared to be smiling and very friendly and I had the feeling that he wished to help me through some difficulty which I had (what it was I don't remember). When I awoke, I had the feeling that this was part of a long dream with a series of events in them. For some reason this was all I could remember of it. I had a vague feeling that other students were standing around with me.
