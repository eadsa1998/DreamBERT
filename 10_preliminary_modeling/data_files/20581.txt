I was on a bed in a room. Another man was in a nearby bed. A woman came into the room and the man told me she did not wear panties. But when she sat down, I saw that she was wearing pink panties. I left the room to find a toilet. I went into a toilet, but there were women there, and I was embarrassed at the thought of using it in their presence, so I left and looked into some nearby stores for a restroom. But they only had telephone booths, and no restrooms. I was getting annoyed.
