I was at home, which was a new house. I was in the lounge watching TV, which was a movie that was a cross between Lord of the Flies and Battle Royale. A pregnant lady had died. People had forgotten about the island they were on and they now had to fend for themselves. At the end of the movie it zoomed into a face of a small black boy, hiding in the trees. I thought he saw someone coming (at our house). My room had thin curtains on the window. When walking into the room, my bed was in the middle of the room coming out from the wall towards the window, which was on the left wall from the door. There was a desk just in front of the window. There was a small stream and a lot of bush and trees outside the window. Dad's room was across from it. I went to my room and I thought I saw a shadow of a head outside and I tried to call out to Dad, but no noise came out.
