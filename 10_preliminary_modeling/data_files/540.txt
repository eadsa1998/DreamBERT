I am at my parent's home talking to a female friend on the phone. I am trying to eat some hot cereal as I am very hungry but I keep getting interrupted. A lady cop who is new in town comes to the door. She has noticed as I just did that the top floor of the place where I work has been made into a free reading room for kids and she asks if anyone does anything around here that isn't free. It concerns her that no one is making any money. She is in the hall and my friend, Mary, is with her. As we speak a nurse comes and I look out and a big aircraft is flying over very low and cutting all the power lines. I am very frightened and try to hide so they can't see me. I eat my cereal even so because I am still hungry and I realize it may be a long time before I get any more.
