I seem to be in a row boat, along with several other people, some one (?Joe Peters) is reading aloud from a newspaper certain reports on government securities. One of these securities is insurance, another stock in certain ships. Ohler tells me I am fortunate to have $15,000 insurance. This arouses a desire in me to buy some of the described government securities, and I ask how this may be done; but I am told that it is difficult or impossible to find these securities, except for a certain agent who ... me several years ago.
