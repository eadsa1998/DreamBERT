Dream in the tent with the mountain leprechauns or elves as the rain was pouring down. They tried to convince me that everything was ok, and I didn't need to worry and I could leave at any time. Though I knew it was not ok. They nearly convinced me. Can I leave now? Yes, of course. Just first come over here for a bit. I did that over and over. Like walking around a cylinder producing its own gravity in space. I was worried about my brother James. I didn't know where he was. I wanted to get out first and find him. The elves from the mountain were tricky, and I didn't trust them, but had no choice since I was so tired and a little worried.
