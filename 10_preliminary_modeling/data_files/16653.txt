I was going to study at Modern Media College and Mom and I were driving to Centerville ___________, and we were going to get set up. For the first two months I was going to study in Westportrsburg and have online classes there. And for the next month I was going to an apartment to stay over there. And then we would see what happened after that. This neighbor of mine to the west, she was helping me and advising me on which apartment to pick and stuff like that. And as Mom and I were driving down there, I think that for some reason when we got there, Mom parked kind of crooked when she went to go do something else. And I think I tried to move the car so that it wouldn't be crooked, and I realized that I wasn't going to be able to move it without risking doing serious damage, in other words running into something. [laugh] Let's see; what else? I think that we were staying overnight in this apartment, and it was kind of really little, and I'm trying to remember. I think maybe it was the next door neighbor who walked me to the school and then next thing I know, I was home and I was in Keith's front yard and there were a bunch of people dressed up with like Alice and different things, and I looked in one of the rooms ______________________. _____________________ set up ______________________. And then I woke up. Keith really did go to Modern Media College, and Saturday I went up __________ Fine Arts. No, I was in Great Explorations __________ and they were doing the Mad Hatter's Tea Party and everybody was dressed up like Alice In Wonderland.
