I was at a fair with Molly and then we lost our moms, so we went to a mall and we bought clothes and rings and diamonds and then I bought a kitten and a puppy. Then we put all our stuff in a cart and we said "let's go home," so we waited in the parking lot to see if our moms would come by and they did, but they completely ignored us. And then I started crying and this nice guy came by with a big bus and he said, "want to come on a ride?" and I said "yes, can we live with you?" and he said "yes, I live in my bus" and I looked behind us and there was a whole farm of animals and we put our stuff in a room and then we went home.
