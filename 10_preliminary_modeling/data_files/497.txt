I am given a gift, a milky white glass tray with streaks of color in it. The tray is in a wicker basket with cookies which are in the shape of stars and other shapes, but the cookies are also made of glass. I found the gift in the Penney Store in the town where I grew up. Also while I am in the store I try on a green knit cap and a clerk sees me. I almost walked out with the cap. I had also set my hair in the store with clips from a package and I have to put them back. My husband is with me in the store.
