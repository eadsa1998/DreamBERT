I was at Mom's. The people next door were being shifty. I was listening to my iPod, outside sitting on the edge of the front yard, with my feet hanging over some bricks. I also had my Mp3 player, two bits of paper and two water bottles. Cuddles took my Mp3 player. A lady from next door came over and took all my stuff except for my iPod, which I refused to give up. I kept kicking her in the face. She said that she would take my iPod by Friday (it was Tuesday or something). I told Mom, but she didn't care. I was then at home, except it was Darren and Mom's place. I heard a noise and some singing and went into Dad's room and woke Darren. I told him that the people were here. I peeked out and Mom came out of the toilet. I asked if it was her that had been singing. She said no and then the bad guys appeared. I went back to my room and closed my door. They barged in. There were four guys and one girl (I think). One of the guys's decided that he didn't want to do this and he tried to push two of the guys out of the room. He couldn't and they set him on fire. I managed to run into Dad's room. While running, I tripped over this blonde guy who didn't try to stop me and I got a wine bottle and something else. I killed two of the guys. I was hitting the blonde guy a bit. An ambulance came for the burnt guy.
