I was driving to Capitola with Cori Matthews. We pulled into a parking lot, and a guy reached in my window. I pushed him away and we rolled up our windows. Anne and her mom tried to talk to us. We yelled that a bad guy was in the lot. He chased us out. Setting: In the parking lot. Characters: Cori Matthews (a TV star), Anne and her mom (my friend), and a bad guy (unknown). Feelings and Thoughts: Terrified. The guy could have killed me.
