I was operating my machine in the shop. I forgot about one and the next day I remembered I forgot to load that one machine and it ran empty the next day. So I ran it now. Then I went away and I heard a loud noise like something heavy falling on the floor. I came by one of my machines and I noticed on one of my machines two pulleys came loose from the shaft of the machine and they fell down on the floor. The boss dismissed or discharged one of the workers.
