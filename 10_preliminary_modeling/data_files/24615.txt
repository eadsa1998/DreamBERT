My dream was very confusing, and at times impossible to understand. Therefore, I don't remember hardly any of it. The vague idea was I was lost. I think there was a big crowd of unfamiliar faces. Setting: Outside somewhere. Characters: A big crowd of people I didn't know. There was me, too. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared. I don't see why I can't remember. Parts of it I was forced to make up.
