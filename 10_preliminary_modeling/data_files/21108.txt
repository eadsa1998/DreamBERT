I was flying fast and was afraid I would run into some electric or telephone wire as I came to them. I picked up a small girl and flew around with her. Wiatrack's car was burning on the rear end of the tank. I was driving it. We stopped by a water trough and I was going to put it out. When I wanted to stop it, I put on the emergency brake, but the car rolled downhill. I put on the brake pedal and it kept on rolling downhill and finally stopped. Kotnik was setting near a girl's legs and looking at them. I got close to the front of the car and there were small pin holes where the gas was squirting out. Bill and I went into the storage room. The place looked like a manure pile and Bill said it was bird shit. I saw some small springs and one large and very fine spring. A bull was chasing me. I flew and he flew after me. He got near me and I cocked my fist at him and he beat it. I was collecting money from the barber. I had a wheelbarrow full of money.
