I come home from work to my parent's house and my father (who is dead) is there. Everyone is surprised. I ask him how he got back. He doesn't know. It just happened he said. He followed his brother-in-law (who is also dead) and some others. My brother comes home and is angry for me for bringing my dad back. He thinks I should have left things alone. I try to explain that I didn't do it. My dad is sad because nobody wants him around.
