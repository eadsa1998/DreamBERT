We were outside somewhere and I was driving to get out. Then there were all these dead ends in this carpark, so I drove over some curbs, but I went up this road and it went between these two waterslides (it wasn't actually a road). Then we were walking and the only way to get out was by going down this part of the waterslide. We had to lie down strangely so that it wouldn't hurt. Then this girl and I went into this section of the place to find the president, so we could get home. This guy saw us and started coming after us. Someone said something about David Palmer (24) and one of us were like "David Palmer is gone". Then someone said something and realized it was the president. He was black and bald and he turned around and I said "Oh, Wayne!". It was Wayne Palmer (24). We were talking to him and the girl said a gigantic thing had eaten her money. He was talking to me about wine and I said "I only drink water man". Wayne's assistant said there was "a bloody bone" in the boot of this car. Then it was Easter and we were at Nana's. For some reason, Eugene, Darius, Jeremiah and the others were there too. They were sitting at the big table and I was on the computer. They wanted to play Pub Krawl. Eventually Dad, Ezra and I were at the table too. Dad picked the Pub Krawl box up and I said "We haven't played that in years!" and I was thinking that we used to play it with Classmate-M-19 (from Coldspring).
