I am in a house on a high and steep hillside and observing some animals, strange-looking beasts, all lurking around the base of a tree. Next morning I look out the window and down to the tree and it is gone. But I see another a short way off, but am sure that it is a new tree, one I didn't notice the evening before. I see a strange new bird fly away from it, but as it gets closer, I am disappointed to note it is a rather common species of butterfly.
