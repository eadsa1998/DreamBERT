 There is a group of people. Some of there died. They were soldiers. There is a funeral. I am talking with my dad. I am dreaming (in the dream) that I talk with my dad about the interpretation of a dream. I cry in that dream. I cry in the dream of the dream. It is a release. I think it may have something to do with a past relationship with my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas.
