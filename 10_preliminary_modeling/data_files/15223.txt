I was outside somewhere. There were clouds and they were very vivid and very dark grey. There was a storm coming and I had to get inside. I found cover and then started pouring down. Then it was The Soprano's and I was at their house which was different. I went to the toilet and there were two doors to it. I opened one door and someone pushed back and I realised Meadow was in there. Later I went out and then it was a movie and this girl and guy were separated from each other. They were both under separate cover from the rain but to get to each other they had to walk a fair way outside. I was seeing from the girl's point of view and she went up the stairs and around to him. They kissed and hugged and then went to go find better cover. Then Farrah had been seen this guy but Justin Bieber was staying in the same area and she liked him. She snuck out one night and I saw her. She ran into a room but I heard someone coming and I hid behind a pillar. They went away and I ran into the same room. She was hiding under the bed and I joined her. Someone came in but as they were leaving they caught us. Her mother was angry and yelling at both of us and I yelled at her while I was alone with her saying 'big deal'.
