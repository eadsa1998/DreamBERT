I was out trying to get to a Democrats' meeting. I got a tip from my editor that it was not far -- but I had to hurry. It was a Saturday , and I had just woken up. I was not fully prepared and had not done my background research, so I headed out. I wondered if it was where the meeting had been in the past. I was near the upper west side, just north of downtown, near a big museum and art center. I looked around. I came to a college that had a campus within the city. One of those small city colleges. There was a map. It had numbered buildings. It didn't help. I called the Democrats. The person on the other line said, "oh, it's not important this time." I got angry. "Look, you can't do that." he told me where it was -- there were indeed two locations, and this one was across town. I hurried away. I thought about taking public transportation, but figured it would be faster to walk. I started turning around the iron rails leading down, but turned away. I wanted to look at a map.
