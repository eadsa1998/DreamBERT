 I wake up in my bedroom at home. It is 2:03 am. There are drunken people outside. I go to the big window in my bedroom and look out. They are throwing rocks at our house, breaking windows. I quickly shut the light off in my room so they don't see me. I hurry downstairs. The lights are all off. I crouch down so they don't see me as I pass by the windows. I call 911, and go over to the corner of the house by the front entry, because it offers the most protection. The 911 operator answers. I tell her my house is being vandalized and tell her my address. She knows my name and tells me to calm down. Then the lights inside the house are on. One of the vandals has come in and is offering me money not to get the police involved. It looks like a $20 bill, two $5 bills, and some $1 bills. I say to the vandal, "No way! You are paying for this (damage)." Then all of the vandals are in my living room. They have admitted guilt. Among them are two people I know from high school, Dimitri Klein and John Stoner. John's last name is actually Stromer, but now I know it is Stoner. I am the goody-two-shoes, and fell bad about getting these guys in trouble, but I want to so I stick with it. One kid mocks me for being good. This will go on their records, I know. All at once the kids walk out of the house. There is only one police officer there, and he can't stop all of them. They are going to get their friends for a big last-day-of-school party. They will all come back to my house and totally rip it apart: vandalize it. One kid that I think is with them comes in the back door. He has blond hair. I punch him. He grabs two knives and goes out to try to stop the other kids. I say out loud repeatedly, "We gotta get out of here! I mean it!"
