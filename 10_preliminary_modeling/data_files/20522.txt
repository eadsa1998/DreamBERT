I was with several others. We were going into a building where we worked. We had to walk on a narrow ledge several stories above the ground. The ledge overlooked a shaft that resembled an elevator shaft. I was worried about falling. We had to get to the door on the other side of the shaft. When I got inside, I saw that I was a half hour late. I felt that I should be excused because of the trouble I had to get into the building.
