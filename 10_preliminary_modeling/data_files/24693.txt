I was at the Santa Cruz Beach and Boardwalk. My mom and dad were with me. We went to the Log Ride. We got in line and put our backpack and jackets by the water. Oh, no! Our log and some of the others started going down a different river! Then we had to get out of the log and take our flippers off. Then we got back in line. Three teenagers came. Two of them were teasing the other one. They were saying things like, "You can't go on this ride, you have to be over 14." Then she would say, "Look at all these younger kids." She had a shirt from a jewelry store that's in Town &amp; Country Village. When the line moved up we passed a black boy and two black women. The boy looked at these two computers and then he left. We moved up in line again. Setting: Santa Cruz Beach and Boardwalk, on the Log Ride. Characters: Mom &amp; Dad, three teenagers (one looked familiar), two black women (unknown), and a black boy (sort of familiar). Feelings and Thoughts: Worried. When we went down the other river, I was really worried.
