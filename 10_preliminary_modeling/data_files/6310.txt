My second dream had to deal with me getting into an accident that day. All I kept dreaming was looking in my rearview mirror and seeing a car coming right for me nonstop. He then slammed into me and sent me flying. It was more of a nightmare that really did happen. I just hope it's something I never have to live or sleep through again.
