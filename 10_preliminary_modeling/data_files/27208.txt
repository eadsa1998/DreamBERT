I dreamt I was out on the end of a break water in the lake. At a battered shack in which furniture was sold. The furniture was modernistic design and very beautiful. I left the shack and on the way back to 1and I watched the fisherman. About 20 feet from shore I slipped off the rock. I was holding onto one rock and the waves were washing over and around me. I was not in the least bit afraid but only interested in the beauty of the breaking waves. I next found myself on land and the fishermen were showing me their tackle. They made a fishing rod of boxes of graduated sizes. The rod was covered with wallpaper with big dark red roses on it like that on my bedroom ceiling. I then ascended some old wooden steps up to the cliff that overlooked the lake. I walked through a meadow of tall grass out to a point overlooking the lake. My grandmother (90 yrs. old) was there planting a small plant.
