I was at a place that looked like school. We were at the front of the school next to the carpark. I was being held captive along with a bunch of guys. One was really hot, but he got killed escaping. We were given dinner on this long table and there was lots of food. There was a skinny Asian and a skinny guy there. I suggested that they [our captives] were going to eat us because the rest of us were 'chunky'. The people holding us were actually aliens (they looked like a slimy version of the rhino in season three, episode one of Doctor Who). I said if the skinny one was called out, then they were eating us. They got called. One of the skinny ones escaped and was on a train, but the aliens came. Then it was a game and this guy was running along the side of the train and he had to jump on this ledge and get on the train. Mittens was somewhere and I said "How am I going to eat you?". I was in this room and they turned off the electricity and my fan.
